i am convinc that a major of american still consid themselv conserv or right of center __PUNCT__
thei still prefer common sens conservat to the altern __PUNCT__
thei want their govern to oper as their famili oper __PUNCT__ on a realist budget __PUNCT__ with an ey on the futur that spurn self __PUNCT__ indulg in the short term for the sake of last prosper __PUNCT__ that respect hard work and individu initi __PUNCT__ and that show no favorit to on group of american over anoth __PUNCT__
american had elect us to chang govern __PUNCT__ and thei reject us becaus thei believ govern had chang us __PUNCT__
we must spend the next two year reacquaint the public and ourselv with the reason we came to offic in the first place __PUNCT__ to serv a caus greater than our self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__

we believ in increas wealth and expand opportun __PUNCT__ in low tax __PUNCT__ fiscal disciplin __PUNCT__ free trade and open market __PUNCT__
we believ in competit __PUNCT__ reward hard work and risk taker and let peopl keep the fruit of their labor __PUNCT__
we believ in work __PUNCT__ faith __PUNCT__ servic __PUNCT__ a cultur of life __PUNCT__ person respons __PUNCT__

common sens conserv believ that the govern that govern least govern best __PUNCT__ that govern should do onli those thing individu cannot do for themselv __PUNCT__ and do them effici __PUNCT__
much ride on that principl __PUNCT__ the integr of the govern __PUNCT__ our prosper __PUNCT__ and everi american self __PUNCT__ respect __PUNCT__ which depend __PUNCT__ as it alwai ha __PUNCT__ on on own decis and action __PUNCT__ and cannot be provid as anoth govern benefit __PUNCT__
stand up for these valu __PUNCT__
argu our principl for our countri sake and not just our __PUNCT__

don't hide from hard challeng __PUNCT__
act on principl __PUNCT__
show american there ar thing that matter more to us than our incumb __PUNCT__
do the right thing __PUNCT__ and the polit will take care of itself __PUNCT__
hypocrisi __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is the most obviou of polit sin __PUNCT__
and the peopl will punish it __PUNCT__
we were elect to reduc the size of govern and enlarg the sphere of free and privat initi __PUNCT__
then we lavish monei __PUNCT__ in a time of war __PUNCT__ on thousand of project of dubiou __PUNCT__ if ani __PUNCT__ public valu __PUNCT__
we respond to a problem face some american by provid everi retir american with a prescript drug benefit __PUNCT__ and ad anoth trillion dollar to a bankrupt entitl __PUNCT__
we increas the size of govern in the fals hope that we could bribe the public into keep us in offic __PUNCT__
and the peopl punish us __PUNCT__
we lost our principl and our major __PUNCT__
and there is no wai to recov our major without recov our principl first __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ ronald reagan veto a highwai bill becaus it had __NUM__ earmark __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ a republican congress pass a highwai bill with __NUM__ special project cost the taxpay twenti __PUNCT__ four billion dollar __PUNCT__
those and other earmark pass by a republican congress includ fifti million for an indoor rainforest __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ for a teapot museum __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ for an inner harmoni foundat and well center __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ million for a bridg to nowher __PUNCT__
i didn't see those project in the fine print of the contract with america __PUNCT__ and neither did the voter __PUNCT__
a centuri ago __PUNCT__ teddi roosevelt took on the special interest __PUNCT__
let the parti of teddi roosevelt take the lead in clean up washington todai __PUNCT__
let start with pork barrel spend and corpor welfar __PUNCT__ elimin all earmark __PUNCT__ pass the line item veto __PUNCT__ emploi honest budget account __PUNCT__ and end emerg spend bill for non __PUNCT__ emerg as a wai around budget limit __PUNCT__
let ban all gift from lobbyist to lawmak __PUNCT__ and keep lobbyist off the floor of the hous and senat __PUNCT__
we have more signific prioriti ahead of us than find new wai to spend monei unwis __PUNCT__
when social secur wa establish __PUNCT__ forti __PUNCT__ on worker support a singl retire __PUNCT__ todai it three __PUNCT__
health care cost add more to the cost of a new car manufactur in the u. __PUNCT__ than steel __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ spend on social secur __PUNCT__ medicar and medicaid __PUNCT__ along with interest on the nation debt __PUNCT__ will consum __NUM__ cent out of everi feder dollar __PUNCT__
we can leav these difficult problem to our unlucki successor __PUNCT__ after thei grown wors __PUNCT__ and harder to fix __PUNCT__
or we can bring all parti to the tabl __PUNCT__ and hammer out a principl solut that make the difficult choic necessari to support the need of retire __PUNCT__ promot high qualiti health care at lower cost __PUNCT__ protect the futur secur of worker __PUNCT__ and restor the bond of trust between the gener __PUNCT__
we can do the same on the issu of immigr __PUNCT__
i understand the magnitud of the problem __PUNCT__
we can do all that is possibl to defend our border from illeg immigr __PUNCT__ and affirm the rule of law __PUNCT__
when we have made these improv __PUNCT__ we must still recogn that job opportun here and poverti elsewher in the world will still attract immigr desper to improv their live __PUNCT__ and who will us increasingli desper measur to do so __PUNCT__
we can devis a ration and fair process __PUNCT__ which protect our secur and affirm america promis as a land of opportun __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ chang is come at american faster todai than ever befor __PUNCT__
fifti year ago __PUNCT__ we produc and sold almost entir for our domest market __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we compet in a global marketplac against __NUM__ billion chines and __NUM__ billion indian __PUNCT__
over the last two decad __PUNCT__ becaus we have expand free trade and open market __PUNCT__ the number of peopl live in extrem poverti drop by more than __NUM__ million in china and __NUM__ million in india __PUNCT__
as their economi grow __PUNCT__ develop nation offer not just competit __PUNCT__ but vast new consum market for american good and servic __PUNCT__
and rais hundr of million of peopl from poverti is the best shield against the attract of extrem __PUNCT__
thank __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ to republican econom polici __PUNCT__ america still ha the most product __PUNCT__ flexibl and energet free economi in the world __PUNCT__
but for mani american __PUNCT__ behind the posit macro __PUNCT__ econom statist __PUNCT__ onc reliabl bedrock like pension __PUNCT__ health care plan and even middl class job no longer feel secur __PUNCT__
and with scienc and technolog the kei to high wage job __PUNCT__ mani parent fear their children won't have the same opportun thei had __PUNCT__
in the global economi what you learn is what you earn __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ half of hispan and half of african american enter high school will never graduat __PUNCT__
by the __NUM__ grade __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ student in math and scienc score near the bottom of all industri nation __PUNCT__
as bill gate said __PUNCT__ thi isn't an accid or flaw in the system __PUNCT__
it is the system __PUNCT__
we need to shake up fail school bureaucraci with competit __PUNCT__ empow parent with choic __PUNCT__ remov barrier to qualifi instructor __PUNCT__ attract and reward superior teacher __PUNCT__ and have a fair __PUNCT__ but sure process to weed out incompet __PUNCT__
when ronald reagan took offic __PUNCT__ a blackberri wa someth you us to make jam __PUNCT__ todai it is a vital link in a wireless commun network that span the globe __PUNCT__
the broadband revolut is transform everi facet of commun from the internet to entertain to telephon servic to the deliveri of health care servic to suppli chain manag __PUNCT__
yet over the last decad __PUNCT__ america ha drop from __NUM__ in the world to __NUM__ in broadband develop and connect __PUNCT__
in the real world of global competit if we don't revers those trend __PUNCT__ we will risk our prosper and leav mani american in rural area far behind the rest of us __PUNCT__
the dogma of the quiet past __PUNCT__ abraham lincoln said __PUNCT__ ar inadequ to the stormi present __PUNCT__
as our case is new __PUNCT__ we must think anew __PUNCT__
we must disenthral ourselv __PUNCT__
across the gener __PUNCT__ those word still ring true __PUNCT__
to keep our nation prosper __PUNCT__ strong and grow we have to rethink __PUNCT__ reform and reinvent __PUNCT__ the wai we educ our children __PUNCT__ train our worker __PUNCT__ deliv health care servic __PUNCT__ support retire __PUNCT__ fuel our transport network __PUNCT__ stimul research and develop __PUNCT__ and har new technolog __PUNCT__
let that challeng be the new republican call __PUNCT__
let invit a genuin contest of idea within our parti and with the other parti __PUNCT__
for conservat __PUNCT__ as ronald reagan told us __PUNCT__ is not a narrow ideolog __PUNCT__
when i drive home at night __PUNCT__ i pass peopl wait at a bu stop __PUNCT__ and imagin their live __PUNCT__
a woman of hispan heritag __PUNCT__ mayb thirti five __PUNCT__ with three kid __PUNCT__ is wait for a bu on a cold street in the middl of the night so she can start her job __PUNCT__
while you and i ar home relax with our famili over dinner __PUNCT__ she and thousand like her ar work late into the night in the offic we left __PUNCT__ empti wast basket __PUNCT__ clean up kitchen __PUNCT__ scrub bathroom floor __PUNCT__
she __PUNCT__ like first gener american befor her __PUNCT__ is sacrif so her children can climb the ladder of american opportun __PUNCT__
when we debat simplifi the tax code __PUNCT__ which we must do __PUNCT__ i want us to rememb that admir woman __PUNCT__ and ask ourselv have we done all we can to remov obstacl for her and million like her to climb the next rung on the ladder __PUNCT__
i want us to rememb the worker in michigan __PUNCT__ in hi fifti __PUNCT__ who serv a tour in vietnam __PUNCT__ marri __PUNCT__ four kid __PUNCT__ two in colleg __PUNCT__ who work over thirti year at an auto part plant __PUNCT__ and never took a dai of sick leav __PUNCT__
last year hi plant downsiz and hi job wa elimin __PUNCT__ and he felt as if a trap door had open beneath him and he and hi famili had fallen through it __PUNCT__
america is the greatest trade nation in the world __PUNCT__
competit keep us strong __PUNCT__ and most american know that build a moat around america is a formula for stagnat __PUNCT__
i am proud of our parti leadership on free trade while the democrat embrac the siren song of protection __PUNCT__
but we ar not a nation of social darwinist __PUNCT__ who believ onli in the surviv of the fittest __PUNCT__
work in america is more than a paycheck __PUNCT__ it a sourc of pride __PUNCT__ self __PUNCT__ relianc and ident __PUNCT__
i want our parti to sai to that worker in michigan __PUNCT__ and thousand like him __PUNCT__ when you work hard __PUNCT__ plai by the rule __PUNCT__ serv your countri and commun __PUNCT__ and the burden of chang arriv suddenli on your doorstep __PUNCT__ you and your famili ar not just forgotten or dispos __PUNCT__
our most import oblig __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is to protect american from the threat pose by violent extremist who despis us __PUNCT__ our valu and modern itself __PUNCT__
thei ar moral monster __PUNCT__ but thei ar also a disciplin __PUNCT__ dedic movement driven by an apocalypt religi zeal __PUNCT__ which celebr martyrdom and murder __PUNCT__ ha access to scienc __PUNCT__ technolog and mass commun __PUNCT__ and is determin to acquir and us against us and our alli weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
the institut that sustain us throughout the cold war and the doctrin of deterr we reli on ar no longer adequ to protect us in a struggl where suicid bomber might obtain the world most terrifi weapon __PUNCT__
the war against terror is part of a larger struggl around the globe between the forc of integr and disintegr __PUNCT__ between builder and destroy __PUNCT__ between modern and those who would shackl human __PUNCT__ especi women __PUNCT__ in a feudal theocraci __PUNCT__
the question face us is not whether america will plai a larg and shape role in that struggl __PUNCT__ but whether we will plai it well or badli __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to take a holidai from histori __PUNCT__
to defend ourselv we must do everyth better and smarter than we did befor __PUNCT__
we must rethink __PUNCT__ renew and rebuild the structur and mission of our militari __PUNCT__ the capabl of our intellig and law enforc agenc __PUNCT__ the purpos of our allianc __PUNCT__ the reach and scope of our diplomaci __PUNCT__ and the capac of all branch of govern to defend us against the peril we now face __PUNCT__
we need to marshal all element of american power __PUNCT__ our militari __PUNCT__ economi __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ trade and technolog __PUNCT__
we need to strengthen our allianc __PUNCT__ and build support in other nation __PUNCT__ which must __PUNCT__ whether thei believ it or not __PUNCT__ confront the same threat to their wai of life that we do __PUNCT__
and we must marshal the power of our ideal __PUNCT__
some on both the left and right argu that our advocaci of democrat valu in iraq and elsewher is reckless and vain __PUNCT__ that freedom onli work for wealthi nation and western cultur __PUNCT__
but a world where our polit and econom valu had a realist chanc at becom a global creed wa the princip object of our foreign polici in the last centuri __PUNCT__
we conserv were it most effect advoc __PUNCT__ and it must remain our princip object todai __PUNCT__
we understood that our secur interest and the global advanc of our ideal ar inextric link __PUNCT__ and we sure didn't accept the notion that freedom wa the product of our power and wealth __PUNCT__
our wealth and power ar the product of our freedom __PUNCT__
we must appreci the secur implic of everi polici debat __PUNCT__
when we debat energi legisl __PUNCT__ for instanc __PUNCT__ we must recogn that the oil tanker stretch from the persian gulf to our port also channel petrodollar to oil dictatorship __PUNCT__ dollar us to bui centrifug to enrich uranium and build ballist missil __PUNCT__ to financ hama __PUNCT__ hezbollah and al qaeda __PUNCT__ and to fund the madrassa that train the next gener of terrorist __PUNCT__
we should lead our alli in an intern effort to reduc our mutual depend on oil __PUNCT__ emploi the servic of the brightest __PUNCT__ most creativ and accomplish scientist __PUNCT__ busi leader __PUNCT__ militari and govern offici __PUNCT__ could do as much to defeat the terrorist as ani other polici decis we make __PUNCT__ and would make american busi and worker the leader in develop new technolog __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ increas and acceler develop of nuclear energi is an import part of the solut __PUNCT__
we must also prepar __PUNCT__ across all level of govern __PUNCT__ far better than we have done __PUNCT__ to respond quickli and effect to anoth terrorist attack or natur calam __PUNCT__
i am not an advoc of big govern __PUNCT__ and the privat sector ha an import role to plai in homeland secur __PUNCT__
but when american confront a catastroph __PUNCT__ either natur or man __PUNCT__ made __PUNCT__ their govern __PUNCT__ across jurisdict __PUNCT__ should be organ and readi to deliv bottl drink water to dehydr babi and rescu the ag and infirm trap in a hospit with no electr __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i would like to speak briefli about the issu that is uppermost on the mind of american __PUNCT__
i make anoth trip to iraq in the come week __PUNCT__ and will speak more extens on the subject when i return __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ let me make a few observ here __PUNCT__
good and patriot american disagre about the wisdom of the origin decis to remov saddam hussein __PUNCT__
i support it and still do __PUNCT__
and clearli the countri is divid on the question of how we proce from here __PUNCT__
but i believ all american agre on thi __PUNCT__ to treat thi war as a partisan issu for the advantag of either parti would dishonor the sacrific of the young men and women who have fought in it so brave __PUNCT__
we have made a great mani mistak in thi war __PUNCT__ and histori will hold us to account for them just as the voter did last week __PUNCT__
the situat in iraq is dire __PUNCT__
but i believ victori is still attain __PUNCT__
and i am certain that our defeat there would be a catastroph __PUNCT__ and not onli for the unit state __PUNCT__
but we will not succe if we no longer have the will to win __PUNCT__
american ar tire of iraq becaus thei ar not convinc we can still win there without an intoler loss of addit live and resourc __PUNCT__
i understand that __PUNCT__
but in no other time ar we more moral oblig to speak the truth to our countri __PUNCT__ as we best see it __PUNCT__ than in a time of war __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__ without addit combat forc we will not win thi war __PUNCT__
we can __PUNCT__ perhap __PUNCT__ attempt to mitig somewhat the terribl consequ of our defeat __PUNCT__ but even that is an uncertain prospect __PUNCT__
we don't have adequ forc in iraq to clear and hold insurg stronghold __PUNCT__ to provid secur for rebuild local institut and economi __PUNCT__ to arrest sectarian violenc in baghdad and disarm sunni and shia militia __PUNCT__ to train the iraqi armi __PUNCT__ and to emb american personnel in weak __PUNCT__ and often corrupt iraqi polic unit __PUNCT__
we need to do all these thing if we ar to succe __PUNCT__
thei will not be easi to find __PUNCT__
the dai after 9/11 __PUNCT__ we should have begun to increas significantli the size of the armi and marin corp __PUNCT__
but we did not __PUNCT__
so we must turn again to those american and their famili who have alreadi sacrif so much in thi caus __PUNCT__
that is a veri hard thing to do __PUNCT__
but if we intend to win __PUNCT__ then we must __PUNCT__
it is not fair or easi to look a soldier in the ey and tell him he must shoulder a rifl again and risk hi life in a third tour in iraq __PUNCT__
mani of them will not want to __PUNCT__
thei feel have alreadi suffer far more than the rest of us to win thi war __PUNCT__
their famili will be even more upset __PUNCT__
and thei will be right __PUNCT__
it is a hard thing to ask of them __PUNCT__
but ask it we must __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ and i emphas if __PUNCT__ we have the will to win __PUNCT__
as troubl as it is __PUNCT__ i can ask a young marin to go back to iraq __PUNCT__
and he will go __PUNCT__ not happili perhap __PUNCT__ but he will go becaus he and hi comrad ar the first patriot among us __PUNCT__ and he will fight hi hardest there for hi countri to prevail __PUNCT__
of that __PUNCT__ i have no doubt __PUNCT__
but i can onli ask him if i share hi commit to victori __PUNCT__
what i cannot do is ask him to return to iraq __PUNCT__ to risk life and limb __PUNCT__ so that we might delai our defeat for a few month or a year __PUNCT__
that is more to ask than patriot requir __PUNCT__
it would not be in the interest of the countri __PUNCT__ and it sure would be an intoler sacrific for so poor an accomplish __PUNCT__
it would be immor __PUNCT__ and i could not do it __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ befor i leav __PUNCT__ let me again sai that though we suffer a tough defeat last week __PUNCT__ we will recov if we learn our lesson well and onc again offer american enlighten __PUNCT__ effect and principl leadership __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ after republican lost the presid and democrat held larg major in congress __PUNCT__ ronald reagan offer precis that kind of leadership __PUNCT__ and led us to victori in just three year time __PUNCT__
we can do it again if we lead and inspir as he did __PUNCT__
that wa not my first experi with presid reagan wisdom __PUNCT__
when i wa their involuntari guest __PUNCT__ the north vietnames went to great length to restrict new from home to the statement and activ of promin oppon of the war __PUNCT__
thei want us to believ that our countri had forgotten us __PUNCT__
thei never mention ronald reagan to us __PUNCT__ or plai hi speech over the camp loudspeak __PUNCT__
no matter __PUNCT__
we knew about him __PUNCT__
new addit to our rank told us how governor and mr __PUNCT__ reagan were commit to our liber and our caus __PUNCT__
thei were among the few promin american who did not subscrib to the then fashion notion that america and the west had enter our inevit declin __PUNCT__
we came home to a countri that had lost a war and the best sens of itself __PUNCT__ a countri beset by seriou social and econom problem __PUNCT__
assassin __PUNCT__ riot __PUNCT__ scandal __PUNCT__ contempt for polit __PUNCT__ religi and educ institut __PUNCT__ gave the appear that we had becom a dysfunct societi __PUNCT__
patriot wa sneer at __PUNCT__
the militari scorn __PUNCT__
and the world anticip the collaps of our global influenc __PUNCT__
the great __PUNCT__ robust democraci that had given it name to the centuri appear exhaust __PUNCT__
ronald reagan believ differ __PUNCT__
he possess an unshak faith in america spirit that prove more durabl than the prevail polit sentiment of the time __PUNCT__ and he becam presid to prove it __PUNCT__
hi confid wa a tonic to men who had come home eager to put the war behind us and for our countri to do likewis __PUNCT__
hi wa a faith that shout to tyrant __PUNCT__ tear down thi wall __PUNCT__
when wall were all i had for a world __PUNCT__ hi faith in our countri gave me hope in a desol place __PUNCT__
it wa the faith he share with my friend __PUNCT__ mike christian __PUNCT__
fellow american __PUNCT__ we can achiev whatev task we set for our countri __PUNCT__ and whatev task we set for our parti __PUNCT__ as long as we rememb why we came to washington in the first place __PUNCT__
we came to honor ronald reagan and mike christian faith in america __PUNCT__ the greatest nation and greatest forc for good on earth __PUNCT__
if we rememb that then all will be well for our parti and our countri __PUNCT__
thank you and god bless you __PUNCT__
