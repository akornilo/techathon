when our found father sign the document that declar our independ from great britain __PUNCT__ thei risk more than their live and properti for the caus __PUNCT__
thei pledg their most cherish possess their __PUNCT__ sacr honor __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the phrase seem littl more than a remind that __PUNCT__ onc upon a time __PUNCT__ we judg public offici and thei judg themselv by the sincer with which thei put our nation interest befor their own __PUNCT__
american who expect their elect repres to execut the respons of our offic with compet and integr ar often disappoint __PUNCT__
thei ar disappoint by our failur to address the big problem face our countri __PUNCT__ and make the necessari chang to govern to meet those challeng __PUNCT__
thei ar disappoint by politician who valu incumb over principl __PUNCT__ and by partisanship that is less a contest of idea than an uncivil brawl over the spoil of power __PUNCT__
and t hei ar disgust by the disgrac of public offici who trade their integr for person gain and advantag __PUNCT__
i am a conserv __PUNCT__ and i believ it is a healthi thing for american to be skeptic about the purpos and practic of public offici __PUNCT__ and refrain from expect too much from govern __PUNCT__
but it worri me when healthi skeptic becom widespread cynic border on alien __PUNCT__ when the peopl come to believ that govern ha becom so dysfunct that it no longer serv basic constitut end __PUNCT__ our polit have becom so polar we incap of address nation prioriti __PUNCT__ and their elect leader so devot to their person interest thei ignor the public __PUNCT__
if i privileg to serv our countri as presid __PUNCT__ i will hold my administr to standard of conduct that will strengthen rather than diminish the peopl faith in our integr __PUNCT__
i will not toler influenc peddl or self __PUNCT__ deal of ani kind __PUNCT__
no on who wish to us hi or her offic for person gain will have the privileg of hold offic in my administr __PUNCT__
i make sure that all offici in my administr have their interact with lobbyist fulli disclos to public view __PUNCT__
lobbyist have a right to petit govern on behalf of their client __PUNCT__
i never believ lobbi is an inher corrupt profess __PUNCT__
like ani profess __PUNCT__ it member includ mani peopl of sterl charact who plai a valuabl public role __PUNCT__ and a few whose qualiti ar less admir and whose purpos ar less honor __PUNCT__
we need not slander the reput of the mani by find fault in the charact of their profess rather than in the charact of the few who dishonor themselv __PUNCT__
but it is right and necessari to ensur the public right to know as well as anyon right to petit the govern __PUNCT__ to respect the abil of lobbyist to advoc their client caus as well as the need for truth disclosur __PUNCT__ to strengthen our abil to govern and the imper to keep it free from corrupt influenc __PUNCT__
in my administr __PUNCT__ public disclosur will be constant __PUNCT__ time and wide avail __PUNCT__
ethic standard will be subject to frequent review __PUNCT__
everi inspector gener in everi depart of govern will have direct access to the head of their depart and cabinet secretari __PUNCT__
and i hold those senior officehold directli respons for take the necessari correct measur to ensur the integr of the depart thei lead __PUNCT__
i will encourag congress to toughen it enforc of ethic standard __PUNCT__
i am proud to serv in congress __PUNCT__ and i know the vast major of member to be decent __PUNCT__ conscienti public servant __PUNCT__
but the few who have trade favor for person gain have shaken the public faith in the institut __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ i afraid such scandal contribut significantli to the defeat republican suffer in the last elect __PUNCT__
congress ha taken some step to address the problem __PUNCT__ but did not do enough to repair the damag done by those member who disgrac themselv and the institut __PUNCT__
much more is necessari __PUNCT__ includ the establish of an offic of public integr that move swiftli to investig complaint of ethic violat by member and their staff __PUNCT__ and it conclus should be subject to an up or down vote by all member __PUNCT__
i am a republican __PUNCT__ and i believ it is essenti to our parti success __PUNCT__ and to the nation honor that we claim sincer the mantl of reform __PUNCT__
we were elect the major in congress thirteen year ago for that reason more than ani other __PUNCT__ to reform the wai govern is fund and structur __PUNCT__ and to hold it account for it abil or inabl to address the seriou challeng of our time __PUNCT__
we lost sight of that principl __PUNCT__ and our partisanship __PUNCT__ which should be the wai in which we compet for the right to advanc our principl of smaller __PUNCT__ more effici govern __PUNCT__ becam more concern with the preserv of our power than with honor our principl __PUNCT__
we becam paralyz by the demand of compet special interest and the narrow __PUNCT__ selfish partisanship of both parti ha crippl our effort to reform govern and face squar the problem the peopl expect us to fix __PUNCT__
we need to reform and modern our transport system __PUNCT__ our energi us __PUNCT__ our public educ __PUNCT__ our tax code __PUNCT__ our health care system __PUNCT__ our telecommun law __PUNCT__ the wai we assist displac worker __PUNCT__ respond to emerg __PUNCT__ even the wai we defend our nation secur __PUNCT__
we need to balanc the feder budget and stop spend monei on thing that ar not the busi of govern __PUNCT__
we need to repair social secur and medicar now __PUNCT__ not when thei complet insolv and some unlucki gener of american is stuck with the problem __PUNCT__
none of these daunt challeng can be address without genuin and last reform __PUNCT__
it is essenti to our secur and our continu econom vitali ty __PUNCT__
and beyond provid more choic in the marketplac __PUNCT__ or a secur old ag __PUNCT__ or enhanc secur __PUNCT__ reform govern so that it meet real need with basic compet will help restor america pride in the wai we govern ourselv __PUNCT__ and remind us all __PUNCT__ those of us lucki enough to serv and those who elect us __PUNCT__ what a special thing it is to be an american __PUNCT__
last month __PUNCT__ american file their tax return __PUNCT__
the govern collect over __MONEY__ trillion in total revenu for __NUM__ __PUNCT__
do you think you ar get __MONEY__ trillion worth of valu out of washington __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i hold the agenc of the feder govern account for the monei thei spend __PUNCT__ and work with member of congress who ar seriou about reform __PUNCT__ like my friend __PUNCT__ tom coburn __PUNCT__ a man of principl who sought offic for no other purpos than to get thing done for hi countri __PUNCT__
and i make sure the public help me __PUNCT__
we go to make everi aspect of govern purchas and perform transpar __PUNCT__
inform on everi step of contract and grant will be post on the internet in plain and simpl english __PUNCT__
we not go to hide anyth behind account trick and bureaucrat doubletalk that a linguist with a phd in account couldn't deciph __PUNCT__
everi feder agenc is go to have goal set at the begin of the fiscal year __PUNCT__ and thei have to issu public progress report at the end of the year on how well or poorli thei met them __PUNCT__
we find some good perform __PUNCT__ and i be proud to recogn them __PUNCT__
but when we do not __PUNCT__ perform will determin whether thei ar fund the next year __PUNCT__
govern program will be judg for the success thei had in meet a need that peopl can't be expect to meet for themselv __PUNCT__
if program have a good record __PUNCT__ and serv a purpos that the privat sector can't __PUNCT__ thei will receiv continu fund __PUNCT__
but we not go to spend more monei on them just becaus thei have been around for a long time __PUNCT__
if thei not give american good valu for their tax dollar __PUNCT__ thei go to have to chang or thei go out of busi __PUNCT__
befor disast strike __PUNCT__ natur or man made __PUNCT__ we will make sure that clear procedur and line of commun exist between govern and privat industri to maxim respons and recoveri effort __PUNCT__
america ha mani of the best run busi in the world __PUNCT__
yet we fail to take full advantag of their know __PUNCT__ how and entrepreneuri spirit when catastroph strike __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ fedex __PUNCT__ and wal __PUNCT__ mart can tell in real time where a packag is anywher in the world __PUNCT__ but fema __PUNCT__ despit it multi __PUNCT__ billion dollar budget __PUNCT__ couldn't track mani of it asset dure it katrina respons __PUNCT__ needlessli delai help to our citizen __PUNCT__
wal __PUNCT__ mart respond more quickli to the victim of katrina than did the feder govern __PUNCT__
we need to ensur that fema adapt similar technolog and process that ar emploi by america best run compani __PUNCT__
govern __PUNCT__ run emerg oper center should includ a busi oper center to allow for proper coordin between the public and privat sector to maxim the surg of manpow __PUNCT__ equip and materi __PUNCT__
and feder law should provid suffici liabil protect to encourag more compani to act as a __PUNCT__ forc multipli __PUNCT__ for the govern dure disast respons and recoveri effort __PUNCT__
anoth respons of the feder govern that cri out for reform is how we bui the weapon system us by our militari __PUNCT__
we ar at war __PUNCT__
our servicemen and women who risk their live for us deserv a procur system that is lean __PUNCT__ agil and effici not a system that is ponder __PUNCT__ ineffect and suscept to mismanag and even corrupt __PUNCT__
everi dollar we wast on unnecessari or too costli weapon is a dollar less for the men and women who stand a post for us in harm wai __PUNCT__
problem in defens acquisit ar well known __PUNCT__ undefin or poorli defin and ever __PUNCT__ chang requir for weapon system __PUNCT__ long delai in deliveri __PUNCT__ cost overrun __PUNCT__ and a lack of account for recur failur __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ studi have identifi the same problem over and over again for mani year __PUNCT__
why ha a broken system endur for so long when everyon well awar of the problem __PUNCT__ it is the product of member of congress who ar more concern with their re __PUNCT__ elect than nation secur __PUNCT__ bureaucrat who place individu and parochi servic prioriti abov nation defens prioriti __PUNCT__ and defens contractor more concern with win the next contract than perform on the current on __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i intend do someth about that __PUNCT__
i won't toler congression earmark __PUNCT__ which have encourag not onli addit wast spend but public corrupt __PUNCT__ and led to the depress spectacl of member of congress be led off to prison __PUNCT__
nor will i allow other procur trick that divert fund from nation prioriti __PUNCT__
i will expand the us of fix price contract to enforc disciplin in the procur process and ensur that clearli defin requir ar fulfil __PUNCT__ realist schedul ar kept __PUNCT__ and cost don't exce the promis price __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ contractor underbid to __PUNCT__ bui into __PUNCT__ a market with littl expect of deliv on schedul and within budget __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ the govern cost estim ar often unrealist __PUNCT__
the navi new littor combat ship wa suppos to be a model program __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ it cost twice it project price __PUNCT__ and the navi had to cancel purchas of third ship becaus of the cost overrun __PUNCT__
fix price contract base on realist cost estim with clear __PUNCT__ consist requir will ensur that the contractor pai for cost overrun __PUNCT__ not the taxpay __PUNCT__
we must also limit sole __PUNCT__ sourc contract and make cost disciplin a prioriti us market competit to keep cost down and innov up __PUNCT__
our defens industri make the finest weapon in the world but ar not incentiv enough to keep cost down __PUNCT__
that must chang __PUNCT__
when a compani deliv the promis product and control cost __PUNCT__ it should be reward __PUNCT__
when it doesn't __PUNCT__ it must pai the price in it bottom line __PUNCT__
we must set clear expect and requir at the outset of an acquisit program __PUNCT__ and stick to the plan throughout the life of the program __PUNCT__
but we must be prepar to make tough decis __PUNCT__ decis that ar routin made in the privat sector when a product doe not meet the demand of the market __PUNCT__
we shouldn't move automat from research and develop to procur either __PUNCT__
thi critic decis should be made in a transpar process __PUNCT__ and we must be will to pull the plug befor sink more dollar into weapon that do not provid what our warrior need for the conflict of todai and tomorrow __PUNCT__
these reform and mani other will not be easi __PUNCT__ but thei ar necessari __PUNCT__
and so is reform our entir feder workforc __PUNCT__
we must streamlin our workforc __PUNCT__ demand high standard of behavior __PUNCT__ promot excel at everi level base on merit and account __PUNCT__ and not let good worker be crippl by the fine print of the latest union contract __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i will sai to the best peopl outsid washington who have proven their worth by set goal and achiev them whether it run a fortun __NUM__ compani in silicon vallei or a smaller enterpris in america heartland __PUNCT__ you have done well for yourself and your sharehold __PUNCT__ now come serv your countri __PUNCT__
i want peopl who know how to run thing __PUNCT__ effici __PUNCT__ ethic __PUNCT__ and successfulli __PUNCT__
our public and privat sector have produc thousand of men and women __PUNCT__ mani now retir __PUNCT__ who have serv their countri and their commun with distinct __PUNCT__
i want to recruit some of them for an execut search leadership group to help my administr find the right peopl for the right execut job __PUNCT__
if there a bodi armor expert in kansa citi who can help us find better and more effici wai to protect our troop or a compani execut who turn around a bloat corpor bureaucraci __PUNCT__ i want to know their name and their willing to serv __PUNCT__ not whether thei contribut to my campaign __PUNCT__
i will demand that everi resum match the qualif need to get the job done __PUNCT__
when it come to compet and integr __PUNCT__ there should be no reserv __PUNCT__ and no surpris __PUNCT__
within the next __NUM__ year over __NUM__ percent of the feder workforc will like retir __PUNCT__
thi is an opportun to reorgan the entir feder workforc __PUNCT__
we can instil in the next gener of public servant higher aspir and a greater sens of purpos __PUNCT__
i devot the necessari resourc to it __PUNCT__
we can us thi opportun to make sure that govern pai scale allow us to attract the finest public servant __PUNCT__ equip them with the newest technolog __PUNCT__ target replac judici __PUNCT__ and chang govern to make it smaller __PUNCT__ less expens __PUNCT__ better skill __PUNCT__ and more dedic to the nation interest __PUNCT__
employe in the privat sector know that if thei don't do their job right thei will lose their job __PUNCT__
competit and consequ ar the drive forc of excel __PUNCT__
taxpay deserv the same commit to excel from their employe __PUNCT__
there must be a new bargain with feder employe __PUNCT__ on that is worthi of the american peopl and mind that public servic is a privileg and a respons not a right __PUNCT__
the civil servic ha strai from it reformist root and ha mutat into a no __PUNCT__ account zone __PUNCT__ where employ is treat as an entitl __PUNCT__ good perform as an option __PUNCT__ and account as someon els problem __PUNCT__
our current system isn't fair to the mani good worker who must pick up the slack of those who aren't do their job __PUNCT__
the fail in our civil servic ar encourag by a system that make it veri difficult to fire someoneeven for gross misconduct __PUNCT__
due process should not be the alli of bad behavior __PUNCT__
we must do awai with the current system that treat feder employ as a right and make dismiss a near imposs __PUNCT__
if a feder employe is remov the decis should be review swiftli by an independ board to be sure that it not motiv by polit or person animu __PUNCT__ but it should not trigger an endless process of appeal that mock justic and account __PUNCT__
i know these reform won't be easi __PUNCT__
an entir bureaucraci ha grown comfort in it cocoon of rule and regul and is not about to chang it habit without a fight __PUNCT__
but i don't seek the presid to do the easi thing __PUNCT__
i seek it to do the right and necessari thing __PUNCT__
i not run for presid to be somebodi __PUNCT__ but to do someth __PUNCT__ to protect our countri and defeat it enemi __PUNCT__ to make the govern do it job __PUNCT__ not your job __PUNCT__ to do it better and to do it with less __PUNCT__
i have held a public trust all of my adult life __PUNCT__
i have never live a singl dai __PUNCT__ in good time and bad __PUNCT__ that i haven't thank god for the privileg __PUNCT__
america and her caus ar a bless to mankind and thei honor all of us who work to make our countri an even better place and america exampl a greater influenc on human histori __PUNCT__
it is all the reward ani of us should need __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ honor __PUNCT__ abraham lincoln said __PUNCT__ is better than honor __PUNCT__
i run for presid to make sure american have a govern that reflect the prioriti and the honor of the great nation it serv __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
