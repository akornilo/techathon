the state of our medic scienc is the envi of the world __PUNCT__
the problem is not that most american lack adequ health insur __PUNCT__
the vast major of american have privat insur and our govern spend billion each year to provid even more __PUNCT__
the biggest problem with the american health care system is that it cost too much __PUNCT__ and the wai inflationari pressur ar actual built into it __PUNCT__
busi and famili pai more and more everi year to get what thei often consid to be inadequ attent or poor care __PUNCT__
and those who want to bui insur ar often unabl to becaus of the high cost __PUNCT__
what more compel evid of the problem do we need than to note that gener motor now spend more for health care of it employe and retire than for the materi requir to manufactur it product __PUNCT__ steel __PUNCT__
the price of everi gm car includ over __MONEY__ for health care cost compar to toyota whose total cost for healthcar per car is about __MONEY__
the growth of cost affect everyon __PUNCT__ govern overspend __PUNCT__ busi cost and famili budget __PUNCT__
it hurt those who have insur by make it more expens to keep __PUNCT__
and it hurt those who don't have insur by make it even harder to attain __PUNCT__
we ar approach a __PUNCT__ perfect storm __PUNCT__ of problem that if not address by the next presid __PUNCT__ will caus our health care system to implod __PUNCT__
here is what we know __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ we current spend __NUM__ trillion dollar __PUNCT__ __NUM__ cent of everi dollar we spend __PUNCT__ on health care __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ just seven year from now __PUNCT__ that number will nearli doubl to four trillion dollar __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ medicar will be broke __PUNCT__
we ar current spend more on medicar than we ar collect in payrol tax and cash in the few iou left in the trust fund __PUNCT__
in the meantim __PUNCT__ more and more of our retire __PUNCT__ social secur check will also go to pai for medicar leav our senior with less monei for their everydai expens __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ more monei will be go out of social secur than is come in __PUNCT__
the next presid must act to avert the impend __PUNCT__ storm __PUNCT__
for all the grandios promis made in thi campaign __PUNCT__ ha ani candid spoken honestli to the american peopl about the govern role and fail about individu respons __PUNCT__ ha ani candid told the truth about the futur of medicar __PUNCT__ it cost ar grow astronom faster than it financ __PUNCT__ and leav it structur flaw unaddress will hasten it bankruptci __PUNCT__
ha ani candid warn that we have a person respons to take better care of ourselv and our children __PUNCT__ yet that is the onli wai to prevent mani chronic diseas __PUNCT__
ha ani candid insist that genuin and effect health care reform requir account from everyon __PUNCT__ drug compani __PUNCT__ insur compani __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ hospit __PUNCT__ the govern and patient __PUNCT__ yet that is the truth upon which ani so __PUNCT__ call solut must be base __PUNCT__
democrat presidenti candid ar not tell you these truth __PUNCT__
thei offer their usual default posit __PUNCT__ if the govern would onli pai for insur everyth would be fine __PUNCT__
thei promis univers coverag __PUNCT__ whatev it cost __PUNCT__ and the massiv tax increas __PUNCT__ mandat and govern regul that it impos __PUNCT__
i offer a genuin conserv vision for health care reform __PUNCT__ which preserv the most essenti valu of american live __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__
conserv believ in the pursuit of person __PUNCT__ polit and econom freedom for everyon __PUNCT__
we believ that free peopl mai voluntarili unit __PUNCT__ but cannot be compel to do so __PUNCT__ and that the limit govern that result best protect our individu freedom __PUNCT__
in health care __PUNCT__ we believ in enhanc the freedom of individu to receiv necessari and desir care __PUNCT__
we do not believ in coercion and the us of state power to mandat care __PUNCT__ coverag or cost __PUNCT__
i believ american want to be part of a system that offer high qualiti care __PUNCT__ that respect their individu digniti and is avail at reason cost __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ the american health care system as it is current structur fail thi test __PUNCT__
it is too expens __PUNCT__
it insult our common sens and digniti with excess paperwork __PUNCT__ disconnect visit with too mani specialist __PUNCT__ and by elabor hide from us ani clear idea of what we ar get for our monei __PUNCT__
we must reform the health care system to make it respons to the need of american famili __PUNCT__
not the govern __PUNCT__
not the insur compani __PUNCT__
not tort lawyer __PUNCT__
not even the doctor and hospit __PUNCT__
the next presid will have to take on the special interest that thrive in the health care system __PUNCT__
doctor must do a better job of manag our care and keep us healthi and out of hospit and nurs home __PUNCT__
we will need altern to doctor __PUNCT__ offic and emerg room __PUNCT__
hospit must do a better job of take care of us when we ar there __PUNCT__ commit far fewer deadli and costli medic error and gener oper more effici __PUNCT__
pharmaceut compani must worri less about squeez addit profit from old medicin by copi the last success drug and insist on addit patent protect and focu more on new and innov medicin __PUNCT__
insur compani should spend more on medic care and less on __PUNCT__ administr __PUNCT__
my reform ar built on the pursuit of three goal __PUNCT__ pai onli for qualiti medic care __PUNCT__ have insur choic that ar divers and respons to individu need __PUNCT__ and restor our sens of person respons __PUNCT__
these reform ar also built on the most fundament of medic tenet __PUNCT__ do no harm __PUNCT__
there is much to be admir about medicin in america __PUNCT__ and i want to protect those qualiti __PUNCT__
doctor and other provid want to provid qualiti care __PUNCT__
lower cost mean that medicar premium don't continu to spiral beyond our abil to sustain it __PUNCT__ and our insur premium ar stretch farther __PUNCT__
most importantli __PUNCT__ ani reform must respect the freedom to keep your care and insur just as thei ar __PUNCT__
the first princip of real reform is that american should pai onli for qualiti __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ too much of the system is built on get paid just for provid servic __PUNCT__ regardless of whether those servic ar necessari or produc qualiti care and outcom __PUNCT__
american famili should onli pai for get the right care __PUNCT__ care that is intend to improv their health __PUNCT__
american famili know qualiti when thei see it __PUNCT__ so their dollar should be in their hand __PUNCT__
when famili ar inform about medic choic __PUNCT__ thei ar more capabl of make their own decis __PUNCT__ less like to choos the most expens and often unnecessari option __PUNCT__ and ar more satisfi with their choic __PUNCT__
health save account ar tax __PUNCT__ prefer account us to pai insur premium and other health cost __PUNCT__
thei put the famili in charg of what thei pai for __PUNCT__ and should be expand and encourag __PUNCT__
i am commit to ensur the finest qualiti medic care for our veteran __PUNCT__
thei have earn that consider and more __PUNCT__
thei should not have to wait for access to a va facil that is hour awai __PUNCT__
we can give them the option to put the mean for financ their care under their control __PUNCT__ in an electron card or other devic __PUNCT__ so that if thei want thei can choos their care in anoth wai that suit them best __PUNCT__
we cannot let the search for high __PUNCT__ qualiti care be derail by frivol lawsuit and excess damag award __PUNCT__
we must pass medic liabil reform __PUNCT__ and those reform should elimin lawsuit for doctor that follow clinic guidelin and adher to patient safeti protocol __PUNCT__
if the democrat ar sincer in their convict that health care coverag and qualiti is their first prioriti __PUNCT__ than thei will put the need of patient befor the demand of trial lawyer __PUNCT__
but thei can't have it both wai __PUNCT__
research show that coordin care __PUNCT__ provid collabor to produc the best health outcom __PUNCT__ offer better qualiti and cost less __PUNCT__
we should pai a singl bill for high __PUNCT__ qualiti heart care __PUNCT__ not an endless seri of bill for pre __PUNCT__ surgic test and visit __PUNCT__ hospit and surgeri __PUNCT__ and follow __PUNCT__ up test __PUNCT__ drug and offic visit __PUNCT__
pai for coordin care mean that everi singl provid is now unit on be respons to the need of a singl person __PUNCT__ the patient __PUNCT__
health inform technolog will flourish becaus the market will demand it __PUNCT__
clinic __PUNCT__ hospit __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ medic technolog produc __PUNCT__ drug compani and everi other provid of health care must be account and their transact transpar __PUNCT__
famili __PUNCT__ insur compani __PUNCT__ the govern __PUNCT__ whoever is pai the bill __PUNCT__ must understand exactli what their care cost and the outcom thei receiv __PUNCT__
famili place a high valu on quickli get simpl care __PUNCT__ and have shown a willing to pai cash to get it __PUNCT__
if walk __PUNCT__ in clinic in retail outlet ar the most conveni __PUNCT__ cost __PUNCT__ effect wai for famili to safe meet simpl need why should govern stand in their wai __PUNCT__ i will not __PUNCT__
if the cheapest wai to get high qualiti care is to us advanc in web technolog to allow a doctor to practic across state line __PUNCT__ then let them __PUNCT__
in disast like katrina we saw how stupid and harm it is to refus the servic of doctor just becaus thei had an out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ state address __PUNCT__
we should have a nation market place __PUNCT__ and if i elect presid __PUNCT__ we will __PUNCT__
drug ar an import part of medicin __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ and ar often quit expens __PUNCT__
here in iowa the attornei gener is su seventi __PUNCT__ eight drug compani accus them of inflat drug cost paid by iowa taxpay through the medicaid system __PUNCT__
problem with cost ar creat when market forc ar replac by govern regul price __PUNCT__
if drug cost reflect valu __PUNCT__ fine __PUNCT__
but if there ar wai to bring greater competit to our drug market by safe re __PUNCT__ import of drug __PUNCT__ by faster introduct of gener drug __PUNCT__ or by ani other mean we should do so __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ we will __PUNCT__
govern program such as medicar and medicaid should lead the wai in health care reform that improv qualiti and lower cost __PUNCT__
like most of our system __PUNCT__ medicar reimburs now reward institut and clinician who provid more and more complex servic __PUNCT__
we need to chang the wai provid ar paid to focu their attent more on chronic diseas and manag their treatment __PUNCT__
thi is the most import care and expens for an ag popul __PUNCT__
and in a system that reward qualiti __PUNCT__ medicar should not pai for prevent medic error __PUNCT__
i am appreci of the therapeut benefit of modern pharmaceut __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ i strongli oppos ad anoth unfund entitl to the fiscal train wreck that is medicar by provid all senior with a costli drug benefit __PUNCT__ even those __PUNCT__ like me __PUNCT__ who can more than afford to pai for their medicin __PUNCT__
the second principl of effect reform is to have insur choic so vari and respons to individu need that you could fire your insur compani if you want to __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ too mani of our citizen don't have an insur polici at all __PUNCT__ and those who do ar afraid thei will lose the on thei have __PUNCT__ afraid thei will get too sick __PUNCT__ afraid to stai home and not work full __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ and afraid their benefit will disappear along with their job __PUNCT__
i believ that everyon should get a tax credit of __MONEY__ for famili __PUNCT__ if thei have health insur __PUNCT__
it is good tax polici to take awai the bia toward give worker benefit instead of wage __PUNCT__
it is good health polici to reward have insur no matter where your polici come from __PUNCT__
to us their monei effect __PUNCT__ american need more choic __PUNCT__
we should give addit help to those who face particularli expens care __PUNCT__
if it is done right and the addit monei is there __PUNCT__ insur compani will compet for these patient __PUNCT__ not turn them awai __PUNCT__
it is a challeng to develop techniqu that alloc the right amount to each of these famili __PUNCT__
i propos that we try a time __PUNCT__ honor approach and let the state work on whatev method thei find most promis __PUNCT__
the feder govern can help fund thi effort __PUNCT__ but in exchang __PUNCT__ state should allow medicaid and schip fund to be us for privat insur and develop method to augment medicaid and tax credit for more expens care __PUNCT__
famili __PUNCT__ base polici translat into broad success when thei ar pair with greater competit among insur on a level plai field __PUNCT__
you should be abl to bui your insur from ani will provid __PUNCT__ the state bureaucraci ar no better than nation on __PUNCT__
nationwid insur market that ensur broad and vigor competit will wring out excess cost __PUNCT__ overhead __PUNCT__ and bloat execut compens __PUNCT__
introduc competit into the health insur market will reduc cost __PUNCT__
some ar alreadi content with the choic and advic offer by their employ __PUNCT__
fine __PUNCT__
but american should be abl to choos who thei trust __PUNCT__
if a church or profession organ wish to sponsor insur for it member __PUNCT__ thei should be abl to do so __PUNCT__
when an american famili control it own health care financ __PUNCT__ ha a wide varieti of low __PUNCT__ cost __PUNCT__ innov choic __PUNCT__ and receiv insur through a sponsor thei trust __PUNCT__ insur polici will onli disappear when the famili decid it doesn't serv them as well as a competitor would __PUNCT__
the final import principl of reform is to rediscov our sens of person respons __PUNCT__
we must person do everyth we can to prevent expens __PUNCT__ chronic diseas __PUNCT__
our right in thi countri ar protect by our person sens of respons for our own well be __PUNCT__
case of diabet ar go up __PUNCT__ not onli in the babi boom gener __PUNCT__ but among younger american obes __PUNCT__ diabet and high blood pressur ar all on the rise __PUNCT__
parent who don't impart to their children a sens of person respons for their health __PUNCT__ nutrit and exercis __PUNCT__ vital qualiti of life inform that polit correct ha expel from our school __PUNCT__ have fail their respons __PUNCT__
also __PUNCT__ parent ar respons for ensur that their children ar cover health insur if __PUNCT__ as is often the case __PUNCT__ mani option ar alreadi avail to them __PUNCT__
we can build a health care system that is more respons to our need and is deliv to more peopl at lower cost __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ solut __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ isn't a on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit __PUNCT__ all __PUNCT__ big govern takeov of health care __PUNCT__
it resid where everi import social advanc ha alwai resid __PUNCT__ with the american peopl themselv __PUNCT__ with well inform american famili __PUNCT__ make practic decis to address their imper for better health and more secur prosper __PUNCT__
the engin of our prosper and progress ha alwai been our freedom and the sens of respons for and control of our own destini that freedom requir __PUNCT__
the public trust in govern wax and wane __PUNCT__
but we have alwai trust in ourselv to meet ani challeng that requir onli our ingenu and industri to surmount __PUNCT__
ani __PUNCT__ solut __PUNCT__ that rob us of that essenti sens of ourselv is a cure far wors than the afflict it is meant to treat __PUNCT__
