presidenti candid ar judg on their record __PUNCT__ their charact and the whole of their life experi __PUNCT__

america is at war in two countri __PUNCT__ and involv in a long and difficult fight with violent extremist who despis us __PUNCT__ our valu and modern itself __PUNCT__
it is of littl us to american for their candid to avoid the mani complex challeng of these struggl by re __PUNCT__ litig decis of the past __PUNCT__

their patienc is at an end for politician who valu ambit over principl __PUNCT__ and for partisanship that is less a contest of idea than an uncivil brawl over the spoil of power __PUNCT__
