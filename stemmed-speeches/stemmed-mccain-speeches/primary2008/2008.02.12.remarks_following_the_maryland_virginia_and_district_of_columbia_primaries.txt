and thank you __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ for your support and all your hard work __PUNCT__
we have come a long wai in thi campaign __PUNCT__ and we have had our up and down __PUNCT__

without your faith and commit we would not be here __PUNCT__ and i am immens grate to you __PUNCT__
but now come the hard part __PUNCT__ and for america __PUNCT__ the much bigger decis __PUNCT__
we do not yet know for certain who will have the honor of be the democrat parti nomine for presid __PUNCT__
but we know where either of their candid will lead thi countri __PUNCT__ and we dare not let them __PUNCT__
thei will promis a new approach to govern __PUNCT__ but offer onli the polici of a polit orthodoxi that insist the solut to govern failur is to simpli make it bigger __PUNCT__
thei will appeal to our dream of a better futur for ourselv __PUNCT__ our famili and our countri __PUNCT__ but thei would take from us more of the wealth we have earn to build those dream and assur us that govern is better abl than we ar to make decis about our futur for us __PUNCT__
thei will promis to break with the fail polit of the past __PUNCT__ but will campaign in wai that seek to minim their exposur to question from the press and challeng from voter who ask more from their candid than an empti promis of __PUNCT__ trust me __PUNCT__ i know better __PUNCT__
thei will paint a pictur of the world in which america mistak ar a greater threat to our secur than the malevol intent of an enemi that despis us and our ideal __PUNCT__ a world that can be made safer and more peac by placat our implac foe and break faith with alli and the million of peopl in thi world for whom america __PUNCT__ and the global progress of our ideal __PUNCT__ ha long been __PUNCT__ the last __PUNCT__ best hope of earth __PUNCT__
we will offer differ idea __PUNCT__ base in a better understand of the challeng we face __PUNCT__ and the resolv to confront them with confid in the strength and ideal of free peopl __PUNCT__
we believ that american __PUNCT__ not our detractor and certainli not our enemi __PUNCT__ ar on the right side of histori __PUNCT__
we trust in the strength __PUNCT__ industri and good of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we don't believ that govern ha all the answer __PUNCT__
we believ that govern must respect the right __PUNCT__ properti and opportun of the peopl to whom we ar account __PUNCT__
we don't believ in grow the size of govern to make it easier to serv our own ambit __PUNCT__
we believ that what govern is expect to do __PUNCT__ what we cannot do for ourselv individu __PUNCT__ it must do with compet __PUNCT__ resolv and wisdom __PUNCT__
the american peopl don't send us to washington to serv our self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__ but to serv their __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to fight each other for our own polit ambit __PUNCT__ but to fight togeth our real enemi __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to washington to stroke our ego __PUNCT__ but to help them keep thi beauti __PUNCT__ bounti __PUNCT__ bless countri safe __PUNCT__ prosper __PUNCT__ proud and free __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to washington to take more of their monei __PUNCT__ and wast it on thing that add not an ounc to america strength and prosper __PUNCT__ that don't help a singl famili realiz the dream we all dream for our children __PUNCT__ that don't help a singl displac worker find a new job __PUNCT__ and the secur and digniti it assur them __PUNCT__ that won't keep the promis we make to young worker that the retir thei have begun to invest in __PUNCT__ will be there for them when thei need it __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to washington to do their job __PUNCT__ but to do our __PUNCT__ to do it better and with less of their monei __PUNCT__
the work we face in our time is great __PUNCT__ but our opportun greater still __PUNCT__
in a time of war __PUNCT__ and the terribl sacrific it entail __PUNCT__ the promis of a better futur is not alwai clear __PUNCT__
but i promis you __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ we face no enemi __PUNCT__ no matter how cruel __PUNCT__ and no challeng __PUNCT__ no matter how daunt __PUNCT__ greater than the courag __PUNCT__ patriot and determin of american __PUNCT__
we ar the maker of histori __PUNCT__ not it victim __PUNCT__
hope __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is a power thing __PUNCT__
i can attest to that better than mani __PUNCT__ for i have seen men hope test in hard and cruel wai that few will ever experi __PUNCT__
and i stood astonish at the resili of their hope in the darkest of hour becaus it did not resid in an exagger belief in their individu strength __PUNCT__ but in the support of their comrad __PUNCT__ and their faith in their countri __PUNCT__
my hope for our countri resid in my faith in the american charact __PUNCT__ the charact which proudli defend the right to think and do for ourselv __PUNCT__ but perceiv self __PUNCT__ interest in accord with a kinship of ideal __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ when call upon __PUNCT__ american will defend with their veri live __PUNCT__
to encourag a countri with onli rhetor rather than sound and proven idea that trust in the strength and courag of free peopl is not a promis of hope __PUNCT__
it is a platitud __PUNCT__
when i wa a young man __PUNCT__ i thought glori wa the highest ambit __PUNCT__ and that all glori wa self __PUNCT__ glori __PUNCT__
my parent tri to teach me otherwis __PUNCT__ as did the naval academi __PUNCT__
but i didn't understand the lesson until later in life __PUNCT__ when i confront challeng i never expect to face __PUNCT__
in that confront i discov that i wa depend on other to a greater extent than i had ever realiz __PUNCT__ but that neither thei nor the caus we serv made ani claim on my ident __PUNCT__
on the contrari __PUNCT__ i discov that noth is more liber in life than to fight for a caus that encompass you __PUNCT__ but is not defin by your exist alon __PUNCT__
and that ha made all the differ __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ all the differ in the world __PUNCT__
i do not seek the presid on the presumpt that i am bless with such person great that histori ha anoint me to save my countri in it hour of need __PUNCT__
i seek the presid with the humil of a man who cannot forget that my countri save me __PUNCT__
i am run to serv america __PUNCT__ and to champion the idea i believ will help us do what everi american gener ha manag to do __PUNCT__ to make in our time __PUNCT__ and from our challeng __PUNCT__ a stronger countri and a better world __PUNCT__
i intend to do that by fight for the principl and polici i believ best serv the interest of the american peopl __PUNCT__ for a govern that take and spend less of your monei and compet discharg it respons __PUNCT__ that show a proper respect for our right and valu __PUNCT__ that provid a strong and capabl defens __PUNCT__ that encourag the enterpris and ingenu of individu __PUNCT__ busi and famili __PUNCT__ who know best how to advanc america economi __PUNCT__ and secur the dream that have made us the greatest nation in histori __PUNCT__
as i have done my entir career __PUNCT__ i will make my case to everi american who will listen __PUNCT__
i will not confin myself to the comfort of speak onli to those who agre with me __PUNCT__
i will make my case to all the peopl __PUNCT__
i will listen to those who disagre __PUNCT__
i will attempt to persuad them __PUNCT__
i will debat __PUNCT__
and i will learn from them __PUNCT__
but i will fight everi moment of everi dai for what i believ is right for thi countri __PUNCT__ and i will not yield __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ i am fire up and readi to go __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and god bless you __PUNCT__
