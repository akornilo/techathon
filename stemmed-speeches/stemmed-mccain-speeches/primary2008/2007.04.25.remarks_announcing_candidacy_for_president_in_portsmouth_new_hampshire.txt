we begun anoth campaign season earlier than mani american prefer __PUNCT__
so soon after our last contenti elect __PUNCT__ our differ ar again sure to be sharpen and exagger __PUNCT__
that the natur of free elect __PUNCT__
but even in the heat of a campaign __PUNCT__ we shouldn't lose sight that much more defin us than our partisanship __PUNCT__ much more unit us than divid us __PUNCT__
we have common purpos and common challeng __PUNCT__ and we live in moment time __PUNCT__
thi elect should be about big thing __PUNCT__ not small on __PUNCT__
our ar not red state or blue state problem __PUNCT__
thei ar nation and global __PUNCT__
half measur and small mind polit ar inadequ to the present occas __PUNCT__
we can't muddl through the next four year __PUNCT__ bicker among ourselv __PUNCT__ and leav to other the work that is our to do __PUNCT__
great is america destini __PUNCT__ but no nation complac in it great can long sustain it __PUNCT__
we ar fight a war in two countri __PUNCT__ and we in a global struggl with violent extremist who despis us __PUNCT__ our valu and modern itself __PUNCT__
if we ar to succe __PUNCT__ we must rethink and rebuild the structur and mission of our militari __PUNCT__ the capabl of our intellig and law enforc agenc __PUNCT__ the purpos of our allianc __PUNCT__ the reach and scope of our diplomaci __PUNCT__ the capac of all branch of govern to defend us __PUNCT__
we need to marshal all element of american power __PUNCT__ our militari __PUNCT__ economi __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ trade and technolog __PUNCT__
we need to strengthen our allianc and build support in other nation __PUNCT__
we must preserv our moral credibl __PUNCT__ and rememb that our secur and the global progress of our ideal ar inextric link __PUNCT__
we all know the war in iraq ha not gone well __PUNCT__
we have made mistak and we have paid grievous for them __PUNCT__
we have chang the strategi that fail us __PUNCT__ and we have begun to make a littl progress __PUNCT__
but in the mani mistak we have made in thi war __PUNCT__ a few lesson have becom clear __PUNCT__
america should never undertak a war unless we ar prepar to do everyth necessari to succe __PUNCT__ unless we have a realist and comprehens plan for success __PUNCT__ and unless all relev agenc of govern ar commit to that success __PUNCT__
we did not meet thi respons initi __PUNCT__
and we must never repeat that mistak again __PUNCT__
we must also prepar __PUNCT__ far better than we have __PUNCT__ to respond quickli and effect to anoth terrorist attack or natur calam __PUNCT__
when american confront a catastroph __PUNCT__ natur or man __PUNCT__ made __PUNCT__ thei have a right to expect basic compet from their govern __PUNCT__
thei won't accept that firemen and policemen ar unabl to commun with each other in an emerg becaus thei don't have the same radio frequenc __PUNCT__
thei won't accept govern failur to deliv bottl water to dehydr babi or rescu the infirm from a hospit with no electr __PUNCT__
thei won't accept substandard care and indiffer for wound veteran __PUNCT__
that not good enough for america __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ it won't be good enough for me __PUNCT__
govern spend more monei todai than ever befor __PUNCT__
wast spend on thing that ar not the busi of govern indebt us to other nation __PUNCT__ depriv you of the fruit of your labor __PUNCT__ fuel inflat __PUNCT__ rais interest rate __PUNCT__ and encourag irrespons __PUNCT__
that not good enough for america __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ it won't be good enough for me __PUNCT__
no govern program is the object of more polit postur than social secur and medicar __PUNCT__
here the plain truth __PUNCT__ there ar too few worker support too mani retire __PUNCT__ and if we don't make some tough choic todai __PUNCT__ social secur and medicar will go bankrupt or we have to rais tax so drastic we crush the prosper of averag american __PUNCT__
too mani politician want to ignor the problem __PUNCT__ and run for re __PUNCT__ elect by threaten anyon who want to fix it __PUNCT__
that not good enough for america __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ it won't be good enough for me __PUNCT__
our tax code is us to game the system for some at the expens of the mani instead of encourag the thrift __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ innov and industri of all american __PUNCT__
it complex and wast cost american __MONEY__ billion in prepar and complianc cost each year __PUNCT__
that not good enough for america __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ it won't be good enough for me __PUNCT__
our depend on foreign sourc of energi not onli harm our environ and economi __PUNCT__ it endang our secur __PUNCT__
so much of the oil we import come from countri in volatil region of the world where our valu aren't share and our interest aren't a prioriti __PUNCT__
that not good enough for america __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ it won't be good enough for me __PUNCT__
we not a countri that prefer nostalgia to optim __PUNCT__
we not a countri that would rather go back than forward __PUNCT__
we the world leader __PUNCT__ and leader don't pine for the past and dread the futur __PUNCT__
we make the futur better than the past __PUNCT__
open new market to american good and servic is indispens to our futur prosper __PUNCT__
lower trade barrier creat more and better job __PUNCT__ keep inflat under control __PUNCT__ keep interest rate low __PUNCT__ and make more good afford to more american __PUNCT__
we won't compet successfulli by us old technolog to produc old good __PUNCT__
we succe by know what to produc and invent new technolog to produc it __PUNCT__
but open market don't automat translat into a better qualiti of life for everi american __PUNCT__
while most gain __PUNCT__ some ar forc to struggl with veri difficult choic __PUNCT__
right now we have a half dozen program to help displac worker and anoth half dozen for peopl who aren't work at all __PUNCT__

these ar some of the challeng that confront us __PUNCT__
there ar other just as urgent __PUNCT__ and dure thi campaign i travel across the countri offer my idea about how we should address them and listen to the concern and advic of american __PUNCT__
the american peopl aren't interest in an elect that offer platitud instead of principl and insult instead of idea __PUNCT__ an elect that result __PUNCT__ no matter who win __PUNCT__ in four year of unkept promis and a divid govern that is littl more than a battleground for the next elect __PUNCT__
thei tire of the old polit __PUNCT__
american ar acut awar of our problem __PUNCT__ and their patienc is at an end for politician who valu incumb over principl __PUNCT__ and for partisanship that is less a contest of idea than an uncivil brawl over the spoil of power __PUNCT__
