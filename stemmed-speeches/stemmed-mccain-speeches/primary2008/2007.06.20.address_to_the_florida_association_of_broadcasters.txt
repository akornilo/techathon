the countri of latin america ar the natur partner of the unit state __PUNCT__ and yet it hardli feel that wai todai __PUNCT__
anti __PUNCT__ american is on the rise in much of the region __PUNCT__
the attent of u. __PUNCT__ leader and the media have shift toward iraq __PUNCT__ afghanistan __PUNCT__ the broader middl east and the war on terror __PUNCT__
as we have devot attent and energi to other region __PUNCT__ other __PUNCT__ danger forc have move into the breach __PUNCT__

while the unit state ha been pre __PUNCT__ occupi elsewher __PUNCT__ china ha launch a diplomat and econom offens in the region __PUNCT__ with uncertain intent and outcom __PUNCT__
and there is a grow reject among some latin amer ican of the free __PUNCT__ market democraci that ha been so painfulli achiev __PUNCT__

i have seen the difficult journei thi region ha made sinc the 1970 and 80 __PUNCT__ a time of war and dictatorship __PUNCT__ of hyperinfl and econom stagnat __PUNCT__

if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ the unit state will forg a new polici toward latin america and the caribbean basin found on peac and secur __PUNCT__ share prosper __PUNCT__ democraci and freedom __PUNCT__ and mutual respect __PUNCT__
there ar sever area of concern __PUNCT__

trinidad is home to a radic islam group that ha been implic in the recent plot to attack new york jfk airport __PUNCT__ and sever individu involv in that plot ar from guyana __PUNCT__
our secur prioriti in thi hemispher is to ensur that terrorist __PUNCT__ their enabl and their busi partner __PUNCT__ includ narcotraffick __PUNCT__ have nowher to hide __PUNCT__
