fortun __PUNCT__ thi man __PUNCT__ governor reagan __PUNCT__ becam presid reagan __PUNCT__
how differ would our live be had he not won elect in __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ doe anyon believ a liber democrat presid would have call the soviet union an __PUNCT__ evil empir __PUNCT__ or would have stood up to the nuclear freez movement __PUNCT__ can you imagin a liber democrat presid sai commun should be left on the ash heap of histori __PUNCT__ or call on gorbachev to tear down the berlin wall __PUNCT__ while mani democrat tri to defund weapon system and freedom fighter __PUNCT__ ronald reagan wa steadfast __PUNCT__ and he wa right __PUNCT__
thank to hi leadership __PUNCT__ the soviet union dissolv and the cold war wa won on our term __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the challeng ar at least as sever as thei were when ronald reagan stood tall __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ the differ between republican and democrat on nation secur ar everi bit as stark as thei were __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ lead democrat presidenti candid vote against fund for our troop engag in war in afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ lead democrat presidenti candid question whether there is a war on terror __PUNCT__ offer to enter into uncondit negoti with our worst enemi __PUNCT__ and talk about counter the forc of radic by advoc surrend to them in iraq __PUNCT__
if the democrat get their wai in iraq __PUNCT__ if we cede iraq to al qaeda __PUNCT__ how long will thei stai the cours in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we face grave challeng in the middl east __PUNCT__ halt iran nuclear ambit __PUNCT__ protect our democrat alli __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__ support moder voic against the killer of hama and hezbollah __PUNCT__ defend lebanon sovereignti against syrian and iranian aggress __PUNCT__
doe anyon serious believ that we can better meet those challeng in the aftermath of an american defeat in iraq __PUNCT__ it is irrespons to think so __PUNCT__ and ani man or woman who doe isn't prepar to lead our countri in the struggl against islam extrem __PUNCT__
the world ronald regan face wa a danger on __PUNCT__ but more stabl than the world todai __PUNCT__
it wa a world where we confront a massiv __PUNCT__ organ threat to our secur __PUNCT__
our enemi wa evil __PUNCT__ but not irrat __PUNCT__
and for all the suffer endur by captiv nation __PUNCT__ for all the fear of global nuclear war __PUNCT__ it wa a world made fairli predict by a stabl balanc of power until our steadfast and patienc yield an histor victori for our secur and ideal __PUNCT__
that world is gone __PUNCT__ and pleas don't mistak my reminisc as an indic that i miss it __PUNCT__
if i nostalg for it at all __PUNCT__ it is onli an old man nostalgia for the time when he misspent hi youth __PUNCT__
that world __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ had much cruelti and terror __PUNCT__ some of which it wa my fate to wit person __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we glimps the prospect of anoth __PUNCT__ better world __PUNCT__ in which all peopl might somedai share in the bless and respons of freedom __PUNCT__
but we also face a threat __PUNCT__ and a long war to defeat it __PUNCT__ that is as difficult and in mani respect more destabil than ani challeng we have ever face __PUNCT__
we confront an enemi that so despis us and modern itself that thei would us ani mean __PUNCT__ unleash ani terror __PUNCT__ caus the most unimagin suffer to harm us __PUNCT__ and to destroi the world we have tri throughout our histori to build __PUNCT__
as we meet here todai __PUNCT__ in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ american soldier __PUNCT__ marin __PUNCT__ sailor and airmen ar fight brave and tenaci in battl that ar as danger __PUNCT__ difficult and consequenti as the great battl of our arm forc __PUNCT__ stori past __PUNCT__
as we all know __PUNCT__ the war in iraq ha not gone well __PUNCT__ and the american peopl have grown sick and tire of it __PUNCT__
i understand that __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ have been made sick at heart by the mani mistak made by civilian and militari command and the terribl price we have paid for them __PUNCT__
but we cannot react to these mistak by embrac a cours of action that will be an even greater mistak __PUNCT__ a mistak of coloss histor proport __PUNCT__ which will and i am as sure of thi as i am of anyth serious endang the countri i have serv all my adult life __PUNCT__
like you __PUNCT__ i want our troop to come home __PUNCT__ but i want them to come home with honor __PUNCT__
the honor of victori that is due all of those who have paid with the ultim sacrific so that sacrific is not in vain __PUNCT__
we have new command in iraq __PUNCT__ and thei ar follow a counterinsurg strategi that i have call for from the begin __PUNCT__ which make the most effect us of our strength and doesn't strengthen the tactic of our enemi __PUNCT__
thi new battl plan is succeed where our previou tactic fail __PUNCT__
although the outcom remain uncertain __PUNCT__ we must give gener petraeu and the american he ha the honor to command adequ time to salvag from the wreckag of our past mistak a measur of stabil for iraq and the middl east __PUNCT__ and a more secur futur for the american peopl __PUNCT__
to conced defeat __PUNCT__ as mani lead democrat now advoc __PUNCT__ would strengthen al qaeda __PUNCT__ empow iran and other hostil power in the middl east __PUNCT__ unleash a full scale civil war in iraq that could quit possibl provok genocid there __PUNCT__ and destabil the entir region as neighbor power come to the aid of their favor faction __PUNCT__
the consequ would threaten us for year __PUNCT__ and i am certain would eventu draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would impos even greater sacrific on us __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ choos to lose in iraq would hand a victori to the radic in control of iran __PUNCT__
as iran presid recent crow __PUNCT__ soon __PUNCT__ we will see a huge power vacuum in the region __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ we ar prepar to fill the gap __PUNCT__
iran ha been engag in a proxi war against our forc in iraq for year __PUNCT__
thei ar activ arm sunni and shia radic with advanc weapon and on the ground train __PUNCT__
twenti seven year ago __PUNCT__ the radic mullah in iran releas american hostag held illeg for more than __NUM__ dai rather than face presid reagan __PUNCT__
it wa the first victori of hi presid and we should heed the lesson it hold for deal with iran todai __PUNCT__ determin and resolv __PUNCT__ not accommod and appeas __PUNCT__ ar what tehran heed __PUNCT__
and i certainli think a man who is direct the maim and kill of american troop should not be given an invit to speak at an american univers __PUNCT__
rather than roll out the red carpet for the leader of a terrorist __PUNCT__ sponsor regim __PUNCT__ columbia should be welcom the reserv offic __PUNCT__ train corp back on campu to honor the men and women who put their live on the line everi dai defend our freedom __PUNCT__
ronald reagan warn of the need for firm and vigil in the 1970 __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we did not heed hi wisdom and we paid a horribl price for weak and inattent toward the threat pose by islam extrem in the 1990 __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ our defeat in iraq would be even more catastroph __PUNCT__ not just for iraq __PUNCT__ but for us __PUNCT__ and i cannot and will not be complicit in it __PUNCT__
i will do whatev i can to help avert it __PUNCT__
that is all i can offer my countri __PUNCT__
it is not much compar to the sacrific made by american who have volunt to shoulder a rifl and fight thi war for us __PUNCT__
i know that and am humbl by it __PUNCT__
but though my duti is neither danger nor oner __PUNCT__ it compel me nonetheless to sai to my fellow american __PUNCT__ as long as we have a chanc to succe we must try to succe __PUNCT__
and i believ that if we persever we can succe on the battlefield of iraq and in the larger war against islam extrem __PUNCT__
i have mani respons to the american peopl __PUNCT__ and i try to take them all serious __PUNCT__
but i have on respons that outweigh all the other and that is to us whatev meager talent i possess __PUNCT__ and everi resourc god ha grant me to protect the secur of thi great and good nation from all enemi foreign and domest __PUNCT__
and that i intend to do __PUNCT__ even if i must stand athwart popular opinion __PUNCT__
i will attempt to convinc as mani of my countrymen as i can that we must show even greater patienc __PUNCT__ though our patienc is nearli exhaust __PUNCT__ and that as long as there is a prospect for not lose thi war then we must not choos to lose it __PUNCT__
that is how i constru my respons to my countri __PUNCT__
that is how i constru it yesterdai __PUNCT__
it is how i constru it todai __PUNCT__
it is how i will constru it tomorrow __PUNCT__
i do not know how i could choos ani other cours __PUNCT__
war is a terribl thing __PUNCT__ but not the worst thing __PUNCT__
our militari men and women have endur the danger and depriv of war so that the worst thing would not befal us __PUNCT__ so that america might be secur in her freedom __PUNCT__
the war in iraq ha divid the american peopl __PUNCT__ but it ha divid no american in our admir for the men and women who ar fight for us there __PUNCT__
it is everi veteran hope that should their children be call upon to answer a call to arm __PUNCT__ the battl will be necessari and the field well chosen __PUNCT__
but that is not their respons __PUNCT__
it belong to the govern that call them __PUNCT__
as it onc wa for us __PUNCT__ their honor will be in their answer not their summon __PUNCT__
whatev we think about how and why we went to war in iraq __PUNCT__ we ar all __PUNCT__ those who support the decis that place them in harm wai and those who oppos it __PUNCT__ humbl by and grate for their exampl __PUNCT__
thei now deserv the distinct of the best american __PUNCT__ and we ow them a debt we can never fulli repai __PUNCT__
we can onli offer the small tribut of our humil and our commit to do all that we can do __PUNCT__ in less try and costli circumst __PUNCT__ to help keep thi nation worthi of their sacrific for us and for the world __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ ronald reagan gave hi famou __PUNCT__ shine citi upon a hill __PUNCT__ speech and conclud by sai __PUNCT__ we cannot escap our destini __PUNCT__ nor should we try to do so __PUNCT__
the leadership of the free world wa thrust upon us in the littl hall of philadelphia __PUNCT__
in the dai follow world war ii __PUNCT__ when the econom strength and power of america wa all the stood between the world and the return to the dark ag __PUNCT__ pope piu xii said __PUNCT__ the american peopl have a great geniu for splendid and unselfish action __PUNCT__
into the hand of america __PUNCT__ god ha place the destini of an afflict mankind __PUNCT__
we ar inde __PUNCT__ and we ar todai __PUNCT__ the last best hope of man on earth __PUNCT__
it wa my privileg to hear governor reagan deliv that speech __PUNCT__
i had recent been releas from a long involuntari captiv and wa seat as governor reagan guest __PUNCT__
hi word ring true todai when __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ it fall to america to lead the world against a global threat __PUNCT__ to remain the last best hope of man on earth __PUNCT__
it is a privileg beyond measur to live in a countri that ha sacrif so much for the caus of freedom __PUNCT__
i have live a long __PUNCT__ event and bless life __PUNCT__
i have had the good fortun to know person a great mani brave and selfless patriot who sacrif and shed blood to defend america __PUNCT__
but i have known none braver or better than those who do so todai __PUNCT__
