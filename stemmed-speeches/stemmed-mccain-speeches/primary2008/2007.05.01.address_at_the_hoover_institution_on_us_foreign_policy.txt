thei kept faith with the etern principl of our declar of independ against the evil of despot __PUNCT__ fascism __PUNCT__ and totalitarian __PUNCT__
and thei chang the world __PUNCT__
democraci wa born and then spread across the globe __PUNCT__ from north america to europ to asia and latin america __PUNCT__ to africa and the middl east __PUNCT__
todai we stand __PUNCT__ grate __PUNCT__ on thi foundat of freedom __PUNCT__
now it is our gener turn to build __PUNCT__
it is our gener turn to restor and replenish the faith in our nation and our principl __PUNCT__
we have suffer terribl attack at the hand of a new enemi that relentlessli seek our destruct __PUNCT__
new danger have arisen __PUNCT__ great power ar emerg and seek to shift the intern balanc of power __PUNCT__ and we ar in the midst of two war whose outcom will shape our futur __PUNCT__
here at home there is discord and doubt __PUNCT__ and our famou optim as a peopl ha begun to flicker __PUNCT__
it must not __PUNCT__
ever sinc jamestown __PUNCT__ we have displai courag in the face of advers __PUNCT__
we ar a hardi __PUNCT__ spirit and steadfast peopl __PUNCT__ a nation of pioneer and inveter problem solver __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ america remain the most attract of nation __PUNCT__ where peopl the world over wish to visit __PUNCT__ studi __PUNCT__ live __PUNCT__ start busi __PUNCT__ invest and look for inspir in our valu and our freedom __PUNCT__
that is why i believ we ar about to enter our greatest and proudest year as a nation __PUNCT__
our great presid __PUNCT__ harri truman onc said of america __PUNCT__ god ha creat us and brought us to our present posit of power and strength for some great purpos __PUNCT__
in hi time __PUNCT__ that great purpos wa to erect structur of peac and prosper that could provid safe passag through the cold war __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we face new danger and new opportun and we must have a new common mission __PUNCT__ to build an endur global peac __PUNCT__ and to build it upon the foundat of freedom __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ prosper and hope __PUNCT__
there is so much promis in todai world __PUNCT__
we live in an era of unpreced human progress __PUNCT__
an increasingli global commerc is spread a better and freer life to million __PUNCT__
our scientist and physician ar erad diseas that onc ravag popul __PUNCT__
more peopl live under democraci than at ani time in human histori __PUNCT__
more than ever befor __PUNCT__ a father and mother can pass on to their children a happier __PUNCT__ healthier __PUNCT__ longer __PUNCT__ and freer life than thei themselv knew __PUNCT__
yet as we seiz and expand these opportun __PUNCT__ we must recogn the danger pose by the forc of terror and tyranni that look backward into a world of dark and violenc __PUNCT__
with our democrat friend and alli around the world __PUNCT__ we need to build a new global order of peac __PUNCT__ a peac that can last not just for a decad but for a centuri __PUNCT__ where the danger and threat we face diminish __PUNCT__ and where human progress reach new height __PUNCT__
almost two centuri ago jame madison declar that the great struggl of the epoch __PUNCT__ wa between liberti and despot __PUNCT__
mani thought that thi struggl end with the cold war __PUNCT__ but it didn't __PUNCT__
it took on new guis __PUNCT__ such as the modern terrorist network __PUNCT__ an enemi of progress that ha turn our technolog advanc to it own us __PUNCT__ and in ruler try to rebuild __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri autocraci in a __NUM__ centuri world __PUNCT__
todai the talk is of the war on terror __PUNCT__ a war in which we must succe __PUNCT__
but the war on terror cannot be the onli organ principl of american foreign polici __PUNCT__
intern terrorist capabl of inflict mass destruct ar a new phenomenon __PUNCT__
but what thei seek and what thei stand for ar as old as time __PUNCT__
thei compris part of worldwid polit __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ and philosoph struggl between the futur and the past __PUNCT__ between progress and reaction __PUNCT__ and between liberti and despot __PUNCT__
upon the outco me of that struggl depend our secur __PUNCT__ our prosper __PUNCT__ and our democrat wai of life __PUNCT__
democraci and freedom continu to flourish around the world __PUNCT__ but there have been some discourag trend __PUNCT__
in china __PUNCT__ despit miracul econom growth and a higher standard of live for mani million of chines __PUNCT__ hope for an accompani polit reform have diminish __PUNCT__
the rule parti seem determin to domin polit life __PUNCT__ and as in the past __PUNCT__ the talk is of order __PUNCT__ not democraci __PUNCT__ the supremaci of the parti not of the peopl __PUNCT__
china astonish the world with it econom and technolog modern __PUNCT__ but then spend billion try to control that great icon of the modern era __PUNCT__ the internet __PUNCT__
china recogn it vital interest in econom integr with the democrat world __PUNCT__
but it ha also join russia in hinder intern effort to put pressur on dictat in iran __PUNCT__ sudan __PUNCT__ zimbabw __PUNCT__ burma __PUNCT__ and other pariah state __PUNCT__
china express it desir for a stabl peac in east asia __PUNCT__ but it contin ue to increas it militari might __PUNCT__ foster distrust and concern in the region about beij ambit __PUNCT__
we must insist that china us it newfound power respons at home and abroad __PUNCT__
a decad ago __PUNCT__ the great russian peopl had thrown off communist tyranni and seem determin to build democraci and a free market and to join the west __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ russia look more and more like some __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri autocraci __PUNCT__ mark by diminish polit freedom __PUNCT__ shadowi intrigu __PUNCT__ and mysteri assassin __PUNCT__
beyond it border moscow ha tri to expand it influenc over it neighbor in eastern __PUNCT__ central and even western europ __PUNCT__
while the more democrat russia of the 1990 sought to deepen it ti with europ and america __PUNCT__ todai a more authoritarian moscow manipul europ depend on russian oil and ga to compel silenc and obedi __PUNCT__ and to try to drive a wedg between europ and the unit state __PUNCT__
the russian govern is even more brutal toward the young democraci on it peripheri __PUNCT__ threaten them with trade embargo and wors if thei move too close to the west __PUNCT__
it support separatist mov ement in georgia and moldova and openli interven in ukrain presidenti elect __PUNCT__
and it is suppli weapon to iran __PUNCT__ syria __PUNCT__ and indirectli to hezbollah __PUNCT__
but if some in russia yearn to turn the clock back two decad __PUNCT__ the zealot of islam radic would turn it back centuri __PUNCT__
the mullah of iran and the leader of al qaeda and hezbollah want to cleans the muslim world of modern and the ideal of the enlighten __PUNCT__ and return it to an imagin past of theolog puriti __PUNCT__
thei state their goal plainli __PUNCT__ a univers islam theocraci __PUNCT__ a new caliph across all the land onc domin by islam __PUNCT__ includ the land held in europ centuri ago __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ mideast autocraci fuel thi radic by deni their peopl polit express __PUNCT__ econom opportun or hope for a better futur __PUNCT__
these govern differ from on anoth in a thousand wai __PUNCT__ and our polici toward them must reflect those differ __PUNCT__
our nation interest requir that we pursu econom and strateg cooper with china and russia __PUNCT__ that we support egypt and saudi arabia role as peacemak in the middl east __PUNCT__ and that we work with pakistan to fight the taliban and al qaeda __PUNCT__
but our nation interest also requir that we continu press for progress __PUNCT__
we have seen how autocrat govern often work against our interest __PUNCT__
iran is abl to aggress pursu nuclear weapon and hegemoni in the persian gulf __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ becaus it ha been shield by the world power autocraci __PUNCT__
north korea defi the intern commun with it nuclear weapon and missil program and an obscen human right record __PUNCT__
last month __PUNCT__ north korea unsurprisingli miss the first deadlin in the most recent nuclear agreement and it remain to be seen if china will us it enorm influenc to demand better behavior __PUNCT__
the path to an endur peac li in a clear __PUNCT__ ei pursuit of our nation interest that doe not acced to autocrat trend __PUNCT__
we must expand the power and reach of democraci __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ and human right us our mani strength as a free peopl __PUNCT__
but that mean make some substanti chang in how we do busi __PUNCT__
chang must begin at home __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ just a year into the cold war __PUNCT__ the truman administr launch a massiv overhaul of the nation foreign polici __PUNCT__ defens __PUNCT__ and intellig agenc to meet new challeng __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we must do the same to meet the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
i will have much more to sai about thi in the futur but our need ar clear in the organ __PUNCT__ skill __PUNCT__ and capabl need to prevail in the conflict with violent extremist __PUNCT__ an intellig commun that is abl to collect and analyz inform on and conduct oper against our enemi __PUNCT__ a public diplomaci effort that make our case to the world effect __PUNCT__ a diplomat corp that understand stabil doe not mean support dictatorship __PUNCT__ foreign aid program that foster good govern __PUNCT__ gener that understand and learn from past war and appli those lesson to the futur __PUNCT__ defens procur that is transpar __PUNCT__ account and e ffectiv __PUNCT__ and civilian defens leadership that is held account for result and provid the resourc necessari to achiev result __PUNCT__
we must never again launch a militari oper with too few troop to complet the mission and build a secur __PUNCT__ stabl __PUNCT__ and democrat peac __PUNCT__
when we fight a war __PUNCT__ we must fight to win __PUNCT__
we cannot build an endur peac base on freedom by ourselv __PUNCT__
nor do we want to __PUNCT__
the declar of independ proclaim our duti to pai decent respect to the opinion of mankind __PUNCT__
when i think back to the 1980 __PUNCT__ the decad of triumph in the cold war __PUNCT__ i think about our great allianc __PUNCT__
reagan __PUNCT__ thatcher __PUNCT__ kohl __PUNCT__ mitterrand __PUNCT__ nakason thei were all strong leader who jealous guard the interest of their peopl __PUNCT__
but thei link arm against communist tyranni __PUNCT__
todai we need to reviv that vital democrat solidar __PUNCT__
we need to renew the term of our partnership and strike a new grand bargain for the futur __PUNCT__
we american must be will to listen to the view and respect the collect will of our democrat alli __PUNCT__
like all other nation __PUNCT__ we reserv the sovereign right to defend our vital nation secur when and how we deem necessari __PUNCT__
but our great power doe not mean we can do whatev we want whenev we want __PUNCT__ nor should we assum we have all the wisdom __PUNCT__ knowledg and resourc necessari to succe __PUNCT__
when we believ intern action is necessari __PUNCT__ whether militari __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ or diplomat __PUNCT__ we must work to persuad our democrat friend and alli that we ar right __PUNCT__
but in return __PUNCT__ we must be will to be persuad by them __PUNCT__
to be a good leader __PUNCT__ america must be a good alli __PUNCT__
our partner must be good alli __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
thei must have the will and the abil to act in the common defens of freedom __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ and econom prosper __PUNCT__
thei must spend the monei necessari to build effect militari that can train and fight alongsid our __PUNCT__
thei must help us deliv aid to those in need and encourag good govern in fragil state __PUNCT__
thei must face the threat of our world squar and not evad their global respons __PUNCT__
and thei must put an end to the mindless anti __PUNCT__ american that todai mar intern discours __PUNCT__
no allianc can work unless all it member share a basic faith in on anoth and accept an equal share of the respons to build a peac base on freedom __PUNCT__
if we strike thi new bargain and renew our transatlant solidar __PUNCT__ i believ we must then take the next step and expand the circl of our democrat commun __PUNCT__
as we speak __PUNCT__ american soldier ar serv in afghanistan alongsid british __PUNCT__ canadian __PUNCT__ dutch __PUNCT__ german __PUNCT__ italian __PUNCT__ spanish __PUNCT__ turkish __PUNCT__ polish __PUNCT__ and lithuanian soldier from the nato allianc __PUNCT__
thei ar also serv alongsid forc from australia __PUNCT__ new zealand __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ the philippin __PUNCT__ and south korea __PUNCT__ all democrat alli or close partner of the unit state __PUNCT__
but thei ar not all part of a common structur __PUNCT__
thei don't work togeth systemat or meet regularli to develop diplomat and econom strategi to meet their common problem __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ centuri world no longer divid neatli into geograph region __PUNCT__
organ and partnership must be as intern as the challeng we confront __PUNCT__
the nato allianc ha begun to deal with thi gap by promot global partnership between current member of the allianc and the other great democraci in asia and elsewher __PUNCT__
we should go further and start bring democrat peopl and nation from around the world into on common organ __PUNCT__ a worldwid leagu of democraci __PUNCT__
thi would not be like the univers __PUNCT__ membership and fail leagu of nation __PUNCT__ of woodrow wilson but much more like what theodor roosevelt envis __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ mind nation work togeth in the caus of peac __PUNCT__
the new leagu of democraci would form the core of an intern order of peac base on freedom __PUNCT__
it could act where the un fail to act __PUNCT__ to reliev human suffer in place like darfur __PUNCT__
it could join to fight the aid epidem in sub __PUNCT__ saharan africa and fashion better polici to confront the crisi of our environ __PUNCT__
it could provid unimped market access to t hose who share the valu of econom and polit freedom __PUNCT__ an advantag no state __PUNCT__ base system could attain __PUNCT__
it could bring concert pressur to bear on tyrant in burma or zimbabw __PUNCT__ with or without moscow and beij approv __PUNCT__
it could unit to impos sanction on iran and thwart it nuclear ambit __PUNCT__
it could provid support to struggl democraci in ukrain and serbia and help countri like thailand back on the path to democraci __PUNCT__
thi leagu of democraci would not supplant the unit nation or other intern organ __PUNCT__
it would complement them __PUNCT__
but it would be the on organ where the world democraci could come togeth to discuss problem and solut on the basi of share principl and a common vision of the futur __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i will call a summit of the world democraci in my first year to seek the view of my democrat counterpart and begin explor the practic step necessari to realiz thi vision __PUNCT__
american should lead thi effort __PUNCT__ as we did sixti year ago in found nato __PUNCT__
but if we ar to lead respons __PUNCT__ our friend and alli must see us as respons nation __PUNCT__ concern not onli about our own well __PUNCT__ be but about the health of the world economi and the futur of our planet __PUNCT__
throughout the cold war __PUNCT__ america support for a global econom system base on free trade and free flow of capit went hand __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hand with our support of polit freedom and democraci __PUNCT__
to build a new era of peac base on freedom __PUNCT__ we have to work even harder through our econom and trade polici to encourag open societi and creat a climat of opportun and hope __PUNCT__
our econom strategi in the middl east must complement our polit strategi by support modern who want to improv the live of their peopl against those radic and autocrat who would impoverish them __PUNCT__
in latin america and africa __PUNCT__ we need to support those who favor open economi and democrat govern against populist demagogu who ar drag their nation back to the fail socialist polici of the past __PUNCT__
in asia we need to show that grow democrat economi can do more for the averag man and woman and less for corrupt senior offici than grow economi in a on __PUNCT__ parti state __PUNCT__
american ar the most gener and care peopl in the world __PUNCT__
no on ha sacrif more in live and treasur to save the world from tyranni __PUNCT__
no nation spend more in combin public and privat philanthrop effort to combat diseas and poverti around the world __PUNCT__
and no on work harder to ensur the continu health and vital of the global economi __PUNCT__
still __PUNCT__ there is more we can do __PUNCT__
to be success intern leader __PUNCT__ we need to be good intern citizen __PUNCT__
thi mean uphold and strengthen intern law and norm __PUNCT__ includ the law of war __PUNCT__
we must champion the geneva convent __PUNCT__ and we must fulfil the letter and the spirit of our intern oblig __PUNCT__
it is profoundli in our interest to do so __PUNCT__ sinc our failur to abid by these rule put our own soldier at risk __PUNCT__
our moral stand in the world requir that we respect what ar __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ american principl of justic __PUNCT__
our valu will alwai triumph in ani war of idea __PUNCT__ and we can't let fail like prison abus tarnish our imag __PUNCT__
if we ar model citizen of the world __PUNCT__ more peopl around the world will look to us as a model __PUNCT__
when our nation wa found over two hundr year ago __PUNCT__ we were the world onli democrat republ __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar more than __NUM__ elector democraci spread all across the globe __PUNCT__
we must reaffirm our faith in the principl that our founder declar to be univers __PUNCT__ that all peopl ar creat equal and possess inalien right to life __PUNCT__ liberti __PUNCT__ and the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__
we fought a revolut __PUNCT__ a civil war __PUNCT__ two world war __PUNCT__ and a cold war to vindic these principl and ensur that freedom could be enjoi __PUNCT__ as abraham lincoln promis __PUNCT__ by all __PUNCT__ peopl of all color everywher __PUNCT__
we were right to struggl for democraci then __PUNCT__ and we ar right to do so now __PUNCT__
thi is not ideal __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__
it is the truest kind of realism __PUNCT__
todai as in the past __PUNCT__ our interest ar inextric link to the global progress of our ideal __PUNCT__
the vision of a new era of endur peac base on freedom is not a republican vision __PUNCT__
it is not a democrat vision __PUNCT__
it is an american vision __PUNCT__
the american peopl have known instinct for two centuri that we ar safer when the world is more democrat __PUNCT__
whatev our differ __PUNCT__ we all share the same goal __PUNCT__ a world of peac and freedom __PUNCT__ of prosper and opportun __PUNCT__ of hope __PUNCT__
we have a duti to ourselv to be true to those belief __PUNCT__ to us our great power wise on behalf of freedom __PUNCT__
as ronald reagan proclaim in hi speech to the british parliament in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ let us go to our strength __PUNCT__
let us offer hope __PUNCT__
let us tell the world that a new ag is not onli possibl but probabl __PUNCT__
