my friend __PUNCT__ in on week we will have as close to a nation primari as we have ever had in thi countri __PUNCT__
i intend to win it __PUNCT__ and be the nomine of our parti __PUNCT__
and i intend to do that by make it clear what i stand for __PUNCT__
i stand for the principl and polici that first attract me to the republican parti when i heard __PUNCT__ in whisper convers and tap code __PUNCT__ about the then governor of california __PUNCT__ who stood by me and my comrad __PUNCT__ and who wa make quit a reput for stand by hi convict no matter the chang wind of polit thought and popular cultur __PUNCT__
when i left the navi and enter public life __PUNCT__ i enlist as a foot soldier in the polit revolut he began __PUNCT__
and i am as proud to be a reagan conserv todai __PUNCT__ as i wa then __PUNCT__
i trust in the courag __PUNCT__ good sens __PUNCT__ resourc and decenc of the american peopl __PUNCT__ who deserv a govern that trust in their qualiti as well __PUNCT__ and doesn't abrog to it elf the respons to do for the peopl what the peopl can and want to do for themselv __PUNCT__
we republican have alwai known that the first respons of govern is to keep thi countri safe from all enemi foreign and domest __PUNCT__ and the american peopl unburden by the heavi hand of govern that spend too much of their monei on thing thei neither want nor need __PUNCT__ while fail to do as well as we should the thing none of us can do individu __PUNCT__
govern must defend our nation secur wise and effect __PUNCT__ becaus the cost of our defens is so dear to us __PUNCT__ measur in loss so hard to bear __PUNCT__ and in the heartbreak of so mani famili __PUNCT__
govern must respect our valu becaus thei ar the true sourc of our strength __PUNCT__ and enforc the rule __PUNCT__ which distinguish success democraci from fail societi __PUNCT__ and is the first defens of freedom __PUNCT__
and the judg we appoint to feder bench must understand that is their onli respons __PUNCT__ and leav to elect offici their respons to make the law that thei enforc __PUNCT__
we believ govern should do onli those thing we cannot do individu __PUNCT__ to tax us no more than necessari __PUNCT__ and spend no more than necessari __PUNCT__ and then get out of the wai of the most industri __PUNCT__ ingeni and optimist peopl in the histori of the world so that thei can build an even greater countri than the on thei inherit __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ as i said the other week in south carolina __PUNCT__ there is noth in our countri that is inevit __PUNCT__
we can overcom ani challeng as long as we keep our courag __PUNCT__ and stand by the principl that have made our parti and our countri great __PUNCT__
our parti ha alwai been success when we have __PUNCT__ like ronald reagan __PUNCT__ stood fast by our convict __PUNCT__
and we have onli suffer when our allegi to our principl ha not been as steadfast as it should __PUNCT__
i intend to make my stand on those principl __PUNCT__ and i am confid we will succe in thi contest and in the bigger on in __DATE__ against anyon the democrat parti nomin __PUNCT__
most importantli __PUNCT__ i promis you again __PUNCT__ i will alwai put america __PUNCT__ her strength __PUNCT__ her ideal __PUNCT__ her futur __PUNCT__ befor everi other consider __PUNCT__
