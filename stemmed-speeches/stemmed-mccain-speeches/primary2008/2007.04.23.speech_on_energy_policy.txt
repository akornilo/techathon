thank you __PUNCT__
i appreci the invit to talk with you about a great and urgent challeng __PUNCT__ break our nation critic depend on foreign sourc of oil __PUNCT__ and make america safer __PUNCT__ stronger and more prosper by modern the wai we gener and emploi energi __PUNCT__
oil is often call the lifeblood of our economi __PUNCT__ the indispens commod that keep commerc hum and america on the move __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ in todai world __PUNCT__ our depend on foreign oil and the wai we us hydrocarbon is a major strateg vulner __PUNCT__ a seriou threat to our secur __PUNCT__ our economi and the well be of our planet __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ there ar time in a nation histori when great challeng coalesc with great moment of opportun __PUNCT__
we ar at such a moment todai __PUNCT__
we have the urgent need and the opportun to build a safer and thrive futur with more divers __PUNCT__ reliabl __PUNCT__ and cleaner energi __PUNCT__
but it will take anoth indispens commod to make it happen __PUNCT__ american leadership __PUNCT__
i run for presid to help provid that leadership __PUNCT__
and i want to talk a littl todai about the direct i want to lead us and why __PUNCT__
oil is a vital resourc and we will alwai need it __PUNCT__
but we account for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of global demand and possess less than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of proven reserv __PUNCT__
most of the world known reserv ar in the persian gulf __PUNCT__ in the hand of dictat or nation oil compani __PUNCT__
it avail and price ar manipul by a cartel of countri where our valu aren't typic share and our interest aren't their first prioriti __PUNCT__
by mid __PUNCT__ centuri there will be three __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half billion car worldwid __PUNCT__ over four time the number todai __PUNCT__
most of the growth will take place in the develop world __PUNCT__ in india and china __PUNCT__ but the increas in fuel price __PUNCT__ pollut __PUNCT__ and climat impact will be felt worldwid __PUNCT__
as world demand for oil soar __PUNCT__ higher price __PUNCT__ sever econom volatil __PUNCT__ and heighten intern tension follow __PUNCT__
these unpredict forc could serious circumscrib our futur if we let them __PUNCT__
great nation don't leav the __PUNCT__ lifeblood __PUNCT__ of their economi in the hand of foreign cartel or bet their futur on a commod locat in countri where authoritarian repress their peopl and terrorist find their main support __PUNCT__
terrorist understand the serious of our vulner __PUNCT__
al qaeda plan for attack on oil facil in the middl east to destroi the american economi __PUNCT__
a littl over a year ago __PUNCT__ a suicid attack at a major saudi arabian oil refineri came close to disabl it target __PUNCT__
had it succeed __PUNCT__ it would have driven the world price of oil abov __MONEY__ dollar a barrel __PUNCT__ and kept it there for a year __PUNCT__
we on success attack awai from an econom crisi __PUNCT__
the flow of oil ha mani chokepoint __PUNCT__ pipelin __PUNCT__ refineri __PUNCT__ transit rout __PUNCT__ and termin __PUNCT__ most of them outsid our jurisdict and control __PUNCT__
our enemi understand the effect on america of a signific disrupt in suppli __PUNCT__ a crippl transport system __PUNCT__ gasolin too expens for mani american to purchas __PUNCT__ busi close __PUNCT__
al qaeda must revel in the ironi that america is effect help to fund both side of the war thei caus __PUNCT__
as we sacrific blood and treasur __PUNCT__ some of our ga dollar flow to the fanat who build the bomb __PUNCT__ hatch the plot __PUNCT__ and carri out attack on our soldier and citizen __PUNCT__
iran made over __MONEY__ billion from oil sale in __NUM__ and it is the number on state sponsor of terror __PUNCT__
the transfer of american wealth to the middl east help sustain the condit on which terrorist prei __PUNCT__
some of the most oil __PUNCT__ rich nation ar the most stagnant societi on earth __PUNCT__
as long as petro __PUNCT__ dollar flow freeli to them those regim have littl incent to open their polit and economi so that all their peopl mai benefit from their countri __PUNCT__ natur wealth __PUNCT__
the middl east exampl is spread to our own hemispher __PUNCT__
venezuela hugo chavez is us hi countri oil revenu to establish a dictatorship __PUNCT__ bulli hi neighbor and succe castro as latin america lead antagonist of the unit state __PUNCT__
the polit of oil imped the global progress of our valu __PUNCT__ and restrain govern from act on the most basic impuls of human decenc __PUNCT__
there is onli on reason china ha oppos sanction to pressur sudan to stop the kill in darfur __PUNCT__ china need sudan oil __PUNCT__
the burn of oil and other fossil fuel is contribut to the danger accumul of greenhous gase in the earth atmospher __PUNCT__ alter our climat with the potenti for major social __PUNCT__ econom and polit upheav __PUNCT__
the world is alreadi feel the power effect of global warm __PUNCT__ and far more dire consequ ar predict if we let the grow delug of greenhous ga emiss continu __PUNCT__ and wreak havoc with god creation __PUNCT__
a group of senior retir militari offic recent warn about the potenti upheav caus by conflict over water __PUNCT__ arabl land and other natur resourc under strain from a warm planet __PUNCT__
the problem isn't a hollywood invent nor is do someth about it a vaniti of cassandra like hyster __PUNCT__
it is a seriou and urgent econom __PUNCT__ environment and nation secur challeng __PUNCT__
nation secur depend on energi secur __PUNCT__ which we cannot achiev if we remain depend on import oil from middl eastern govern who support or foment by their own inattent and inequ the rise of terrorist or on swagger demagogu and would be dictat in our hemispher __PUNCT__
there no doubt it an enorm challeng __PUNCT__
but is it too big a challeng for america to tackl __PUNCT__ thi great countri that ha never befor confront a problem it couldn't solv __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it is not __PUNCT__
no peopl have ever been better innov and problem solver than american __PUNCT__
it is in our nation dna to see challeng as opportun __PUNCT__ to conquer problem beyond the expect of an admir world __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ reli as alwai on the industri and imagin of a free peopl __PUNCT__ and the power and innov of free market __PUNCT__ is capabl of overcom ani challeng from within and without our border __PUNCT__
our enemi believ we too weak to overcom our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
even some of our alli think we no longer the world most visionari __PUNCT__ most capabl countri or commit to the advanc of mankind __PUNCT__
i think we know better than that __PUNCT__
i think we know who we ar and what we can do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let remind the world __PUNCT__
georg gershwin wrote that good music reflect it peopl and time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ my peopl ar american __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ my time is todai __PUNCT__
that what made hi music memor __PUNCT__
that what made all america best accomplish memor __PUNCT__
we were capabl and confid __PUNCT__ we aspir to great and we understood our time __PUNCT__
our time is todai __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ and the achiev of our stori past will shine no brighter than those we accomplish right now __PUNCT__ in our time __PUNCT__ if we meet our problem confid and honestli __PUNCT__ if we trust in the strength and ideal of free peopl __PUNCT__ if we aspir to great __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i propos a nation energi strategi that will amount to a declar of independ from the fear bred by our relianc on oil sheik and our vulner to the troubl polit of the land thei rule __PUNCT__
when we reach the limit of militari power and diplomaci to contain the danger of that cauldron of burn resent and extrem __PUNCT__ energi secur is our best defens __PUNCT__
we won't achiev it tomorrow __PUNCT__ but we must achiev it in our time __PUNCT__
the strategi i propos won't be anoth grab bag of handout to thi or that industri and a full employ act for lobbyist __PUNCT__
it will promot the diversif and conserv of our energi sourc that will in suffici time break the domin of oil in our transport sector just as we diversifi awai from oil us in electr power gener thirti year ago __PUNCT__ and substanti reduc the impact of our energi consumpt on the planet __PUNCT__
it will reli on the geniu and technolog prowess of american industri and scienc __PUNCT__
govern must set achiev goal __PUNCT__ but the market should be free to produc the mean __PUNCT__
and those mean ar within our reach __PUNCT__
energi effici by us improv technolog and practic sensibl habit in our home __PUNCT__ busi and automobil is a big part of the answer __PUNCT__ and is someth we can achiev right now __PUNCT__
and new advanc will make conserv an ever more import part of the solut __PUNCT__
improv light bulb can us much less energi __PUNCT__ smart grid technolog can help homeown and busi lower their energi us __PUNCT__ and breakthrough in high tech materi can greatli improv fuel effici in the transport sector __PUNCT__
we need to dispel the imag of conserv that entail shiver in cold room __PUNCT__ read by candlelight __PUNCT__ and lower product __PUNCT__
american have it in their power todai to contribut to our nation secur __PUNCT__ prosper and a cleaner environ __PUNCT__
thei understand the danger we face __PUNCT__ and ar prepar to respond to appeal to patriot that explain how we can free ourselv from them __PUNCT__
we need not wait for anoth ag __PUNCT__ in which scienc fiction becom everi dai realiti __PUNCT__
flexibl __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl aren't futurist pie in the sky __PUNCT__
we can easili deploi such technolog todai for less than __MONEY__ per vehicl __PUNCT__ and we must develop the infrastructur necessari to take full advantag __PUNCT__
we were abl to overcom the challeng of put seatbelt __PUNCT__ airbag __PUNCT__ and comput technolog in practic everi car __PUNCT__
we can provid fuel option and improv the fuel effici of our vehicl fleet by make them out of high tech materi that improv their strength and safeti __PUNCT__
we ar do that veri thing right now to beat our foreign competitor in the aerospac industri __PUNCT__
alcohol fuel made from corn __PUNCT__ sugar __PUNCT__ switch grass and mani other sourc __PUNCT__ fuel cell __PUNCT__ biodiesel deriv from wast product __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ and other technolog ar all promis and avail altern to oil __PUNCT__
i won't support subsid everi altern or tariff that restrict the healthi competit that stimul innov and lower cost __PUNCT__
but i encourag the develop of infrastructur and market growth necessari for these product to compet __PUNCT__ and let consum choos the winner __PUNCT__
i never known an american entrepreneur worthi of the name who wouldn't rather compet for sale than subsidi __PUNCT__
america electr product is for the most part petroleum free __PUNCT__ and the exist electr power grid ha the capac to handl the ad demand impos by plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid vehicl __PUNCT__
we can add more capac and improv it reliabl in the year ahead __PUNCT__
nuclear energi __PUNCT__ renew power __PUNCT__ and other emiss free form of power product can expand capac __PUNCT__ improv local air qualiti and address climat chang __PUNCT__
i work to promot real partnership between util and automak to acceler the deploy of plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__
with some of the save from cut subsidi for industri that can stand on their own __PUNCT__ we can establish a nation challeng to improv the cost __PUNCT__ rang __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ and weight of electr batteri for automobil __PUNCT__
fifti percent of car on the road ar driven __NUM__ mile a dai or less __PUNCT__
afford batteri __PUNCT__ power vehicl that can meet averag commut need could help us cut oil import in half __PUNCT__
the reward will be earn through merit by whomev accomplish the task __PUNCT__ whether a laboratori in the depart of energi __PUNCT__ a univers __PUNCT__ a corpor or an enterpris young inventor who work out of hi famili garag __PUNCT__
there is much we can do to increas our own oil product in wai that protect the environ us advanc technolog __PUNCT__ includ those that us and buri carbon dioxid __PUNCT__ to recov the oil below the well we have alreadi drill __PUNCT__ and tap oil __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ and shale econom with minim environment impact __PUNCT__
the unit state ha coal reserv more abund than saudi arabia oil reserv __PUNCT__
we found a wai to cut down acid rain pollut from burn coal __PUNCT__ and we can find a wai to us our coal resourc without emit excess greenhous gase __PUNCT__
we have in us todai a zero emiss energi that could provid electr for million more home and busi than it current doe __PUNCT__
yet it ha been over twenti __PUNCT__ five year sinc a nuclear power plant ha been construct __PUNCT__
the barrier to nuclear energi ar polit not technolog __PUNCT__
we let the fear of thirti year ago __PUNCT__ and an endless polit squabbl over the storag of nuclear spent fuel make it virtual imposs to build a singl new plant that produc a form of energi that is safe and non __PUNCT__ pollut __PUNCT__
if franc can produc __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of it electr with nuclear power __PUNCT__ why can't we __PUNCT__ is franc a more secur __PUNCT__ advanc and innov countri than we ar __PUNCT__ ar franc scientist and entrepreneur more capabl than we ar __PUNCT__ i need no answer to that rhetor question __PUNCT__
i know my countri well enough to know otherwis __PUNCT__
let provid for safe storag of spent nuclear fuel __PUNCT__ and give host state or local a proprietari interest so when advanc recycl technolog turn us fuel into a valuabl commod __PUNCT__ the public will share in it econom benefit __PUNCT__
i want to improv and make perman the research and develop tax credit __PUNCT__
i want to spend less monei on govern bureaucraci __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ where the privat sector isn't move out of regulatori fear __PUNCT__ to form the partnership necessari to build demonstr model of promis new technolog such as advanc nuclear power plant __PUNCT__ coal gasif __PUNCT__ carbon captur and storag __PUNCT__ and renew power so we can take maximum advantag of our most abund resourc __PUNCT__
and i make it a nation mission to develop a catalyst capabl of break down carbon dioxid into us chemic build block __PUNCT__ and render it a new sourc of revenu and opportun __PUNCT__
america compet in a global economi where innov and entrepreneurship ar the pillar of prosper __PUNCT__
the competit is stiff and the stake ar high __PUNCT__
we have the opportun to appli america technolog supremaci to captur the export market for advanc energi technolog __PUNCT__ reap the capit invest and good job it will provid __PUNCT__
our innov __PUNCT__ scientist __PUNCT__ entrepreneur and worker have the knowledg __PUNCT__ resourc __PUNCT__ and drive to lead the wai on energi secur __PUNCT__ as we have in so mani other world __PUNCT__ chang advanc __PUNCT__
the race ha alwai been to the swift __PUNCT__ and america must be first to market with innov that meet mankind grow energi and environment need __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ govern should set the standard __PUNCT__ and leav it to the marketplac to win the race __PUNCT__
i have propos a bipartisan plan to address the problem of climat chang and stimul the develop and us of advanc technolog __PUNCT__
it is a market __PUNCT__ base approach that would set reason cap on carbon and other greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ and provid industri with tradabl credit __PUNCT__
by reduc it emiss __PUNCT__ a util or industri plant can gener credit it mai trade on the open market for a profit __PUNCT__ offer a power incent to drive the deploy of new and better energi sourc and technolog __PUNCT__ for automak to develop new wai to lower pollut and increas mileag __PUNCT__ for util to gener cleaner electr and captur carbon __PUNCT__ for applianc manufactur to make more effici product __PUNCT__ and for the nation to us energi with maximum effici __PUNCT__ build conserv into the economi in a manner that produc financi and environment benefit __PUNCT__
dupont corpor ha reap __MONEY__ billion dollar in energi save and reduc it carbon emiss by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
as it alwai doe __PUNCT__ the profit motiv will attract the transform power of ventur capit __PUNCT__ and unleash the market to move clean altern fuel and advanc energi technolog from the margin into the mainstream __PUNCT__
some urg we do noth becaus we can't be certain how bad the problem might becom or thei presum the worst effect ar most like to occur in our grandchildren lifetim __PUNCT__
i a proud conserv __PUNCT__ and i reject that kind of live __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ me gener __PUNCT__ attitud __PUNCT__
it is unworthi of us and incompat with our reput as visionari and problem solver __PUNCT__
american have never fear chang __PUNCT__
we make chang work for us __PUNCT__
in the come month __PUNCT__ other propos will be offer to establish a nation climat polici __PUNCT__
i welcom thi __PUNCT__
but let not let urgenc breed rash and irrespons __PUNCT__
i claim no monopoli on the best answer __PUNCT__
let the marketplac of idea flourish __PUNCT__
but as there is great reward in the respons polici __PUNCT__ there also enorm risk in the wrong wai forward __PUNCT__
the polici must includ mechan to control cost and protect the economi __PUNCT__
just as there is danger in do too littl __PUNCT__ there is peril in go too far __PUNCT__ too fast __PUNCT__ in a wai that impos unsustain cost on the economi __PUNCT__
i believ __PUNCT__ cap and trade __PUNCT__ is the best wai to manag cost and maxim benefit __PUNCT__ but we must look at other market __PUNCT__ base mean to give ad assur that our polici ar an instrument of job creation __PUNCT__ econom progress __PUNCT__ and environment problem solv __PUNCT__
climat chang is a global problem that requir a global solut __PUNCT__
but we know america ha both an oblig and a compel nation interest in fulfil our histor leadership role __PUNCT__
china carbon emiss will soon exce our __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will invit a collabor relationship with china to make coal us cleaner and climat friendli __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ we should address the problem on our term __PUNCT__ and bring other into the fold of a common sens effort to solv it __PUNCT__ while we sell to the world the technolog need to do it __PUNCT__
answer great challeng is noth new to america __PUNCT__
it what we do __PUNCT__
we built the rocket that took us to the moon not becaus it wa easi but becaus it wa hard __PUNCT__
we sent space probe into the distant reach of the univers __PUNCT__
we har nuclear energi __PUNCT__ map the human genom __PUNCT__ creat the internet and pioneer integr circuit that possess the comput power of apollo spacecraft on a singl silicon chip you can bare see __PUNCT__
in twenti year we gone from us thi cell phone __PUNCT__ a __MONEY__ toi for the wealthi __PUNCT__ to thi cell phone __PUNCT__ an inexpens and virtual univers mean of commun __PUNCT__
we can solv our oil depend __PUNCT__
you can't sell me on hopeless __PUNCT__
you can't convinc me the problem is insurmount __PUNCT__
i know my countri __PUNCT__
i know what we capabl of __PUNCT__
we capabl of unimagin progress __PUNCT__ unmatch prosper __PUNCT__ and vision that see around the corner of histori __PUNCT__
we alwai understood our time __PUNCT__ accept our challeng and made from our opportun __PUNCT__ anoth better world __PUNCT__
my peopl ar american __PUNCT__
our time is todai __PUNCT__
that is the countri i ask to lead __PUNCT__
