stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you a superstiti man __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ let me sai that i the luckiest man __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i don't like to us superstiti __PUNCT__
i just feel that i veri lucki __PUNCT__ and i like to have thing that make me luckier __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so when wa the first moment you let yourself believ __PUNCT__ i go to be the nomine __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i haven't yet __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you haven't yet __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we got to go through it __PUNCT__
i think we got a veri good shot at it __PUNCT__
i optimist __PUNCT__
but i think the time to do that is when __PUNCT__ former arkansa __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ mike __PUNCT__ huckabe and the parti decid that i am the nomine __PUNCT__
he still in the race __PUNCT__ and he said he go to stai in __PUNCT__ and i respect that __PUNCT__
so we compet __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ you said __PUNCT__ i have no doubt that sen __PUNCT__ hillari __PUNCT__ clinton would make a good presid __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ here __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ clinton and i ar sit next to each other __PUNCT__ and we ask __PUNCT__ would she __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ be a good presid __PUNCT__ she would be a good presid in the respect that i think she ha integr __PUNCT__ i think she ha all of the qualiti that ar necessari __PUNCT__ but she ha a veri differ philosoph view __PUNCT__ the liber democrat view __PUNCT__ than i have __PUNCT__ which is conserv republican __PUNCT__
so when you sai __PUNCT__ good __PUNCT__ she a good person __PUNCT__
but we have strong differ in our view of govern __PUNCT__
i think she is a veri good person __PUNCT__
i think that sen __PUNCT__ barack __PUNCT__ obama is a good person __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but not good presid __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ thei certainli wouldn't make the kind of presid that i would be or i wouldn't be run __PUNCT__
you see my point __PUNCT__ it not a __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ good __PUNCT__
i think thei would work hard __PUNCT__
i think thei would be dedic to the thing that thei believ in and stand for __PUNCT__
i just have differ fundament philosoph view than thei do __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but it sound like you wouldn't sai the same thing todai __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i would sai that thei would be good in the respect thei peopl of good charact __PUNCT__ honesti __PUNCT__ integr __PUNCT__ when you look at that __PUNCT__
would thei be good from a govern standpoint __PUNCT__ certainli not what i would do for thi countri __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama focus on you on tuesdai night __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i heard __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ the first issu he rais wa iraq __PUNCT__
obama __PUNCT__ i will offer a clear choic __PUNCT__
john mccain won't be abl to sai that i ever support thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ becaus i oppos it from the start __PUNCT__
senat mccain said the other dai that we might be mire for __NUM__ year in iraq __PUNCT__
__NUM__ year __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ he sai the wrong war __PUNCT__ the wrong time __PUNCT__ not worth the cost in the blood and treasur __PUNCT__
you obvious have a veri differ view __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ and the countri seem to agre __PUNCT__ at least right now __PUNCT__ with him __PUNCT__
can you win that argument __PUNCT__ and can you win the white hous if you don't __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i am confid that i can convinc the american peopl that the consequ of a date for withdraw ar catastroph and al qaeda trumpet that thei win __PUNCT__
i believ i can convinc the american peopl that after nearli four year of mishandl of the war that we now do the right thing and we succeed __PUNCT__
i think i can convinc the american peopl that __PUNCT__ continu with thi strategi __PUNCT__ we will be abl to withdraw more troop __PUNCT__ we will provid a polit and econom stabil __PUNCT__ along with militari stabil __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ let me just remind you that sen __PUNCT__ clinton and sen __PUNCT__ obama both said the surg wouldn't work __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ thei said it wouldn't work __PUNCT__
most object observ believ that it is __PUNCT__
then thei said that polit there would never be ani progress in iraq __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thei just pass a seri of law a littl bit better than what we do in washington __PUNCT__
thei pass a budget __PUNCT__
but more importantli __PUNCT__ thei go to have provinci elect __PUNCT__
more importantli __PUNCT__ thei go to have __PUNCT__ resolv thi issu of sunni integr into the govern and societi __PUNCT__
and thei ar make progress __PUNCT__
so thei wrong again __PUNCT__
thei ar wrong about __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but if iraq is meet those mark __PUNCT__ then why not withdraw our troop step by step __PUNCT__ as sen __PUNCT__ obama and sen __PUNCT__ clinton call for __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ becaus it ha to be dictat by event on the ground __PUNCT__ not by an arbitrari date and not an arbitrari date __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but if we ar make progress __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ we ar make signific progress __PUNCT__
and gener __PUNCT__ david __PUNCT__ petraeu __PUNCT__ command of coalit forc in iraq __PUNCT__ will come back the begin of __DATE__ and he will testifi to that __PUNCT__ but he will be __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ the major determin factor __PUNCT__ becaus he ha succeed __PUNCT__ as to when and how we would draw addit troop __PUNCT__
it can't be done __PUNCT__ pluck out of the air __PUNCT__ that we just go to withdraw __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ presid bush is also negoti a long __PUNCT__ term statu of forc agreement with iraq __PUNCT__
both sen __PUNCT__ clinton and sen __PUNCT__ obama sai that agreement ha to come to the congress __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ it wouldn't bother me to bring it to the congress __PUNCT__
i don't think that a huge deal __PUNCT__
we have statu of forc __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ presid bush sai he doesn't want to __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ if we succe in iraq __PUNCT__ which i believ we ar __PUNCT__ the rest of it take care of itself __PUNCT__
we have statu of forc agreement with a number of countri that have never been approv by congress __PUNCT__ we have some other that have been approv by congress __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but the big on __PUNCT__ korea wa approv by congress __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ but we have some countri __PUNCT__ we still in bosnia __PUNCT__
we don't have a statu of forc agreement there __PUNCT__ as i recal __PUNCT__
we have __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ crosstalk __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't have a problem with go to the congress __PUNCT__ becaus i think the issu take care of itself when we succe __PUNCT__
i still sai set a date for withdraw is chao __PUNCT__ genocid __PUNCT__ and we be back __PUNCT__ becaus al qaeda will then succe __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ how about iran __PUNCT__ you said mani __PUNCT__ mani time the onli thing wors than war with iran is a nuclear iran __PUNCT__
would presid mccain come to congress befor take militari action against iran __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ unless it wa some dire emerg that requir __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ thei were about to launch or someth like that __PUNCT__
but under most __PUNCT__ almost all reason scenario __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__ i realli believ that __PUNCT__ have been a member of congress all these year __PUNCT__ that we have to have more of a partnership with the congress __PUNCT__
we have to have more consult __PUNCT__
we have to do those thing __PUNCT__
but there still is onli on titl of command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ on person with that titl __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ __NUM__ issu right now __PUNCT__ the economi __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama went at that on tuesdai night __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
obama __PUNCT__ i admir sen __PUNCT__ mccain when he stood up and said that it offend hi conscienc to support the bush tax cut for the wealthi in the time of __URL__ somewher along the road to the republican nomin __PUNCT__ the straight talk express lost it wheel becaus now it is all for those same tax cut __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ he sai basic you sacrif your principl for the sake of the nomin __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ for a long time i have said that i thought the tax cut ought to be made perman __PUNCT__
for a long time back __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we got to have spend restraint __PUNCT__ the wai that reagan did when he restor our economi when it wa in the tank __PUNCT__ thank to then __PUNCT__ presid carter mismanag of the economi __PUNCT__ and we enter into a great period of prosper in america __PUNCT__
spend restraint is why our base is not energ __PUNCT__
spend restraint is why we ar have to borrow monei from china __PUNCT__ and we got to have spend restraint __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__
but to impos on the american peopl what essenti would be a tax increas of thousand of dollar per famili in america is not someth i think __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i sure would be bad for the economi of thi countri __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so on tax __PUNCT__ ar you a __PUNCT__ read my lip __PUNCT__ candid __PUNCT__ no new tax __PUNCT__ no matter what __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no new tax __PUNCT__
i do not __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ i could see an argument __PUNCT__ if our economi continu to deterior __PUNCT__ for lower interest rate __PUNCT__ lower tax rate __PUNCT__ and certainli decreas corpor tax rate __PUNCT__ which ar the second __PUNCT__ highest in the world __PUNCT__ give peopl the abil to write off depreci in a year __PUNCT__ elimin of the amt __PUNCT__
there a lot of thing that i would think we should to reliev that burden __PUNCT__ includ __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ as we all know __PUNCT__ simplif of the tax code __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but under circumst would you increas tax __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ how about __PUNCT__ what els would you do right now to get thi economi move again __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl ar worri about it __PUNCT__
mani democrat have said and mani outsid economist have said we in a recess right now __PUNCT__
do you think we ar __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ accord to what the expert __PUNCT__ bernank and other __PUNCT__ ar sai __PUNCT__ we veri close to it __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ closer to it than we have been __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ for some time __PUNCT__
i think it veri import that we send a signal to the american peopl we go to stop the earmark pork __PUNCT__ barrel spend __PUNCT__
is that a huge part of the budget __PUNCT__ crosstalk __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ becaus it out of control __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ on reason is __PUNCT__ if you __PUNCT__ in the last two year __PUNCT__ the presid ha sign into law __MONEY__ billion worth of pork __PUNCT__ barrel project __PUNCT__
that would have been __MONEY__ tax credit for everi child in america __PUNCT__
wouldn't it have been better for our economi to give __MONEY__ tax credit for everi child in america __PUNCT__ as oppos to a bridg to nowher in alaska __PUNCT__ and it also ha a confid impact __PUNCT__ a confid impact that the american peopl see their tax dollar be fritter awai in wast and unnecessari spend __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama ha engag in heavili and sen __PUNCT__ clinton ha engag in heavili __PUNCT__
thei bought in __PUNCT__
thei talk about chang __PUNCT__ i want chang to be stop thi wast of american tax dollar __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but is that realli the answer to the hous crisi we see right now __PUNCT__ the credit crunch we see __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it is __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ the anxieti american ar feel __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we got to __PUNCT__ i glad we did the stimulu packag __PUNCT__
i think we need to have lower interest rate __PUNCT__
i think we need to elimin the amt __PUNCT__
i think we need to have depreci in on year of busi invest __PUNCT__
i think we need to reduc the corpor tax rate __PUNCT__ which is the second highest in the world __PUNCT__ onli exceed by japan __PUNCT__
i think there a long seri of step we need to take __PUNCT__ and mani of them we haven't even contempl yet __PUNCT__ if necessari __PUNCT__
but have the impact of a tax increas is certainli not on of them __PUNCT__
and that is what sen __PUNCT__ obama and sen __PUNCT__ clinton ar sai __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ thei have also said __PUNCT__ both sen __PUNCT__ obama and sen __PUNCT__ clinton have said we need a govern fund to provid __PUNCT__ to help borrow who ar face foreclosur on their home __PUNCT__
good idea __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__ yet __PUNCT__
we have the fha work __PUNCT__
we have a number of institut work with them __PUNCT__
but i will be glad to do whatev is necessari to reliev the burden of peopl who ar legitim borrow who see their home loan interest payment so high __PUNCT__ mortgag payment so high that thei can't afford it anymor __PUNCT__
but i don't want to reward peopl who engag in specul __PUNCT__
and i certainli don't want to reward institut that engag in the practic of lend peopl that couldn't afford to pai back the loan __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but you open to help homeown __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i am open to help homeown __PUNCT__
i would reli to a larg degre on the situat __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ but also peopl like secretari of treasuri paulson __PUNCT__ who the financi market and a lot of us have a great deal of faith in __PUNCT__
if more need to be done __PUNCT__ i for do more __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you mention earlier that we need lower interest rate __PUNCT__
do you believ that ben bernank ha been too slow off the mark __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it hard for me to make the judgment __PUNCT__
usual these judgment ar made in the rear __PUNCT__ view mirror __PUNCT__ as we know __PUNCT__
but i person would have like to have seen those rate cut earlier __PUNCT__
a lot of the peopl that i respect that ar advis me __PUNCT__ like phil gramm and jack kemp and so mani other that ar in our team __PUNCT__ on our team __PUNCT__ said that thei would have like to have seen it earlier __PUNCT__
so i guess i would have to sai i would have like to have seen faster rate cut and earlier than thei were done by him __PUNCT__
that doesn't mean i want him fire __PUNCT__ it doesn't mean that i lost confid in __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ re __PUNCT__ appoint him if you elect __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i think that those term of offic ar __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
