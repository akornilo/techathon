freedom work for everyon __PUNCT__ and onli through freedom ha america achiev what wa onc thought imposs __PUNCT__ a system in which ordinari peopl with ordinari abil can creat for themselv extraordinari live __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we find ourselv at a time when the u. __PUNCT__ economi is weaker than anyon would like __PUNCT__
while nation econom growth continu __PUNCT__ indic of the futur ar mix __PUNCT__
the current weak is larg the fallout from market excess __PUNCT__
hous specul felt that price would alwai rise and took out riski mortgag __PUNCT__
investor that bought those mortgag seemingli believ that the rate of return wa the result of clever financi engin __PUNCT__ not the abil of home __PUNCT__ buyer to make their payment __PUNCT__

as you ar well awar __PUNCT__ condit in michigan ar even tougher with the state suffer through on of the most sever recess sinc world war ii __PUNCT__
tough time can breed fear __PUNCT__ and the democrat ar us those fear to push an agenda that is tire and danger __PUNCT__
onc again thei want the govern to make our choic for us __PUNCT__ not respect our dream __PUNCT__ and trust our decis on how best to seiz our opportun __PUNCT__
thei ar threaten to grow the govern and us the american economi to serv their polit end __PUNCT__ not your aspir __PUNCT__
thei will tax __PUNCT__ spend __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__ and dictat for the benefit of special interest and partisan object __PUNCT__ and thei ar help to caus a rise tide of econom isolation that threaten our prosper and the stabil of friendli nation __PUNCT__
the pattern of reckless govern spend ha caus american to lose trust in their govern __PUNCT__
i been around long enough to know that thi will fail __PUNCT__
and when it doe __PUNCT__ american will have yet anoth reason to question their govern __PUNCT__
politician need to rememb that an effect govern is a limit govern __PUNCT__
govern polici should enhanc __PUNCT__ not diminish __PUNCT__ the opportun avail to american worker __PUNCT__
protectionist trade measur trigger escal protectionist respons in other nation that harm american worker and american consum __PUNCT__
democrat tell us we can build a wall around america __PUNCT__ but we can't hide __PUNCT__
the unit state can compet and win in the world marketplac __PUNCT__
corpor welfar increas the size of govern and divert resourc from the grow industri that hold the kei to america continu econom success __PUNCT__
excess and intrus regul undermin the flexibl need for busi success __PUNCT__
these exampl illustr why part of the conserv tradit in american polit ha been the idea that sometim the govern can best serv the interest of the american peopl by know when to stai out of their wai __PUNCT__
sinc adam smith coin the phrase __PUNCT__ the invis hand __PUNCT__ economist __PUNCT__ philosoph __PUNCT__ and other have debat virtu of market economi __PUNCT__
you even hear some presidenti candid claim to understand the finer nuanc of market and manag __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ success ha noth to do with fanci theori __PUNCT__
the simpl lesson of histori is that there is no econom forc on thi globe that is stronger than free peopl __PUNCT__
freedom and initi were the kei to our past success and thei ar the kei to our futur on as well __PUNCT__
ronald reagan onc said that __PUNCT__ freedom is the right to question and chang the establish wai of do thing __PUNCT__
it is the continu revolut of the marketplac __PUNCT__
it is the understand that allow us to recogn shortcom and seek solut __PUNCT__

job secur is an element of particular concern to michigan worker __PUNCT__ particularli those in the ail automot industri __PUNCT__
econom insecur is seemingli the buzzword of todai __PUNCT__
entrepreneur ar the best antidot for both __PUNCT__
but we must preserv their freedom __PUNCT__
entrepreneur should not be shackl by excess regul that rais the cost of busi __PUNCT__
entrepreneur should not be disadvantag by earmark and pork __PUNCT__ barrel spend that favor polit connect competitor __PUNCT__
entrepreneur should not be starv of risk capit by burdensom account requir that drive capit to other market __PUNCT__
entrepreneur should not be tax into submiss __PUNCT__

you and i both know that rise health care cost ar a threat to our global competit __PUNCT__ a threat to our famili __PUNCT__ budget __PUNCT__ a threat to our govern solvenc __PUNCT__ and a threat to the profit of american busi __PUNCT__
america ha the best health care in the world and we must work to keep it so __PUNCT__ but we must also work to control cost and make that care more access __PUNCT__
on wai to accomplish those goal is to help small busi link togeth to provid health care to their employe __PUNCT__

we can have a singl __PUNCT__ fair and simpler system built on a few tax rate for consum incom and straightforward credit for work __PUNCT__ health __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and those with a famili __PUNCT__
we can make our person and busi tax system work cohes so that we can shed our statu as on of the least attract tax jurisdict on earth __PUNCT__
let nobodi be fool __PUNCT__ if our largest __PUNCT__ best compani ar overtax and uncompetit __PUNCT__ it is the american worker who suffer __PUNCT__
now is not the time for democrat to be threaten to rais tax __PUNCT__ the economi is weak and the cost of capit ha risen alreadi __PUNCT__

we spend it to studi the dna of bear in montana __PUNCT__ without know whether we need to solv a crimin case or a patern suit __PUNCT__
we even tri to spend it to build a bridg to nowher in alaska __PUNCT__
such spend might come natur to democrat __PUNCT__ but republican promis an end to such extravag __PUNCT__
but we broke our promis __PUNCT__ and democrat exploit it in the last elect by make their own promis to voter that thei wouldn't go back to their old wai __PUNCT__

econom freedom is at the heart of our abil to transform tough time to boom time __PUNCT__
we have succeed in the past __PUNCT__ and we will do so again __PUNCT__
that freedom must includ access to market across the globe __PUNCT__
we need to build on our export strength not by build wall to intern commerc __PUNCT__ not by take a htime out __PUNCT__ from histori __PUNCT__ and not by put partisanship ahead of america prosper __PUNCT__
trade account for nearli on __PUNCT__ half of our econom growth dure the first half of thi year __PUNCT__ and help to offset the drag on our economi from the hous slump __PUNCT__

when __NUM__ percent of the world custom live outsid the unit state __PUNCT__ we need a govern that secur access to those custom for our entrepreneur __PUNCT__ their worker __PUNCT__ and the next gener __PUNCT__
it is easi to argu that american worker should take advantag of the full rang of opportun that ar avail in the global economi __PUNCT__
but let have some straight talk __PUNCT__ global is here __PUNCT__ global is an opportun __PUNCT__ but global will not automat benefit everi american __PUNCT__

sure these worker ar worthi of our concern and attent __PUNCT__ especi in an ag when displac ceo can walk awai with multi __PUNCT__ million dollar golden goodby __PUNCT__
we must remain commit to educ __PUNCT__ retrain __PUNCT__ and help for displac worker __PUNCT__ regardless of whether their job went awai becaus of trade __PUNCT__ technolog innov __PUNCT__ or shift in consum spend pattern __PUNCT__
for american who have lost a job __PUNCT__ we need to expand opportun for further educ and train that can open new door __PUNCT__
