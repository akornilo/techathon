sinc adam smith coin the phrase __PUNCT__ the invis hand __PUNCT__ economist __PUNCT__ philosoph __PUNCT__ and other have debat the virtu of market economi __PUNCT__
you even hear some presidenti candid claim to understand the finer nuanc of market and manag __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ success ha noth to do with fanci theori __PUNCT__
the simpl lesson of histori is that there is no econom forc on thi globe that is stronger than free peopl and their desir to creat a better life __PUNCT__
ronald reagan onc said that __PUNCT__ freedom is the right to question and chang the establish wai of do thing __PUNCT__
it is the continu revolut of the marketplac __PUNCT__
it is the understand that allow us to recogn shortcom and seek solut __PUNCT__
he spoke these word to univers student in moscow in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
those student thirst for freedom __PUNCT__
we ar bless by freedom __PUNCT__ but the import of protect it in everi realm is a messag that politician desper need to hear todai __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we find ourselv at a time when the u. __PUNCT__ economi is grow more slowli than anyon would like __PUNCT__
as you ar well awar __PUNCT__ condit in michigan ar even tougher __PUNCT__ with the state suffer through on of the most sever recess sinc world war ii __PUNCT__
tough time can breed fear __PUNCT__ and hillari clinton and the democrat ar us those fear to push an agenda that is tire __PUNCT__ danger __PUNCT__ and will rob us of econom freedom __PUNCT__
onc again __PUNCT__ thei want the govern to make our choic for us __PUNCT__ not respect our dream __PUNCT__ and trust our decis on how best to seiz our opportun __PUNCT__
let take stock of the situat todai in michigan __PUNCT__
unemploy is under five percent nationwid __PUNCT__ but over seven percent in michigan __PUNCT__
ten percent of michigan job have disappear thi decad and __NUM__ peopl left the state in the past year __PUNCT__
what doe the democrat governor propos to do __PUNCT__ rais tax __PUNCT__ now that will help __PUNCT__
michigan busi alreadi struggl against an unfavor cost structur __PUNCT__ and higher tax will onli make those problem wors __PUNCT__
higher tax discourag entrepreneurship __PUNCT__ foster wast tax __PUNCT__ plan __PUNCT__ inhibit econom freedom and slow long __PUNCT__ term growth __PUNCT__
i will not let the democrat roll back the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
i believ we should protect the american famili against partisan tax increas by requir a three __PUNCT__ fifth major in congress to rais tax __PUNCT__
but that is just a start __PUNCT__
our tax code is so complic it extract on thousand dollar for everi american famili __PUNCT__ a total of over __MONEY__ billion in extra cost everi year __PUNCT__
it offens that six out of everi ten taxpay have to pai someon els just to figur out how to pai the govern __PUNCT__
i want america smartest peopl creat job __PUNCT__ not wast their time __PUNCT__ energi and capit navig our incomprehens tax law __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ have on incom tax system like thi is bad enough __PUNCT__ but right now we have two of them __PUNCT__
we certainli don't need two separ tax system __PUNCT__
the altern minimum tax is expect to hit up to __NUM__ million peopl by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i am commit to repeal thi tax befor million of american famili ar forc to devot even more of their hard earn monei to pai for the spend largess in washington __PUNCT__
we can have a singl __PUNCT__ fair and simpler system built on a few __PUNCT__ lower tax rate and straightforward credit for work __PUNCT__ health __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and those with a famili __PUNCT__
we can make our person and busi tax system work cohes so that we can shed our statu as on of the least attract tax jurisdict on earth __PUNCT__
let nobodi be fool __PUNCT__ if our best compani __PUNCT__ larg or small __PUNCT__ ar overtax and uncompetit __PUNCT__ it is the american worker who suffer __PUNCT__
now is not the time for democrat to be threaten to rais tax __PUNCT__ the economi is grow too slowli and the cost of capit ha risen alreadi __PUNCT__
now is the time for us to restor american trust in their govern by control wast spend __PUNCT__
even if there is success in keep tax low __PUNCT__ michigan busi __PUNCT__ larg multin compani __PUNCT__ small busi __PUNCT__ and entrepreneur alik __PUNCT__ face a tsunami of rise health care cost __PUNCT__
it is no surpris that health care figur promin in the recent auto industri labor disput __PUNCT__
you and i both know that rise health care cost ar a threat to our global competit __PUNCT__ a threat to our famili __PUNCT__ budget __PUNCT__ a threat to our govern solvenc __PUNCT__ and a threat to the profit of american busi __PUNCT__
i applaud the recent agreement between the uaw and gm to help guarante the health benefit of retir auto worker __PUNCT__
i told the uaw/ford talk includ a similar propos to creat a trust fund for health care __PUNCT__
but my friend we must do more __PUNCT__ we must reign in the grow cost of care if we ar to compet global __PUNCT__
the american worker is the most product worker in the world __PUNCT__
thi is why mani foreign manufactur come to the unit state to build their product __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ we must be more competit in order to sustain our leadership in manufactur __PUNCT__
japan current spend half of what the u. __PUNCT__ spend on health care __PUNCT__ but thei live longer __PUNCT__
it is incred difficult to be competit if the price of everi gm car includ about __MONEY__ for health care cost befor the first wrench is turn __PUNCT__ more than the cost of the steel in the car __PUNCT__
for toyota the same cost is about __MONEY__
america ha the best health care in the world and we must work to keep it so __PUNCT__ but we must also work to provid incent to control cost and therebi make that care more access __PUNCT__
democrat want to turn health care into a govern agenc __PUNCT__
that will not mean lower cost __PUNCT__
it will not mean higher qualiti __PUNCT__
it will mean higher tax __PUNCT__ less choic and less freedom __PUNCT__
i will be talk more about health care on thursdai __PUNCT__ but i believ the debat must focu on the cost and qualiti of care __PUNCT__ or these trust fund and the compani support them mai not surviv __PUNCT__
it will requir broad __PUNCT__ base chang to focu on patient __PUNCT__ much more competit in the system __PUNCT__ and more respons of our citizensor medicar will grow unsustain __PUNCT__ and mani govern and compani will find it imposs to fund health care __PUNCT__
if we don't get cost under control __PUNCT__ the number of uninsur will continu to increas and there won't be enough monei to plug the hole __PUNCT__
we must address thi problem now to assist the grow gener of older american increasingli depend on health care and for gener to come and as presid __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__
michigan problem got wors when the state govern nearli shut down __PUNCT__ and democrat refus to make the tough choic necessari to focu spend on genuin prioriti __PUNCT__
it yet anoth sad exampl of why across thi nation taxpay have lost trust in their govern __PUNCT__
politician refus to talk straight about social secur and medicar __PUNCT__ the current social secur system is unsustain __PUNCT__
period __PUNCT__
a half centuri ago __PUNCT__ sixteen american worker support everi retire __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ it just three __PUNCT__
soon __PUNCT__ it will be onli two __PUNCT__
if we don't make some tough choic __PUNCT__ social secur and medicar either won't be there for our children and grandchildren or we will have had to rais tax so dramat to support them that we will crush the prosper of averag american __PUNCT__
i will fight to save the futur of social secur and medicar by reach my hand across the aisl __PUNCT__ but if the democrat won't act __PUNCT__ give me the respons and i will __PUNCT__
if congress won't act __PUNCT__ i will demand an up or down vote on my plan __PUNCT__
no problem is in more need of honesti than the loom insolv of our entitl program __PUNCT__
no govern program is the object of more polit postur and spin than social secur and medicar __PUNCT__
american have the right to know the truth __PUNCT__ no matter how bad it is __PUNCT__
i won't leav offic without do everyth i can to fix the fiscal problem that __PUNCT__ more than ani other __PUNCT__ threaten our futur prosper and power __PUNCT__
i am run for presid to restor the trust of taxpay in their govern __PUNCT__
american have lost trust in their govern to spend their hard earn monei wise __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the govern spend more monei than ever befor __PUNCT__
sinc ronald reagan left offic __PUNCT__ govern spend adjust for inflat ha increas __MONEY__ for everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child in the countri __PUNCT__
wast spend ha gone from irrespons to indefens __PUNCT__
when congress send a pork __PUNCT__ laden spend bill to my desk __PUNCT__ i will veto it __PUNCT__
the congress just sent to the presid a water resourc and develop act with __NUM__ earmark project __PUNCT__
if i got that bill __PUNCT__ i pull out thi pen __PUNCT__ a pen given to me by a great presid __PUNCT__ ronald reagan __PUNCT__ and i veto that bill in a heartbeat __PUNCT__
if thei kept send it to me __PUNCT__ i us the bulli pulpit to make the peopl who ar wast your monei famou __PUNCT__
you know who thei ar __PUNCT__ and you could hold them account __PUNCT__
no is alwai the right answer to wast spend __PUNCT__
i have the veto pen of ronald reagan and __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ i us it __PUNCT__
i have a reput for straight talk and we need to work togeth to increas cafe standard to a level that is practic and achiev for all new vehicl __PUNCT__ foreign and domest __PUNCT__ becaus improv fuel economi will help our nation achiev nation energi secur __PUNCT__ reduc carbon emiss __PUNCT__ and improv local and region air qualiti __PUNCT__
but as we strive to increas fuel economi __PUNCT__ we must also ensur that we maintain auto safeti __PUNCT__
i believ that the us of advanc materi and other technolog includ altern __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl __PUNCT__ flexibl __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl __PUNCT__ and plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid vehicl can help us meet our object successfulli __PUNCT__
and as the world nation take further action to reduc global warm by cut their carbon footprint __PUNCT__ the step we take now will also posit the american auto industri at the forefront in the develop and product of vehicl the world consum will demand for gener __PUNCT__
we need to be at the cut edg of green technolog becaus nineti __PUNCT__ five percent of the world custom live outsid the unit state __PUNCT__
we need to be competit as a matter of secur the futur of our children __PUNCT__
our futur prosper depend on our competit __PUNCT__
but let have on more piec of straight talk __PUNCT__ global is here __PUNCT__ global is an opportun __PUNCT__ but global will not automat benefit everi american __PUNCT__
i know that open market don't automat translat into a higher qualiti of life for everi singl american __PUNCT__
chang is hard __PUNCT__ and while most of us gain __PUNCT__ some industri __PUNCT__ compani and worker ar forc to struggl with veri difficult choic __PUNCT__
it wasn't govern job to spend million to save buggi whip factori and haberdash when car replac carriag and men stop wear hat __PUNCT__
and it isn't govern job to spend billion preserv product and servic that we can't sell anymor __PUNCT__
but it is govern job to help worker get the educ and train thei need for the new job that will be creat by new busi in thi new centuri __PUNCT__
right now we have a half __PUNCT__ dozen differ program that ar suppos to help displac worker __PUNCT__ and anoth half __PUNCT__ dozen for peopl who ar not work at all __PUNCT__
we have an unemploy insur program straight out of the 1950 __PUNCT__
it wa design to assist worker through a few tough month dure an econom downturn until their old job came back __PUNCT__
that program ha no relev to the world we live in todai __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i work with congress and the state to overhaul unemploy insur and make it a program for retrain __PUNCT__ reloc and assist worker who have lost a job that not come back to find a job that won't go awai __PUNCT__
we should replac our outmod and redund program with a singl system __PUNCT__
we can help peopl get back on their feet more quickli with job in the privat sector __PUNCT__ which offer the best train for a chang marketplac __PUNCT__
we can strengthen commun colleg and technic train __PUNCT__ and give displac worker more choic to find their wai back to product and prosper live __PUNCT__
no on should have to wait until thei ar laid off to build a better life __PUNCT__
we can start right now by improv the account of public educ at the primari and secondari level __PUNCT__ allow competit __PUNCT__ and help provid parent with choic for their children educ __PUNCT__
the better educ american ar __PUNCT__ the more capabl thei will be of adjust to and benefit from econom chang __PUNCT__
let me suggest three idea to provid american worker the continu opportun thei need to adapt to the chang econom time __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ the unemploy insur system still serv well the vast major of worker who quickli chang job in thi fluid economi __PUNCT__
but it need to be modern to meet the goal of help displac worker make end meet between job and move peopl quickli on to the next opportun __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we need to better connect train with busi knowledg and need __PUNCT__
we need to train peopl for the job that exist todai and the new job of the futur __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha a half __PUNCT__ dozen train program __PUNCT__ and no track record of success __PUNCT__
as i talk to busi peopl and educ expert i hear again and again that commun colleg do a great job of provid the right skill to worker and the right worker for firm __PUNCT__
we should take greater advantag of thi record of success __PUNCT__
and we can trust worker to choos __PUNCT__
we need to transform rigid train program to approach that can be us to meet the bill __PUNCT__ pai for train __PUNCT__ and get back to work __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ for older worker the best train mai be get back to work __PUNCT__
older worker can us their experi and work ethic to adapt to the challeng of the next job __PUNCT__
but often __PUNCT__ the start pai of the next job doesn't measur up __PUNCT__
we can help these individu honor their tradit of work and allow them to keep up with the time __PUNCT__
for those displac worker who ar __NUM__ or __NUM__ and move to a new job __PUNCT__ let give them the choic of either train or a few year of supplement to their earn so the fall is not so far __PUNCT__
thei will be less resist to take a lower pai job and we will all benefit from have their experi back on the job __PUNCT__
so todai i encourag michigan to join my effort to resist higher tax __PUNCT__ control spiral health care cost __PUNCT__ restor trust in govern __PUNCT__ and build __NUM__ centuri labor market __PUNCT__
it will work for michigan __PUNCT__
it will work for america __PUNCT__
we have much to be hope about __PUNCT__
we ar power by entrepreneur that will enhanc our global econom competit and maintain america econom leadership __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ america best dai ar still to come __PUNCT__
despit the pessim peddl by politician __PUNCT__ you can't sell me on hopeless __PUNCT__
you can't scare me about the futur __PUNCT__
you can't convinc me that our problem ar insurmount __PUNCT__
i have face advers throughout my life and with persever __PUNCT__ have overcom it __PUNCT__
i will us those lesson now to guid my resolv as presid __PUNCT__
we stand on the threshold of anoth centuri of american leadership __PUNCT__
we have the opportun to write anoth chapter of american great __PUNCT__
those of us privileg to lead thi countri need onli be mind of what ha alwai made us great __PUNCT__ have the courag to stand by our principl __PUNCT__ honor our public trust __PUNCT__ and keep our promis to put the countri interest befor our own __PUNCT__
i alwai kept my promis to my countri __PUNCT__
i keep the on i make now __PUNCT__
and i will keep the on i make as presid __PUNCT__
