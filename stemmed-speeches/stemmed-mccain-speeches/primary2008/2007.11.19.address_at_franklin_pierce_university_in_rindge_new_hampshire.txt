i know how congress work __PUNCT__ how to make it work for the countri and not just the re __PUNCT__ elect of it member __PUNCT__
i know how the world work __PUNCT__
i know the good and the evil in it __PUNCT__
i know how to work with leader who share our dream of a freer __PUNCT__ safer and more prosper world __PUNCT__ and how to stand up to those who don't __PUNCT__
i know how to fight and how to make peac __PUNCT__
if i your nomine and senat clinton is the nomine of the other parti __PUNCT__ the countri will face as clear a choic as ani in recent memori __PUNCT__
that as it should be for such an import elect __PUNCT__
she will be a formid candid __PUNCT__
and while our differ ar mani and profound __PUNCT__ i intend thi to be a respect debat __PUNCT__
she and i disagre over america direct __PUNCT__ and it is a seriou disagr __PUNCT__
but i don't doubt her abil to lead thi countri where she think it should go __PUNCT__
on matter of war and peac __PUNCT__ i offer american my experi __PUNCT__ my person familiar with the tragedi of war __PUNCT__ deep involv in all of the nation secur issu of the last two decad __PUNCT__ and steadfast convict that america cannot afford to relinquish it leadership of the world __PUNCT__ and the world can't afford it either __PUNCT__
there come a time when a presid can no longer reli on brief book and power point __PUNCT__ when the expert and advisor have all weigh in __PUNCT__ when the sum total of on life becom the foundat from which he or she make the decis that determin the cours of histori __PUNCT__
no other candid ha my experi or the judgment it inform __PUNCT__
i would never make a judgment about go to war base on whether it wa a popular thing to do __PUNCT__
i would onli make that grave decis were i convinc america interest and ideal were so threaten that it requir the greatest sacrific our countri can make __PUNCT__
and onc i decid __PUNCT__ i wouldn't surrend when we can still succe __PUNCT__ and accept the terribl consequ that would ensu __PUNCT__ becaus i fear the poll more than histori judgment __PUNCT__
senat clinton told gener petraeu that hi confid in hi new strategi and in the abil of the troop he ha the honor to command requir __PUNCT__ a will suspens of disbelief __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it becom clear that gener petraeu wa right __PUNCT__
for the time be __PUNCT__ senat clinton ha suspend her belief in the abund evid of success as her rival and the fring of her parti pull her toward a posit she know is irrespons __PUNCT__
i wa the onli candid in either parti to sai we were follow a strategi in iraq that wa doom to failur __PUNCT__ and to call for the chang that is work todai __PUNCT__
i took abus from member of my own parti __PUNCT__ some of it pretti tough __PUNCT__ for do so __PUNCT__

we can strengthen our diplomaci __PUNCT__ stand up to the russian and chines __PUNCT__ and organ our alli and iran neighbor to impos tough econom sanction that could undermin iran economi and unleash popular resent of the regim that should caus them to reconsid their danger ambit __PUNCT__
we can make it veri clear to iran leader that we will not allow them to obtain weapon that would destabil the entir middl east and threaten america most vital secur interest __PUNCT__
senat clinton would start with uncondit negoti __PUNCT__ despit iran clear record of us negoti to forestal sanction and grow intern opposit while thei acceler their nuclear program __PUNCT__
i will increas the size of the armi and marin corp __PUNCT__
for too long we have ask too few to do too much __PUNCT__

we need to recruit more american will to defend our countri __PUNCT__ and i know there ar more if we onli ask them __PUNCT__ but for reason i will never understand __PUNCT__ the former secretari of defens refus to do so __PUNCT__
to rebuild our militari as well as the capabl of our intellig and law enforc agenc __PUNCT__ and the capac of all branch of govern to defend us will requir some hard choic __PUNCT__
