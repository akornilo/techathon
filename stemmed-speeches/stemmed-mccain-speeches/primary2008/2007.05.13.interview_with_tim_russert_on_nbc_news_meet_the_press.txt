russert __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ welcom back to meet the press __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ you didn't have to sai unsuccess __PUNCT__ everybodi know that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ all part of the histori __PUNCT__
let go right to it __PUNCT__ iraq __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ we been talk to voter across the countri __PUNCT__ our nbc/wall street journal poll __PUNCT__ is victori in iraq still possibl __PUNCT__ thirti __PUNCT__ six percent sai victori possibl __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent sai victori not possibl __PUNCT__
and look at thi __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
wa the war __PUNCT__ wa the war __PUNCT__ wa it a mistak to send troop __PUNCT__ fifti __PUNCT__ eight percent sai ye __PUNCT__ a mistak __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent sai no __PUNCT__
ar you surpris at those number __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ not too __PUNCT__
particularli on the issu of the second question __PUNCT__ when we have experienc the enorm difficulti and sacrific that have been part of thi conflict that __PUNCT__ certainli __PUNCT__ you can understand that __PUNCT__
american ar frustrat __PUNCT__ and thei sadden our failur in thi conflict __PUNCT__
my point is __PUNCT__ and i sure we get into it __PUNCT__ and that is we have a chanc of success __PUNCT__ and i don't think that a lot of american ar as fulli awar as thei should be of the consequ of failur in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ when you were speak in __NUM__ the american enterpris institut __PUNCT__ you said thi __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if we can't retain the support of the american peopl __PUNCT__ we will have lost thi war as soundli as if our forc were defeat on the battlefield __PUNCT__
haven't thei lost the support of the american peopl __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think if we can show the american peopl some success in iraq and continu and expand on some of the success we alreadi experienc in anbar provinc and some neighborhood in baghdad __PUNCT__ that i think american would __PUNCT__ and if we do a better job __PUNCT__ and that peopl like me __PUNCT__ of explain the consequ of failur __PUNCT__
the consequ of failur __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ ar that there would be chao in the region __PUNCT__
there three __PUNCT__ two million sunni in baghdad __PUNCT__
the iranian would continu to increas their influenc __PUNCT__ the saudi would have to help the sunni __PUNCT__ the kurd would want independ __PUNCT__ the turk will never stand for it __PUNCT__
some peopl sai partit __PUNCT__
you have to partit bedroom in baghdad becaus sunni and shia ar __PUNCT__ ar marri __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ thi is a veri __PUNCT__ veri difficult situat __PUNCT__ but the consequ of failur __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ ar unlik the vietnam war where we could leav and come home and it wa over __PUNCT__ that these peopl will try to follow us home and the region will erupt to a point where we mai have to come back or we will be compat __PUNCT__ combat what is now __PUNCT__ to a larg degre __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ although certainli other __PUNCT__ mani other factor of sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ in the region __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in hindsight __PUNCT__ wa it a good idea to go into iraq __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ in hindsight __PUNCT__ if we had exploit the initi success __PUNCT__ which wa shock and aw __PUNCT__ and we succeed __PUNCT__ and we had done the right thing after that __PUNCT__ all of us would be applaud what we did __PUNCT__
we didn't __PUNCT__
it wa terribl mismanag __PUNCT__
it wa __PUNCT__ i went over there veri shortli after the initi victori and came back convinc that we didn't have enough troop on the ground __PUNCT__ we were make the wrong decis __PUNCT__ and that secretari rumsfeld wa badli mismanag the conflict __PUNCT__
and i spoke about it and complain for year __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ if we had succeed and done the right thing after the initi militari success __PUNCT__ then all of us would be veri happi that on of the most terribl __PUNCT__ cruel dictat in histori wa remov from power __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ becaus of our failur __PUNCT__ obvious we have paid a veri heavi price in american blood and treasur and a great sacrific __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so it wa a good idea to go in __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think at the time __PUNCT__ given the inform we had __PUNCT__
everi intellig agenc in the world __PUNCT__ not just u. __PUNCT__ believ that saddam hussein had weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
he had acquir and us them befor __PUNCT__
there wa no doubt that he wa go to acquir and us them if he could __PUNCT__
the sanction were break down __PUNCT__
the oil for food scandal wa in the billion of dollar __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ at the time __PUNCT__ given the inform we had __PUNCT__ hindsight is 20/20 __PUNCT__
if we have known we were go to experi the failur we experienc __PUNCT__ obvious it would give us all paus __PUNCT__
yet the inform and the knowledg and the situat at the time __PUNCT__ i think that it wa certainli justifi __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the pentagon quarterli report __PUNCT__ the director of the cia __PUNCT__ the director of the defens intellig agenc __PUNCT__ all have said that sectarian violenc is the problem __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ gener mapl said that al __PUNCT__ qaeda account for onli a small fraction of the insurg violenc __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ you know the __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ who our enemi __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ gener petraeu __PUNCT__ the gener on the ground __PUNCT__ doe not agre with that __PUNCT__
al __PUNCT__ qaeda is exploit these sectarian differ __PUNCT__
thei ar try to orchestr attack on both sunni and shia __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ in order to spark thi and increas thi sectarian violenc that go on __PUNCT__
al __PUNCT__ qaeda is plai significantli __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ar there problem with sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ of cours there is __PUNCT__
is there other problem __PUNCT__ such as in anbar provinc where sunni ar now combat al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ ar al __PUNCT__ qaeda be shove out of baghdad into area outsid of baghdad __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
and ar there problem in those area __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ thi is long and hard and difficult __PUNCT__ and i said it for a long time __PUNCT__
and it no last throe __PUNCT__ it no mission accomplish __PUNCT__ it no few dead __PUNCT__ ender __PUNCT__
it long and hard and tough __PUNCT__
we ar experienc some success __PUNCT__
do we have to experi more __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
but to do what the democrat want to do __PUNCT__ and that set a date for withdraw __PUNCT__ even those who oppos the war from the begin don't think that that would lead to anyth but an enorm challeng situat as a result __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ the iraqi parliament __PUNCT__ a major of the iraqi parliament __PUNCT__ ha sign a petit ask for a date certain for withdraw of american troop __PUNCT__
if the iraqi parliament want it __PUNCT__ a major in the congress want it __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ why do you stand there and sai __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ you can't have it __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ becaus it my job to give my best estim to the american peopl __PUNCT__ no matter what the polit calcul mai be __PUNCT__ as to what the best in our nation nation secur interest __PUNCT__
young men and women ar risk their live as we speak in __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__
and i know that thei will be in greater harm wai if we withdraw from iraq __PUNCT__ as we keep debat over and over and over again __PUNCT__
and i know what best __PUNCT__ in my mind __PUNCT__ in my experi __PUNCT__ in my knowledg __PUNCT__ in my inspir __PUNCT__ as to what best for thi countri __PUNCT__
so polit calcul such as poll __PUNCT__ i understand that if the american peopl don't continu to support thi effort that we will be forc to withdraw __PUNCT__
but it also my oblig to tell the american peopl and my constitu in arizona that i repres __PUNCT__ what the consequ of failur will be __PUNCT__ and i believ thei will be catastroph __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but the duli elect peopl bodi __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ congress and the iraqi parliament __PUNCT__ sai thei want a troop withdraw __PUNCT__
that more than a poll __PUNCT__
isn't that the voic of the peopl __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ as far as the iraqi parliament is concern __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern obvious doesn't feel that wai __PUNCT__ their __PUNCT__ the repres in their govern __PUNCT__
second of all __PUNCT__ there is some __PUNCT__ a certain amount of domest polit calcul involv there in what the iraqi __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ parliament __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__
the iraqi parliament ha their abil to __PUNCT__ to voic their view __PUNCT__ and i respect them __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ as i sai __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i repeat again __PUNCT__ i understand how democraci work __PUNCT__
i saw it in vietnam __PUNCT__
i saw it in vietnam __PUNCT__
and i saw it in vietnam __PUNCT__ the predict __PUNCT__ that everyth would be a worker paradis in __PUNCT__ in vietnam if we left __PUNCT__
and thousand were execut and million went to re __PUNCT__ educ camp __PUNCT__
so i __PUNCT__ i believ that __PUNCT__ that the consequ of failur __PUNCT__ and particularli sit on the larg reserv of oil thei have __PUNCT__ particularli consid the influenc of al __PUNCT__ qaeda is concern __PUNCT__ you will see enorm destabil in the region __PUNCT__ and that my duti __PUNCT__
that my oblig __PUNCT__
it not my privileg __PUNCT__
and polit calcul should not enter into ani inform or posit that i take on __PUNCT__ on a __PUNCT__ on an issu of nation secur __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the iraqi parliament sai thei want to take a two __PUNCT__ month vacat while our men and women shed their blood __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i am __PUNCT__ i am unalter oppos to it __PUNCT__
on of the real difficulti we face in thi conflict __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ is whether the maliki govern will act as an inclus govern __PUNCT__ and whether the maliki govern will do the thing that ar necessari to be done __PUNCT__
and i veri concern about it __PUNCT__
all of us ar veri concern about it __PUNCT__
thi govern ha to pass the oil revenu share law __PUNCT__
thi govern ha to pass de __PUNCT__ baathif __PUNCT__
thei have to declar elect in the provinc so that sunni __PUNCT__ who now want to take part in the elector process __PUNCT__ can have their repres __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ thei had four year to do thi __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ thei have had thi time __PUNCT__ and thei have done some thing __PUNCT__
it took us about __NUM__ and some year befor we had a bloodi civil war to decid the futur of our countri __PUNCT__
thi is a fledgl democraci __PUNCT__
i not __PUNCT__ i not make excus for it __PUNCT__ but thei have not been in thi busi befor __PUNCT__
and yet that doe not chang the fact that __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ unless thei act __PUNCT__ it could jeopard what is alreadi in jeopardi __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ would you be in favor of a referendum amongst the iraqi peopl to make a decis as to whether u. __PUNCT__ troop should stai or leav __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no more than i should __PUNCT__ would have a referendum in the unit state of america as to whether iraqi troop should leav __PUNCT__ or whether we should be in or out of nato __PUNCT__ or ani other issu __PUNCT__
the iraqi govern is an elect govern __PUNCT__ and thei ar function __PUNCT__
and so why we would need a __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ referendum __PUNCT__ is no more necessari in thi countri as in that on __PUNCT__
doe the maliki govern have to act more effect __PUNCT__ more inclus __PUNCT__ absolut thei do __PUNCT__ and it of great concern __PUNCT__ and i think it on of the great vulner as we try to move forward and succe there __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what success __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ polit and social progress __PUNCT__ which can onli be obtain in an environ of secur __PUNCT__
neighborhood in baghdad ar safer __PUNCT__
thei not safe __PUNCT__ but thei ar safer than thei were befor __PUNCT__
and the govern ha to function more effect __PUNCT__ and then the iraqi militari and polic take over those respons as we gradual withdraw __PUNCT__
that the recip for success __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the iraqi armi __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ battalion __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ yep __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ there ar onli __NUM__ battalion __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ soldier __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ ar independ work separ and apart from american __PUNCT__
how can it be __PUNCT__ after four year __PUNCT__ the iraqi onli have __NUM__ soldier oper independ __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ two thing __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ becaus the war wa so badli mismanag __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ secretari rumsfeld claim that there wa __PUNCT__ at on point __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ train __PUNCT__ and thei obvious fell apart __PUNCT__
there a differ __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ between those who can __PUNCT__ can perform __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ and those that can perform effect alongsid u. __PUNCT__ troop in baghdad and around the countri __PUNCT__
there ar __PUNCT__ there ar iraqi unit that still probabl can't stand up on their own __PUNCT__ but thei can oper effect alongsid u. __PUNCT__ militari __PUNCT__
the kei to it is __PUNCT__ will we be abl to train more who can oper independ on their own __PUNCT__ we have a wai to go __PUNCT__
but we __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ with thi new strategi __PUNCT__ and it is a strategi __PUNCT__ not a surg __PUNCT__ we have been abl to see signific improv __PUNCT__
enough improv __PUNCT__ probabl not __PUNCT__
but at least we see some progress __PUNCT__
and our command on the ground ar sai that the iraqi militari is function far more effect __PUNCT__ effect __PUNCT__ and we ar see progress there __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ jim miklaszewski __PUNCT__ our pentagon correspond __PUNCT__ report that he be told by senior militari offici that __PUNCT__ come __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we do not have the troop to continu to send to iraq in the rotat that we been __PUNCT__ that been ongo __PUNCT__
we simpli don't have them __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ come next __DATE__ __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ that correct __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ we ar increas the size of the armi and marin corp __PUNCT__
anoth on of the great fail when we began thi wa not increas the size of the armi and marin corp __PUNCT__
i said for year that we need to dramat increas them __PUNCT__ particularli in certain specialti __PUNCT__
i hope that the increas recruit that we ar experienc now will give us an opportun to increas those number __PUNCT__
i also hope that we can see some sign of success in thi challeng that we ar face __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ gener petraeu said thi __PUNCT__ ani student of histori recogn there no militari solut to a problem like that in iraq __PUNCT__ to the insurg of iraq __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i had mani convers with gener petraeu and i don't want to put word in hi mouth __PUNCT__ but he also tell you that histori show us __PUNCT__ ani student of histori will tell __PUNCT__ you that in __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ unless you have an environ of secur for the peopl to try to live normal live __PUNCT__ and the econom __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ polit and social environ is abl to grow and flourish __PUNCT__ then you ar doom to failur __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ when you sai it all we __PUNCT__ it all up to the iraqi __PUNCT__ that like sai a neighborhood that been taken over by gang __PUNCT__ it up to the peopl in the neighborhood __PUNCT__
we have to do whatev we can to provid them with an environ in which thei can exist and begin to lead normal live __PUNCT__
we ar show some success __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ the strategi befor wa __PUNCT__ go kill peopl __PUNCT__
it wa the old search __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ destroi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ go kill peopl and go back to your base __PUNCT__
we now got __NUM__ or more outpost in baghdad where iraqi and american militari ar 24/7 __PUNCT__
there ar some progress be made __PUNCT__ and gener petraeu will sai that __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
enough __PUNCT__ we see __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ it been more than four year __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and the american peopl ar sai __PUNCT__ why ar we shed our blood __PUNCT__ and thei take vacat as a parliament __PUNCT__ thei don't have independ soldier and battalion up and run __PUNCT__
our __PUNCT__ nation intellig estim __PUNCT__ outlin increasingli peril situat in which the unit state ha littl control __PUNCT__ strong possibl of further deterior __PUNCT__ accord to sourc familiar with the document __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it couch glimmer of optim in deep uncertainti about whether the iraqi leader will be abl to transcend sectarian interest __PUNCT__ fight against extremist __PUNCT__ establish effect nation institut and end rampant corrupt __PUNCT__
that our own intellig agenc __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ year out __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ and these same intellig agenc gave us some veri bad intellig about four year ago __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ as you might __PUNCT__ as you might recal __PUNCT__
but the fact __PUNCT__ the fact is __PUNCT__ thi is long __PUNCT__ hard difficult __PUNCT__
and we talk about these present challeng that we face __PUNCT__
we don't talk a lot about what happen if we fail __PUNCT__ and i think that that got to be part of ani nation discuss that we have __PUNCT__
and the consequ of failur ar chao __PUNCT__ genocid and __PUNCT__ when you __PUNCT__ when __PUNCT__ and i sure you will ask thi at some point __PUNCT__ what plan b __PUNCT__ my __PUNCT__ my __PUNCT__ my question to those who sai __PUNCT__ let set a date for withdraw __PUNCT__ what your plan b __PUNCT__ and the fact is __PUNCT__ if we spent time on plan a __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ and give it a chanc to succe __PUNCT__ i think would be a us wai of spend our time __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but under your plan __PUNCT__ you strongli suggest we go to be there for the next __NUM__ year at least in order to secur and stabil that countri __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i am suggest that we will have __PUNCT__ hopefulli reach a situat where american troop will not be on the front line __PUNCT__ where __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ that will not be immedi __PUNCT__ where american troop ar abl to withdraw __PUNCT__
we had troop in south korea for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and american ar __PUNCT__ ar veri satisfi with that situat __PUNCT__
the kei to it is __PUNCT__ is the iraqi militari and polic take over these respons __PUNCT__
and that is __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ the ultim wai we go to know whether we can reduc american casualti and thei take over the respons for __PUNCT__ for govern their own countri and militarili attack and resist al __PUNCT__ qaeda and other sectarian violenc which will be there for a long __PUNCT__ long time __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and we go to be there for a long time __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ but if it is __PUNCT__ if it is __PUNCT__ if it is onli in a role that is of support and american casualti ar minim __PUNCT__ then i think it probabl worth the invest __PUNCT__
if the level of casualti stai where it is and we do not have success __PUNCT__ then we know that that will be a __PUNCT__ a condit that we cannot stand for __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ by when __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't have a date __PUNCT__
i think that the import thing is whether we assess as we move along __PUNCT__
everybodi talk about __PUNCT__ some peopl talk about __DATE__ or mai __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__
some peopl talk about __DATE__ __PUNCT__
the fact is that we got to be show progress along the wai __PUNCT__ and we will be __PUNCT__ have plenti of time to assess that __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i understand you __PUNCT__ you ar voic the frustrat that american feel __PUNCT__
we onli got four of the five brigad over there now __PUNCT__
we have just begun thi new strategi __PUNCT__
it is bare begin __PUNCT__ and i think it ought to be given a chanc to succe or fail __PUNCT__
and for us to __PUNCT__ to go for two month of fund after we vote time and time again __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__ the presid ha veto __PUNCT__ and we continu to __PUNCT__ to try to micromanag thi war __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and if you want us out of there __PUNCT__ then cut off the fund and bring them home tomorrow __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ let me show you the kind of thing that ar often said when soldier ar oversea __PUNCT__ like thi __PUNCT__ there no reason for the unit state to remain __PUNCT__
the american peopl want them home __PUNCT__
i believ the major of congress want them home __PUNCT__
our continu militari presenc allow anoth situat to rise __PUNCT__ which could then lead to the wound __PUNCT__ kill or captur of american fight men and women __PUNCT__
we should do all in our power to avoid that __PUNCT__
what should be the criteria is our immedi __PUNCT__ orderli withdraw __PUNCT__
and if we do not do that and other american die then i __PUNCT__ sai that the respons for that lie with the congress who did not exercis their author under the constitut __PUNCT__
for us to get into nation __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__ law and order __PUNCT__ etc __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ is a tragic and terribl mistak __PUNCT__
you hear those kind of word __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ sure i do __PUNCT__
american ar frustrat and sadden by the enorm sacrific we made and the gross mismanag of the war __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my respons to that statement is and what happen after we leav __PUNCT__ listen to all of the expert who will tell you that we can have a situat in the region which will __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ in the long run __PUNCT__ entail far greater casualti __PUNCT__ far greater disloc __PUNCT__ far greater threat to our nation secur than try to give thi an opportun to succe __PUNCT__
that what the __PUNCT__ my respons to that heartfelt statement is __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ those ar your word from __NUM__ about somalia __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and that the kind of thing we hear about iraq __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you felt that wai about somalia when you saw no end in sight __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and mani american now ar echo your word about iraq __PUNCT__ becaus thei see no end in sight __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if you compar __PUNCT__ want to compar somalia to what at stake in iraq __PUNCT__ pleas feel free to do so __PUNCT__
i don't see ani comparison except that there wa chao in the street of mogadishu __PUNCT__ and thi now is got to do with vital nation secur interest __PUNCT__
i also said that we should get out of beirut when we did __PUNCT__ becaus a __PUNCT__ a presenc of a few marin in a barrack wa not go to __PUNCT__ in ani wai __PUNCT__ significantli impact what wa go on in lebanon __PUNCT__
and i wa right __PUNCT__ and a lot of young marin di becaus we __PUNCT__ of the wai that we put a presenc in there without ani chanc of success __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you sai we make progress __PUNCT__
you been on thi program talk about iraq __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ said __PUNCT__ i believ we achiev signific goal __PUNCT__ __NUM__ we view it as __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ hope __PUNCT__ we make __PUNCT__ progress __PUNCT__ __NUM__ we on the __PUNCT__ right track __PUNCT__ i want to emphas again __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ good thing happen __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ show sign of success __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it upbeat __PUNCT__ upbeat __PUNCT__ upbeat __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and yet the realiti is quit differ than that kind of optimist messag __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i think it would be fair also to put the statement that i made when i came back from iraq that said it wa a fail polici __PUNCT__ that we had to have more troop on the ground __PUNCT__ that we were not carri out the right kind of effort at train and equip the iraqi __PUNCT__ that the iraqi govern wasn't __PUNCT__ so it might be fair to flash some of those statement up __PUNCT__ includ the long speech i gave __PUNCT__ after i came back from iraq __PUNCT__ to the council on foreign relat __PUNCT__ where i said if we pursu thi fail polici __PUNCT__ we will fail in iraq __PUNCT__
so i think that that might balanc it out a bit __PUNCT__
do i think we had __PUNCT__ we had made some progress __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
and do i think that we have had some signific setback __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ both is __PUNCT__ ar the case __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you made a lot of new back in __DATE__ when you went to iraq __PUNCT__
you went on a radio show and said never __PUNCT__ had a new confer __PUNCT__ never been abl to go out in the citi as i wa todai __PUNCT__
and then later these photograph were releas __PUNCT__ where we saw __PUNCT__ clear throat __PUNCT__ excus me __PUNCT__ john mccain in the marketplac __PUNCT__ surround __PUNCT__ wear a flack jacket __PUNCT__

that convers wa in the context of we have to help young women who ar experienc a crisi pregnanc __PUNCT__

and we also have to do whatev we can to let them know that if thei don't want the child __PUNCT__ if thei bring them into life __PUNCT__ that we do everyth we can to help with adopt __PUNCT__

russert __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ you chose not to enter the iowa caucus __PUNCT__

mccain __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i am of the confirm belief that when oil is __NUM__ __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__ that ethanol doe not make sens __PUNCT__
when oil is __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__ then ethanol doe make sens __PUNCT__
i still oppos the subsidi to it __PUNCT__
it make a lot of sens __PUNCT__
we ar depend on foreign oil too much __PUNCT__
we have a situat where greenhous gase ha now becom __PUNCT__ emiss ha becom a vital issu __PUNCT__
i am for sugarcan __PUNCT__ biofuel __PUNCT__ switch grass __PUNCT__ and corn __PUNCT__ base ethanol becaus of our need for independ on foreign oil __PUNCT__
and it ha becom far more graphic and dramat as we watch peopl like mr __PUNCT__ chavez in venezuela behav the wai that he ha __PUNCT__ and presid putin behav the wai that he doe __PUNCT__
it a fact that when oil is low amount per barrel and __PUNCT__ that we ar not concern about greenhous gase or depend upon foreign oil __PUNCT__ it doesn't make the sens that it make todai __PUNCT__
it doe make sens todai __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you do now disagre with what you said in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ that it ha noth to do with reduc fuel consumpt __PUNCT__

the air qualiti __PUNCT__ it doe reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__
most effect __PUNCT__ doe __PUNCT__ as much as nuclear power __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
but given our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ given the situat as the price of oil then __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and the realiti of climat chang __PUNCT__ we should go for mani altern fuel __PUNCT__
i do not support the subsidi __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so you chang your mind __PUNCT__

the realiti todai ar that we have a seriou problem with climat chang __PUNCT__ which i have been concern about for mani year __PUNCT__ and we have a far more seriou challeng as associ with our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
not too long ago __PUNCT__ a year or so ago __PUNCT__ there wa an attempt attack on a saudi oil refineri __PUNCT__
if that attack had succeed __PUNCT__ the price of oil would have gone to __MONEY__ a barrel overnight __PUNCT__
