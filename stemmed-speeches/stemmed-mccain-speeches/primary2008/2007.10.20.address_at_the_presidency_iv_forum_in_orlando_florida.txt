we don't hide from histori __PUNCT__
we make histori __PUNCT__
three decad ago __PUNCT__ a visionari politician __PUNCT__ a man of firm convict and an abid respect for the valu and strength of hi countri __PUNCT__ describ the danger in the world __PUNCT__
it wa __PUNCT__ like todai __PUNCT__ a time when some doubt america good and great __PUNCT__
mani argu for reconcili with our global adversari __PUNCT__
but thi man held firm __PUNCT__
he did not care what editori board wrote about him __PUNCT__
he did what he thought wa right __PUNCT__
he critic a foreign polici of weak and vacil __PUNCT__
he call for resolv and firm in deal with the soviet union __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ he refus to condemn million to perpetu communist tyranni in the fals hope that accommod the soviet union would contribut to america secur __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ thi man becam presid __PUNCT__
how differ would our live be had ronald reagan not won elect in __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ doe anyon believ a democrat presid would have call the soviet union an __PUNCT__ evil empir __PUNCT__ or would have stood up to the nuclear freez movement __PUNCT__ would have promis that commun would be left on the ash heap of histori __PUNCT__ would have demand that a soviet leader tear down the berlin wall __PUNCT__ while hi critic and oppon tri to hide from histori __PUNCT__
ronald reagan summon us to make histori __PUNCT__ to make anoth __PUNCT__ better world __PUNCT__ where our interest were secur __PUNCT__ and our valu ascend __PUNCT__
he wa steadfast in the face of fierc critic __PUNCT__ intern irresolut and determin adversari __PUNCT__
and he wa right __PUNCT__
we won the cold war as we will win thi new and danger war __PUNCT__ on our term __PUNCT__ for the sake of all human __PUNCT__ for the right of free peopl to live without fear __PUNCT__ and with the promis of anoth __PUNCT__ better wo rld secur and within our reach __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the challeng ar at least as sever as thei were when ronald reagan led us __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ the differ between republican and democrat on nation secur ar everi bit as stark __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ lead democrat presidenti candid vote against fund for our troop engag in war in afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ lead democrat presidenti candid question whether there is a war on terror __PUNCT__ offer to enter into uncondit negoti with our worst enemi __PUNCT__ and talk about counter the forc of radic by advoc surrend to them in iraq __PUNCT__
if the democrat get their wai in iraq __PUNCT__ if we cede iraq to al qaeda __PUNCT__ death squad and iran and syria __PUNCT__ how long will thei stai the cours in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we face grave challeng in the middl east __PUNCT__ halt iran nuclear ambit __PUNCT__ protect our democrat alli __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__ support moder voic against the killer of hama and hezbollah __PUNCT__ defend lebanon sovereignti against syrian and iranian aggress __PUNCT__
doe anyon serious believ that we can better meet those challeng in the aftermath of an american defeat in iraq __PUNCT__ it is irrespons to think so __PUNCT__ and ani man or woman who doe isn't prepar to lead our countri in thi critic hour __PUNCT__
the world ronald regan face wa a danger on __PUNCT__ but more stabl than the world todai __PUNCT__
it wa a world where we confront a massiv __PUNCT__ organ threat to our secur __PUNCT__
our enemi wa evil __PUNCT__ but not irrat __PUNCT__
and for all the suffer endur by captiv nation __PUNCT__ for all the fear of global nuclear war __PUNCT__ it wa a world made fairli predict by a stabl balanc of power until our steadfast and patienc yield an histor victori for our secur and ideal __PUNCT__
that world is gone __PUNCT__ and pleas don't mistak my reminisc as an indic that i miss it __PUNCT__
that world __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ had much cruelti and terror __PUNCT__ some of which it wa my fate to wit person __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we face an enemi that so despis us and modern itself that thei would us ani mean __PUNCT__ unleash ani terror __PUNCT__ caus the most unimagin suffer to harm us __PUNCT__ and to destroi the world we have tri throughout our histori to build __PUNCT__
but we ar american __PUNCT__ and we still have it in our power to make histori __PUNCT__ a histori in which all peopl might somedai share in the bless and respons of freedom __PUNCT__
let us accept the challeng that histori ha assign to us __PUNCT__ brave __PUNCT__ confid in our ideal and purpos __PUNCT__ and sure of our strength __PUNCT__
war is a terribl thing __PUNCT__ but not the worst thing __PUNCT__
our militari men and women have endur the danger and depriv of war so that the worst thing would not befal us __PUNCT__ so that america might be secur in her freedom __PUNCT__
the war in iraq ha divid the american peopl __PUNCT__ but it ha divid no american in our admir for the men and women who ar fight for us there __PUNCT__
it is everi veteran hope that should their children be call upon to answer a call to arm __PUNCT__ the battl will be necessari and the field well chosen __PUNCT__
but that is not their respons __PUNCT__
it belong to the govern that call them __PUNCT__
as it onc wa for us __PUNCT__ their honor will be in their answer not their summon __PUNCT__
whatev we think about how and why we went to war in iraq __PUNCT__ we ar all __PUNCT__ those who support the decis that place them in harm wai and those who oppos it __PUNCT__ humbl by and grate for their exampl __PUNCT__
thei now deserv the distinct o f the best american __PUNCT__ and we ow them a debt we can never fulli repai __PUNCT__
we can onli offer the small tribut of our humil and our commit to do all that we can do __PUNCT__ in less try and costli circumst __PUNCT__ to help keep thi nation worthi of their sacrific for us and for the world __PUNCT__
it is a privileg beyond measur to live in a countri that ha sacrif so much for the caus of freedom __PUNCT__
i have live a long __PUNCT__ event and bless life __PUNCT__
i have had the good fortun to know person a great mani brave and selfless patriot who sacrif and shed blood to defend america __PUNCT__
but i have known none braver or better than those who do so todai __PUNCT__
thei ar my inspir __PUNCT__
and i prai to a love god that he bless and protect them __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
