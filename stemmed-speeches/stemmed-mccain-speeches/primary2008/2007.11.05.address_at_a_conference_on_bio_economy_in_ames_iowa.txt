i pleas to be here and grate for thi opportun to share with you my view about the import of iowa to our economi and how i believ iowa economi is well situat to take advantag of increas in the global trade of good and servic __PUNCT__
i enjoi get better acquaint with iowa thi year __PUNCT__ and i learn a lot __PUNCT__
i learn that while iowa take great pride in it tradit of famili farm __PUNCT__ it also ha a larg manufactur base __PUNCT__ and rank in the top ten of our fastest grow export state __PUNCT__
that an encourag statist for iowa becaus __PUNCT__ irrespect of the sporad rise of protectionist sentiment in thi countri __PUNCT__ open new market for american good and servic is indispens to our futur prosper __PUNCT__ and those state best prepar to seiz the opportun of the global economi will prosper most __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ we can compet with anyon __PUNCT__
you wouldn't know that by listen to the protectionist __PUNCT__
thei think we lic ked __PUNCT__
thei think we should hide behind wall __PUNCT__ and hope we have enough left to live on while the world pass us by __PUNCT__
that not leadership __PUNCT__ and that not american __PUNCT__
mani iowan have heard that i oppos feder subsidi for ethanol product __PUNCT__
some of you will have heard that i oppos a protect tariff against sugar __PUNCT__ base ethanol import from place like brazil __PUNCT__
some of my oppon will describ my posit as opposit to american ethanol produc or __PUNCT__ for some inexplic reason __PUNCT__ a person dislik of iowa __PUNCT__
neither is true __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ and i appreci the opportun to set the record straight __PUNCT__
but i have alwai believ befor you can win someon vote __PUNCT__ you have to earn their respect __PUNCT__
and i intend to earn your respect by be honest with you __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ i oppos subsidi __PUNCT__
not just ethanol subsidi __PUNCT__
subsidi __PUNCT__
and not just in iowa either __PUNCT__
i oppos them in my own state of arizona __PUNCT__
i am a proud of the conserv tradit that the govern can sometim best serv the interest of the american peopl by know when to stai out of their wai __PUNCT__
and i alwai been reluct to grow the size of govern to do the busi of the american peopl for them or to favor on industri over anoth or becaus on sector of our economi ha better lobbyist than anoth __PUNCT__
i want the govern to do it job __PUNCT__ not your job __PUNCT__ to do it better and to do it with less of your monei __PUNCT__
i want our economi to grow __PUNCT__ not the size of govern __PUNCT__
and i don't want govern to divert resourc from the grow industri that hold the kei to america continu econom success __PUNCT__
excess and intrus regul undermin the flexibl need for busi success __PUNCT__
there is no econom forc on thi globe that is stronger than free peopl __PUNCT__
entrepreneur lie at the heart of innov __PUNCT__ growth __PUNCT__ and advanc prosper __PUNCT__
entrepreneur should not be shackl by excess regul that rais the cost of busi __PUNCT__
entrepreneur should not be disadvantag by earmark and pork __PUNCT__ barrel spend that favor polit connect competitor __PUNCT__
i trust american __PUNCT__ i trust market and i oppos subsidi __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i propos a nation energi strategi that will amount to a declar of independ from the risk bred by our relianc on petro __PUNCT__ dictat and our vulner to the troubl polit of the land thei rule __PUNCT__
that strategi won't be anoth grab bag of handout to thi or that industri and a full employ act for lobbyist __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ that mean no ethanol subsidi __PUNCT__
but it also mean no rifl __PUNCT__ shot tax break for big oil __PUNCT__
it mean no line item for hydrogen __PUNCT__ no mandat for other renew fuel __PUNCT__ and no big __PUNCT__ govern debacl like the dakota synfuel plant __PUNCT__
it mean ethanol entrepreneur get a level plai field to make their case __PUNCT__ and earn their profit __PUNCT__
i believ thi approach allow iowan their best opportun to displai to the world the ingenu that ha serv iowa through the year __PUNCT__
iowan were the leader in agricultur advanc __PUNCT__ conserv and land stewardship __PUNCT__
iowa gave us ding darl __PUNCT__ the father of the feder duck stamp whose action were essenti to the genesi of the nation wildlif refug land conserv program __PUNCT__
max mcgraw wa instrument in advanc the transport of electr __PUNCT__ which result in the develop of electr power as a major sourc of energi __PUNCT__
he also wa a champion of industri and land conserv __PUNCT__
iowan __PUNCT__ through their abil __PUNCT__ their fine univers __PUNCT__ and their tradit of hard work and innov will transform the energi and agricultur busi in america and make us an even more success competitor on the world stage __PUNCT__
thei will best do thi unencumb with ill __PUNCT__ advis govern subsidi that serv in the end to restrict competit ion __PUNCT__ stifl technolog advanc and restrain american __PUNCT__ natur entrepreneuri drive __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i will chang the competit landscap and final give iowan a fair chanc and no need for exist subsidi __PUNCT__
i have propos a market __PUNCT__ base approach that would set reason cap on carbon and other greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ and provid industri with tradabl credit __PUNCT__
by reduc it emiss __PUNCT__ a util or industri plant can gener credit it mai trade on the open market for a profit __PUNCT__ offer a power incent to drive the deploy of new and better energi sourc and technolog __PUNCT__
thi approach will build the busi case for altern to oil such as ethanol __PUNCT__
it will promot the conserv and diversif of energi to includ alcohol fuel made from corn __PUNCT__ sugar __PUNCT__ switchgrass and mani other sourc __PUNCT__ fuel cell __PUNCT__ biodiesel deriv from wast product __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ and other technolog __PUNCT__
these ar all promis and avail altern to oil __PUNCT__ and i encourag the develop of infrastructur and the market growth necessari for these product to compet __PUNCT__ and let consum choos the winner __PUNCT__
i never known an american entrepreneur worthi of the name who wouldn't rather compet for sale than subsidi __PUNCT__
