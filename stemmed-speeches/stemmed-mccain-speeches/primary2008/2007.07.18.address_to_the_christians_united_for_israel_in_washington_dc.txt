thank you for the honor of speak befor thi gather __PUNCT__ and thank you for the work you do in support of the state of israel __PUNCT__
your effort ar need todai more than ever __PUNCT__ as it is harder to think of a time in recent memori when israel nation secur ha face so mani vari challeng __PUNCT__
the jewish state ha __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ experienc tough time befor __PUNCT__ inde __PUNCT__ thei have perhap been the norm rather than the except __PUNCT__
when on think back over the conflict __PUNCT__ __NUM__ the six dai war __PUNCT__ yom kippur __PUNCT__ lebanon __PUNCT__ the first gulf war __PUNCT__ two intifada and lebanon again __PUNCT__ it is clear that israel ha been challeng more __PUNCT__ in less time __PUNCT__ than ani nation on earth __PUNCT__
surviv in the face of such trial would be impress __PUNCT__ flourish would seem out of the question __PUNCT__
yet israel ha thrive __PUNCT__
i would like to believ that israel success ha been aid by america __PUNCT__ israel natur partner and alli __PUNCT__ and by it support here and the world over __PUNCT__ sever thousand of which ar here todai __PUNCT__
but the test continu __PUNCT__ with hama and hezbollah __PUNCT__ in the anti __PUNCT__ semit so pervas in the arab press __PUNCT__ in the restiv violenc in iraq and elsewher __PUNCT__ and in the vile threat issu routin by the iranian presid __PUNCT__
but israel will surviv __PUNCT__
just as it ha thrive in the face of armi and terrorist __PUNCT__ just as it ha prosper in the most danger neighborhood on earth __PUNCT__ so will it succe in the face of todai threat __PUNCT__
there will alwai __PUNCT__ alwai be an israel __PUNCT__
and just as there will alwai be a proud __PUNCT__ strong israel __PUNCT__ so too will there alwai be a close and endur u.s. __PUNCT__ israel relationship __PUNCT__
when it come to the defens of israel __PUNCT__ we simpli cannot compromis __PUNCT__
in view of the increas threat to isra secur __PUNCT__ american support for israel should intensifi __PUNCT__ to includ provid need militari equip and technolog and ensur that israel maintain it qualit militari edg __PUNCT__
israel enemi ar too numer __PUNCT__ it margin of error too small __PUNCT__ and our share interest and valu too great for ani other posit __PUNCT__
israel strength will be put to the test __PUNCT__
the world chief state sponsor of intern terror __PUNCT__ iran __PUNCT__ defin itself by hostil to israel and the unit state __PUNCT__
it is simpli tragic that millennia of proud persian histori have culmin in a govern todai that cannot be count among those of the world civil nation __PUNCT__
when the presid of iran call for israel to be wipe off of the map __PUNCT__ or ask for a world without zionism __PUNCT__ or suggest that israel jewish popul return to europ __PUNCT__ or call the holocaust a myth __PUNCT__ it is clear that we ar deal with an evil man and a veri danger regim __PUNCT__
tehran continu pursuit of nuclear weapon clearli pose an unaccept risk __PUNCT__
protect by a nuclear arsen __PUNCT__ iran would feel unconstrain to sponsor terrorist attack against ani perceiv enemi __PUNCT__
it flout of the nuclear nonprolifer treati would render that regim obsolet __PUNCT__ and could induc turkei __PUNCT__ egypt __PUNCT__ saudi arabia and other to reassess their defens postur __PUNCT__
moder gulf state would have to accommod the new realiti __PUNCT__ and the world would live __PUNCT__ indefinit __PUNCT__ with the possibl that tehran might pass nuclear materi or weapon to on of it alli terrorist network __PUNCT__
coupl with it ballist missil arsen __PUNCT__ an iranian nuclear capabl would pose an immedi and existenti threat to the state of israel __PUNCT__
un secur council action is requir to impos progress tougher polit and econom sanction __PUNCT__
should the secur council continu to drag it feet __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ must lead a group of like __PUNCT__ mind countri in impos multilater sanction outsid the un framework __PUNCT__
iran need to import refin gasolin __PUNCT__ to cite on exampl __PUNCT__ suggest an import vulner __PUNCT__
and countri such as china and malaysia __PUNCT__ which have sign deal to develop iranian ga field __PUNCT__ and russia __PUNCT__ which provid weapon system to tehran __PUNCT__ should know that iran will be a critic element in american bilater relat with each nation __PUNCT__
in the meantim __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ should immedi investig whether ani of these deal violat the term of last year iran freedom support act __PUNCT__
the u. __PUNCT__ should also privat the sanction effort by launch a disinvest campaign __PUNCT__
by persuad individu __PUNCT__ pension fund __PUNCT__ and financi institut to divest from compani do busi with iran __PUNCT__ we can isol and delegitim a hostil govern __PUNCT__
we will also __PUNCT__ as we did with the south africa disinvest campaign __PUNCT__ increas the debat insid the countri about whether the present cours serv the interest of the iranian peopl or mere those of a misguid elit __PUNCT__
american and all propon of freedom need to reassur the million of iranian who aspir to self __PUNCT__ determin that we support their long for freedom and democraci __PUNCT__
and everi option must remain on the tabl __PUNCT__
militari action isn't our prefer __PUNCT__
it remain __PUNCT__ as it alwai must __PUNCT__ the last option __PUNCT__
we have some wai to go diplomat befor we need to contempl other measur __PUNCT__
but it is a simpl observ of realiti that there is onli on thing wors than a militari solut __PUNCT__ and that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is a nuclear arm iran __PUNCT__
the regim must understand that it cannot win a showdown with the world __PUNCT__
similarli __PUNCT__ the leadership of hama must be isol __PUNCT__
the palestinian peopl ar ill __PUNCT__ serv by a terrorist __PUNCT__ led govern that refus to recogn israel right to exist __PUNCT__ refus to renounc violenc __PUNCT__ and refus to acknowledg prior peac commit __PUNCT__
the unit state cannot have normal relat with such a govern __PUNCT__ on that deliber target innoc isra civilian in an attempt to terror the jewish popul __PUNCT__
the recent talk between the isra govern and the govern led by presid mahmoud abba in the west bank ar encourag __PUNCT__ and the unit state should support thi effort __PUNCT__
we also must ensur that israel peopl can live in safeti until a palestinian leadership truli commit to peac emerg __PUNCT__
no moral nation __PUNCT__ neither israel nor america __PUNCT__ can allow terrorist to chart the polit cours of it peopl __PUNCT__
and to speak of terror is also to speak of hezbollah __PUNCT__
israel chanc for endur peac with lebanon resid in a govern that ha a monopoli on author within it countri __PUNCT__
that mean no independ militia __PUNCT__ no hezbollah fighter __PUNCT__ no weapon and equip flow to hezbollah __PUNCT__
yet neither the lebanes armi nor the intern forc there is prepar or will to take on hezbollah __PUNCT__
so long as that is the case __PUNCT__ the current paus is like to enabl hezbollah to regroup __PUNCT__ reconstitut __PUNCT__ and rearm __PUNCT__
there is on bottom line __PUNCT__ to achiev last peac __PUNCT__ sooner or later __PUNCT__ on wai or anoth __PUNCT__ hezbollah must be disarm __PUNCT__
now let me turn briefli to iraq __PUNCT__
we have made a great mani mistak in thi war __PUNCT__ and both baghdad and washington remain divid about how to correct them __PUNCT__
the situat in iraq is veri difficult __PUNCT__ and the temptat is to wash our hand of a messi situat __PUNCT__
to follow thi impuls __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ portend catastroph __PUNCT__ for iraq __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__ and the unit state __PUNCT__
becaus a precipit american withdraw risk all __PUNCT__ out civil war and the emerg of a fail state in the heart of the middl east __PUNCT__ invit intervent from iraq neighbor and the potenti for region __PUNCT__ wide conflict __PUNCT__ we must do all in our power to prevail __PUNCT__
thi mean support gener petraeu as he lead our troop in counterinsurg oper design to clear area of terrorist and bring secur to the popul __PUNCT__
it also mean press the maliki govern to make polit progress __PUNCT__ which ha been sore lack __PUNCT__
the iraqi govern must seiz the opportun that ha been provid it by the __PUNCT__ surg __PUNCT__ in u. __PUNCT__ forc and make bold step on reconcili __PUNCT__
it will not come around again __PUNCT__
prevent iraq from fall into the hand of terrorist and extremist is onli natur for the unit state __PUNCT__ and spring from the same interest and valu that compel our close relationship with the state of israel __PUNCT__
violent islam extremist would have us believ that there is onli on accept religi practic __PUNCT__ and that those who diverg from it ar not entitl to life or liberti __PUNCT__
thei ar wrong __PUNCT__ veri __PUNCT__ veri wrong __PUNCT__
if america stand for anyth __PUNCT__ it stand for the freedom to follow our own mind and heart __PUNCT__ to determin our own relationship with god __PUNCT__
i did not realiz just how preciou thi freedom is until it wa taken awai __PUNCT__
as some in thi audienc mai know __PUNCT__ i spent sever year as a prison of war __PUNCT__ a time when all my freedom were rescind __PUNCT__
and yet it wa my veri faith in a suprem be that sustain me and strengthen me while at the hand of my captor __PUNCT__
our founder built in thi nation an amaz thing __PUNCT__ a democraci that guarante the right of everi citizen to worship god in the wai that thei choos __PUNCT__
we must protect that freedom here in our own countri by ensur that judg do not legisl from the bench to remov religion from the public squar of our commun __PUNCT__
and we must support it expans abroad by stand with those whom __PUNCT__ becaus of their religion and their valu __PUNCT__ come under threat __PUNCT__
it is evid that i am speak __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ of israel __PUNCT__
the bond between america and israel is not just a strateg on __PUNCT__ though that is import __PUNCT__
the more profound tie between our two countri is a moral on __PUNCT__
we ar two democraci whose allianc is forg in our common valu __PUNCT__
to be proudli pro __PUNCT__ american and pro __PUNCT__ isra is not to hold conflict loyalti __PUNCT__
it is about defend the principl that both countri hold dear __PUNCT__
that is why todai i stand as i believ so mani of you do __PUNCT__ a christian __PUNCT__ proudli pro __PUNCT__ american and proudli pro __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__
