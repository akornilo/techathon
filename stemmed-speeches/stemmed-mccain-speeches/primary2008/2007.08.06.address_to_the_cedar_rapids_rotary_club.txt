thank you __PUNCT__
the unit state of america __PUNCT__ histori most success polit experi __PUNCT__ ha prove that a nation conceiv in liberti will prove stronger __PUNCT__ more decent and endur than ani nation order to exalt the few at the expens of the mani or made from a common race or cultur or to preserv tradit that have no greater attribut than longev __PUNCT__
our war with radic islam extremist ha been wrongli describ as a clash of civil __PUNCT__
it is a clash of ideal __PUNCT__ not civil __PUNCT__ a profound and huge consequenti clash of ideal __PUNCT__
it is a fight between right and wrong __PUNCT__ in which relativ should have no place __PUNCT__
we ar defend our secur and ideal from an attack by those who consid liberti immor __PUNCT__
we not defend an idea that everi human be should eat corn flake __PUNCT__ plai basebal or watch mtv __PUNCT__
we not insist that all societi be govern by a bicamer legislatur and a term __PUNCT__ limit chief execut __PUNCT__
we ar insist that all peopl have a god __PUNCT__ given right to be free __PUNCT__ and that right is not subject to the whim and interest and author of anoth person __PUNCT__ govern or cultur __PUNCT__
and central to our ideal is the sanctiti of properti right __PUNCT__
without privat properti there can be no freedom __PUNCT__ and without freedom there can be no america __PUNCT__
properti __PUNCT__ john adam wrote __PUNCT__ is sure a right of mankind as real as liberti __PUNCT__
yet todai properti right come under attack from regul that affect everi conceiv aspect of properti ownership __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ adam would be shock to learn what both the unit state suprem court and the suprem court of connecticut did to susett kelo __PUNCT__ an american homeown __PUNCT__ in allow the govern to seiz her home for econom develop and gain under the guis of __PUNCT__ valid public us __PUNCT__
the protect of properti right li at the heart of our constitut system __PUNCT__
the framer of our constitut drew upon classic notion of legal right and individu liberti date back to the justinian code __PUNCT__ the magna carta __PUNCT__ and the two treatis of john lock __PUNCT__ all of which recogn the import of properti ownership in a government system in which individu liberti and the free market ar paramount __PUNCT__
properti is more than just land __PUNCT__
properti is build __PUNCT__ machin __PUNCT__ apart leas __PUNCT__ retir save account __PUNCT__ check account __PUNCT__ furnitur __PUNCT__ comput __PUNCT__ car __PUNCT__ and even idea __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ properti is the fruit of on labor __PUNCT__
properti right protect mean that the individu reap the reward from the sweat of hi brow __PUNCT__ not the govern or those who control the govern __PUNCT__
our economi is built on the labor of american worker and fuel by the dream of innov and entrepreneur __PUNCT__
without secur privat properti __PUNCT__ the incent that have made america the greatest export __PUNCT__ import __PUNCT__ produc __PUNCT__ saver __PUNCT__ investor __PUNCT__ manufactur __PUNCT__ and innov on the globe would whither __PUNCT__
thi insight ha produc a revolut in develop strategi around the globe __PUNCT__
after decad of liter throw monei at the problem of global poverti __PUNCT__ the emphasi ha switch to secur properti right __PUNCT__ buttress the rule of law and allow the world worker to profit from their labor and retain it reward __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ where the fruit of on labor ar own by the state and not the individu __PUNCT__ peopl ar powerless __PUNCT__
as noah webster explain __PUNCT__ let the peopl have properti and thei will have power a power that will forev be exert to prevent the restrict of the press __PUNCT__ the abolit of trial by juri __PUNCT__ or the abridg of mani other privileg __PUNCT__
in sharp contrast __PUNCT__ karl marx wrote in the communist manifesto __PUNCT__ the theori of the communist mai be sum up in a singl sentenc __PUNCT__ abolit of privat properti __PUNCT__
the govern disrespect for properti right __PUNCT__ in the form of taxat without represent and the seiz of privat home for troop without permiss or compens __PUNCT__ wa the motiv forc behind our struggl to obtain independ __PUNCT__
and in the year after achiev independ __PUNCT__ the founder ensur that the properti right for which thei fought were protect by our constitut __PUNCT__
thei recogn that liberti and properti right ar insepar __PUNCT__
as jame madison state __PUNCT__ it is suffici obviou __PUNCT__ that person and properti ar the two great subject on which govern ar to act __PUNCT__ and that the right of person __PUNCT__ and the right of properti __PUNCT__ ar the object __PUNCT__ for the protect of which govern wa institut __PUNCT__
on of the most visibl protect for properti right is the just compens claus of the fifth amend of the unit state constitut __PUNCT__ which state __PUNCT__ nor shall privat properti be taken for public us __PUNCT__ without just compens __PUNCT__
the purpos of the just compens claus __PUNCT__ as interpret by the suprem court in armstrong v __PUNCT__ unit state __PUNCT__ is __PUNCT__ to bar govern from forc some peopl to bear public burden __PUNCT__ which in all fair and justic __PUNCT__ should be born by the public as a whole __PUNCT__
some local govern have sought to stretch their emin domain power as a mean of augment revenu by expand their tax base __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ the america of the late twentieth and earli twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri ha wit an explos of govern regul that have jeopard privat ownership of properti __PUNCT__ often for question purpos that have littl to do with the limit type of public us envis by the framer of our constitut __PUNCT__
the need to protect privat properti right __PUNCT__ onc so obviou to madison and adam is now becom lost in a tangl of intrus govern take __PUNCT__
nowher ha thi been truer than in the disastr decis issu in __NUM__ by the u. __PUNCT__ suprem court in kelo v __PUNCT__ citi of new london __PUNCT__
in kelo __PUNCT__ the suprem court held that held that the constitut allow govern to seiz privat properti and transfer it from on privat land owner to anoth in the name of econom develop __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ after the kelo decis __PUNCT__ govern can us their emin domain power to take home for potenti more profit __PUNCT__ higher __PUNCT__ tax us __PUNCT__ power evid __PUNCT__ as justic clarenc thoma suggest __PUNCT__ that someth is serious awri with the suprem court vision of the constitut __PUNCT__
justic sandra dai o'connor frame the problem veri simpli in her blister dissent opinion __PUNCT__ under the banner of econom develop __PUNCT__ all privat properti is now vulner to be taken and transfer to anoth privat owner __PUNCT__ so long as it might be upgrad i. __PUNCT__ given to an owner who will us it in a wai that the legislatur deem more benefici to the public in the process __PUNCT__
thi decis went well beyond what the founder intend when thei wrote the just compens for public us claus __PUNCT__
justic o'connor foresaw that that __PUNCT__ the beneficiari of kelo ar like to be those citizen with disproportion influenc and power in the polit process __PUNCT__ includ larg corpor and develop firm __PUNCT__
as for the victim __PUNCT__ the govern now ha licens to transfer properti from those with fewer resourc to those with more __PUNCT__
the kelo decis give ani govern entiti the abil to take a person properti and give it to a develop __PUNCT__
it repres on of the most alarm reduct of freedom in our lifetim __PUNCT__
an editori from the telegraph herald in dubuqu put it best __PUNCT__ if creat new tax revenu is consid an applic public us __PUNCT__ homeown __PUNCT__ right becom vastli unstabl __PUNCT__
almost ani develop could creat greater tax revenu than a singl home or two __PUNCT__
your home __PUNCT__ as the sai goe __PUNCT__ is your castl __PUNCT__ it is not suppos to be the site of a new shop mall unless you sai so __PUNCT__
and susett kelo did not sai so __PUNCT__
and by ignor her right to do so __PUNCT__ by reduc her freedom __PUNCT__ the court also reveal an astonish lack of respect for the effici and fair of free market __PUNCT__
de moin regist columnist david yepsen argu __PUNCT__ instead of forc peopl to sell properti to govern at mediocr rate __PUNCT__ develop will have to a pai a high enough price so that the properti owner becom a will seller __PUNCT__
and if thei still don't want to sell __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that their choic __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ within on year after thi disastr decis __PUNCT__ report have surfac that nearli __NUM__ properti nationwid were threaten or taken as a result of thi decis __PUNCT__ repres a dramat upward spike in the number of take __PUNCT__
and it is not just homeown who face thi threat __PUNCT__
it is a threat share by million of small busi owner across the countri __PUNCT__
follow kelo __PUNCT__ the million of peopl who have struggl to grow their small busi mai find themselv forc to sell if the local govern decid that their properti could be put to better us by a bigger busi or larger competitor __PUNCT__
in state after state __PUNCT__ poll make clear that the american public understand the kelo rule is a disast __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of ohioan oppos us emin domain to take properti for econom develop __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of minnesotan __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of kansan __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of coloradan __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ percent of missourian __PUNCT__
the american public ha spoken with on voic __PUNCT__ and thei sai that thi is not right __PUNCT__
i have co __PUNCT__ sponsor legisl to forbid thi kind of govern take __PUNCT__ congress and the state should follow iowa lead and pass such law __PUNCT__
but law defend privat properti ar onli as secur as the judg that defend those law __PUNCT__
kelo pass narrowli __PUNCT__ support by a five to four major with a track record of legisl from the bench __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i pledg to appoint strict constructionist judg who respect the constitut and understand the secur of privat properti it provid __PUNCT__
if need be __PUNCT__ i would seek to amend the constitut to protect privat properti right in america __PUNCT__
those of us privileg to lead thi countri need onli be mind of what ha alwai made us great __PUNCT__ have the courag to stand by our principl __PUNCT__ honor our public trust __PUNCT__ and keep our promis to put the countri interest befor our own __PUNCT__
i alwai kept my promis to my countri __PUNCT__
i keep the on i make now __PUNCT__
and i will keep the on i make as presid __PUNCT__
