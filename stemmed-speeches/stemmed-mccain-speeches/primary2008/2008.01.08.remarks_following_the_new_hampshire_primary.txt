tonight __PUNCT__ we have taken a step __PUNCT__ but onli the first step toward repair the broken polit of the past and restor the trust of the american peopl in their govern __PUNCT__
the peopl of new hampshir have told us again that thei do not send us to washington to serv our self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__ but to serv their __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to fight each other for our own polit ambit __PUNCT__ but to fight togeth our real enemi __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to washington to stroke our ego __PUNCT__ but to help them keep thi beauti __PUNCT__ bounti __PUNCT__ bless countri safe __PUNCT__ prosper and proud __PUNCT__
thei don't send us to washington to take more of their monei __PUNCT__ and wast it on thing that add not an ounc to america strength and prosper __PUNCT__ that don't help a singl famili realiz the dream we all dream for our children __PUNCT__ that don't help a singl displac worker find a new job __PUNCT__ and the secur and digniti it assur them __PUNCT__ that won't keep the promis we make to young worker that the retir thei have begun to invest in __PUNCT__ will be there for them when thei need it __PUNCT__

my friend __PUNCT__ i didn't go to washington to go along __PUNCT__ to get along or to plai it safe to serv my own interest __PUNCT__
i went there to serv my countri __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is just what i intend to do if i am so privileg to be elect your presid __PUNCT__
i seek the nomin of a parti that believ in the strength __PUNCT__ industri __PUNCT__ and good of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we don't believ that govern ha all the answer __PUNCT__ but that it should respect the right __PUNCT__ properti and opportun of the peopl to whom we ar account __PUNCT__
we don't believ in grow the size of govern to make it easier to serv our own ambit __PUNCT__
but what govern is expect to do __PUNCT__ it must do with compet __PUNCT__ resolv and wisdom __PUNCT__
in recent year __PUNCT__ we have lost the trust of the peopl __PUNCT__ who share our principl __PUNCT__ but doubt our own allegi to them __PUNCT__
i seek the nomin of our parti to restor that trust __PUNCT__ to return our parti to the principl that have never fail american __PUNCT__ the parti of fiscal disciplin __PUNCT__ low tax __PUNCT__ endur valu __PUNCT__ a strong and capabl defens __PUNCT__ that encourag the enterpris and ingenu of individu __PUNCT__ busi and famili __PUNCT__ who know best how to advanc america economi __PUNCT__ and secur the dream that have made us the greatest nation in histori __PUNCT__
the work that we face in our time is great __PUNCT__ but our opportun greater still __PUNCT__
in a time of war __PUNCT__ and the terribl sacrific it entail __PUNCT__ the promis of a better futur is not alwai clear __PUNCT__
but i promis you __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ we face no enemi __PUNCT__ no matter how cruel __PUNCT__ and no challeng __PUNCT__ no matter how daunt __PUNCT__ greater than the courag __PUNCT__ patriot and determin of american __PUNCT__
we ar the maker of histori __PUNCT__ not it victim __PUNCT__
and as we confront thi enemi __PUNCT__ the peopl privileg to serv in public offic should not evad our mutual respons to defeat them becaus we ar more concern with person or partisan ambit __PUNCT__
whatev the differ between us __PUNCT__ so much more should unit us __PUNCT__
and noth should unit us more close than the imper of defeat an enemi who despis us __PUNCT__ our valu and modern itself __PUNCT__
we must all pull togeth in thi critic hour and proclaim that the histori of the world will not be determin by thi unpardon foe __PUNCT__ but by the aspir __PUNCT__ ideal __PUNCT__ faith and courag of free peopl __PUNCT__
in thi great __PUNCT__ histor task __PUNCT__ we will never surrend __PUNCT__
thei will __PUNCT__
the result of the other parti primari is uncertain at thi time __PUNCT__ but i want to congratul all the campaign in both parti __PUNCT__
i salut the support of all the candid who work so hard to achiev a success tonight and who believ so passion in the promis of their candid __PUNCT__
and i want to assur them that though i did not have their support __PUNCT__ and though we mai disagre from time to time on how best to advanc america interest and ideal __PUNCT__ thei have my genuin respect __PUNCT__
for thei have work for a caus thei believ is good for the countri we all love __PUNCT__ a caus greater than their self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
i learn long ago that serv onli oneself is a petti and unsatisfi ambit __PUNCT__
but serv a caus greater than self __PUNCT__ interest and you will know a happi far more sublim than the fleet pleasur of fame and fortun __PUNCT__
for me that greater caus ha alwai been my countri __PUNCT__ which i have serv imperfectli for mani year __PUNCT__ but have love without ani reserv everi dai of my life __PUNCT__
and howev thi campaign turn out __PUNCT__ and i am more confid tonight that it will turn out much better than onc expect __PUNCT__ i am grate beyond express for the prospect that i might serv her a littl while longer __PUNCT__
that gratitud impos on me the respons to do noth in thi campaign that would make our countri problem harder to solv or that would caus american to despair that a candid for the highest offic in the land would think so littl of the honor that he would put hi own interest befor their __PUNCT__
i take that respons as my most solemn trust __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ we celebr on victori tonight and leav for michigan tomorrow to win anoth __PUNCT__
but let us rememb that our purpos is not our alon __PUNCT__ our success is not an end in itself __PUNCT__
