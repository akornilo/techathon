we ar bless by freedom __PUNCT__ but the import of protect it in everi realm is a messag that politician desper need to hear todai __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we find ourselv at a time when the u. __PUNCT__ economi is grow more slowli than anyon would like __PUNCT__
as you ar well awar __PUNCT__ condit in michigan ar even tougher __PUNCT__ with the state suffer through on of the most sever recess sinc world war ii __PUNCT__
tough time can breed fear __PUNCT__ and the democrat ar us those fear to push an agenda that is tire __PUNCT__ danger __PUNCT__ and will rob us of econom freedom __PUNCT__
onc again __PUNCT__ thei want the govern to make our choic for us __PUNCT__ not respect our dream __PUNCT__ and trust our decis on how best to seiz our opportun __PUNCT__
unemploy is five percent nationwid __PUNCT__ but over seven percent in michigan __PUNCT__
ten percent of michigan job have disappear thi decad and __NUM__ peopl left the state in the past year __PUNCT__
michigan problem ar root in fail govern polici __PUNCT__
heavi regul __PUNCT__ too much govern spend and tax __PUNCT__ and a high cost of do busi ha hurt it dearli __PUNCT__
michigan rank __NUM__ among state in it corpor tax climat __PUNCT__ __NUM__ in it unemploy insur tax climat and __NUM__ in properti tax __PUNCT__
the worst thing that govern could do in thi environ is rais tax __PUNCT__
and yet that is what happen here __PUNCT__
higher tax discourag small busi and entrepreneur __PUNCT__ inhibit econom freedom and slow long __PUNCT__ term growth __PUNCT__
at a time when it can be hard for famili to weather tough econom time __PUNCT__ the govern should not make it harder __PUNCT__
we should cut tax right now on the middl class by elimin the altern minimum tax __PUNCT__ which no longer tax just the rich __PUNCT__
it tax __NUM__ million middl class famili __PUNCT__ take from them nearli __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__
my middl class tax cut is exactli what the sluggish u. __PUNCT__ economi need __PUNCT__
it would lower margin tax rate __PUNCT__ rais econom growth immedi and over the longer term __PUNCT__ and over the next five year lead to an addit __MONEY__ for everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child in america __PUNCT__
it is what the wall street journal would call __PUNCT__ the right stimulu __PUNCT__
i won't let the democrat roll back the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
i believ we should protect the american famili against tax increas by requir a three __PUNCT__ fifth major in congress to rais tax __PUNCT__
but i will cut middl class tax and keep them low the right wai __PUNCT__ by also cut spend so we don't add to the debt we leav to our children __PUNCT__
even if we succe in keep tax low __PUNCT__ michigan busi __PUNCT__ larg multin compani __PUNCT__ small busi __PUNCT__ and entrepreneur alik __PUNCT__ face a tsunami of rise health care cost __PUNCT__
rise health care cost ar a threat to our global competit __PUNCT__ american famili __PUNCT__ budget __PUNCT__ our govern solvenc __PUNCT__ and the profit of american busi __PUNCT__
we must rein in the grow cost of care if we ar to compet global __PUNCT__
my plan put monei in the hand of famili __PUNCT__ a tax credit of up to __MONEY__ for a famili and open up greater competit and innov so that everyon __PUNCT__ hospit __PUNCT__ insur compani __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ drug compani __PUNCT__ is account to the american famili __PUNCT__
the wall street journal call it __PUNCT__ suppli side medicin __PUNCT__ for american health care __PUNCT__
it will lower cost __PUNCT__ maintain qualiti __PUNCT__ and end the frustrat of american famili __PUNCT__
health care in the unit state suffer from too much regul __PUNCT__
ronald reagan show us __NUM__ year ago the power of deregul to build prosper __PUNCT__
michigan __PUNCT__ and the unit state __PUNCT__ need deregul __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ and privat control of monei __PUNCT__ especi in health care reform __PUNCT__
michigan problem got wors last year when the state govern nearli shut down __PUNCT__ and democrat refus to make the tough choic necessari to focu spend on genuin prioriti __PUNCT__
it yet anoth reason why the american peopl have lost trust in their govern __PUNCT__
i am run for presid to restor the trust of taxpay that the govern will spend their hard earn monei wise __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the govern spend more monei than ever befor __PUNCT__
sinc ronald reagan left offic __PUNCT__ govern spend adjust for inflat ha increas __MONEY__ for everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child in the countri __PUNCT__
wast spend ha gone from irrespons to indefens __PUNCT__
when congress send a pork __PUNCT__ laden spend bill to my desk __PUNCT__ i will veto it __PUNCT__
congress just pass anoth huge __PUNCT__ pork __PUNCT__ fill spend bill __PUNCT__
the democrat allow less than a dai to read all __NUM__ page and stuf it with nearli __NUM__ earmark cost about __MONEY__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
i would veto that bill __PUNCT__
we need to send washington a messag __PUNCT__ no earmark __PUNCT__
not __NUM__ __PUNCT__
not __NUM__ __PUNCT__
zero __PUNCT__
i will enforc fiscal disciplin and return the republican parti to it principl that govern should do it job __PUNCT__ not your job __PUNCT__ and should do it with less of your monei __PUNCT__
when the govern hous is not in order __PUNCT__ it contribut needless uncertainti to the economi __PUNCT__ rais interest rate __PUNCT__ and ultim harm consum and famili __PUNCT__
when interest rate ar low __PUNCT__ individu can afford home loan __PUNCT__ bui new car __PUNCT__ pai off their credit card debt more easili __PUNCT__ and more job ar creat __PUNCT__
tough time breed fear __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ and we ar hear the fear __PUNCT__ monger sai that michigan cannot compet on global market __PUNCT__
those voic ignor the lesson of histori that ani nation that turn to protection hurt itself in the end __PUNCT__
we need to continu to lower barrier to trade becaus nineti __PUNCT__ five percent of the world custom live outsid the unit state __PUNCT__
we need to have competit manufactur through lower health care cost __PUNCT__ lower tax __PUNCT__ and open new market __PUNCT__
our futur prosper depend on our competit __PUNCT__
i will make sure that michigan can compet __PUNCT__
alreadi it export __MONEY__ billion to canada __PUNCT__ a crucial trade partner __PUNCT__
between __NUM__ and __NUM__ michigan even increas it export to china __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ china __PUNCT__ by over __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
but we can do better __PUNCT__
i will insist that china trade fairli and that the wto agreement ar enforc so that their import ar safe __PUNCT__
it would be a mistak to view econom relat with china in isol __PUNCT__
i am concern that china through it piraci of us intellectu properti is also build itself into a militari superpow that ha alreadi develop the capabl to shoot down satellit __PUNCT__
we will onli be success in get china to meet it intern econom oblig by engag it on the full rang of issu involv in our relat __PUNCT__ from suppress of person and religi freedom __PUNCT__ to relat with north korea and iran __PUNCT__ to it rise influenc in africa __PUNCT__ which will determin whether china will emerg as a respons or irrespons world power __PUNCT__
i have the experi in these area that will also serv to ensur that american worker __PUNCT__ the most product worker in the world __PUNCT__ will be even more competit __PUNCT__
global is here to stai __PUNCT__
that is not someth to fear __PUNCT__
it is an opportun to be seiz __PUNCT__
but global will not automat benefit everi american __PUNCT__
chang is hard __PUNCT__ and while most of us gain __PUNCT__ some industri __PUNCT__ compani and worker ar forc to struggl with veri difficult choic __PUNCT__
it wasn't govern job to spend million to save buggi whip factori and haberdash when car replac carriag and men stop wear hat __PUNCT__
but it is govern job to help worker get the educ and train thei need for the new job that will be creat by new busi in thi new centuri __PUNCT__
right now we have a dozen differ program for displac worker and other out of a job __PUNCT__
our unemploy insur program wa design to assist worker through a few tough month dure an econom downturn until their old job came back __PUNCT__
we need program that work in the world we live in todai __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i work with congress and the state to overhaul unemploy insur and make it a program for retrain __PUNCT__ reloc and assist worker who have lost a job that not come back to find a job that won't go awai __PUNCT__
we need to better connect train with busi knowledg and need __PUNCT__
as i talk to busi peopl and educ expert i hear again and again that commun colleg do a great job of provid the right skill to worker and the right worker for firm __PUNCT__
we should take greater advantag of thi record of success __PUNCT__
and we can trust worker to choos __PUNCT__
we need to transform rigid train program to approach that can be us to meet the bill __PUNCT__ pai for train __PUNCT__ and get back to work __PUNCT__
older worker can us their experi and work ethic to adapt to the challeng of the next job __PUNCT__ but often the start pai of the next job doesn't measur up __PUNCT__
we should give these displac worker who move to a new job a few year of supplement to their earn so that the impact of their econom disloc is not so sever __PUNCT__
thei will be less resist to take a lower pai job and we will all benefit from have their experi back on the job __PUNCT__
i have alwai believ that befor i can win someon vote __PUNCT__ i have to win their respect __PUNCT__
and to do that i have to be honest with you __PUNCT__
so here a littl straight talk i know the peopl of michigan will understand __PUNCT__
some job that have left michigan ar not come back __PUNCT__
and the answer to that isn't to rais fals hope that somehow we can bring back lost job but to creat new on __PUNCT__
our countri danger depend on foreign oil threaten both our nation secur and our environ __PUNCT__ not to mention the terribl injuri effect high oil price ha on our economi __PUNCT__
the transfer of hundr of billion of dollar of american wealth to the middl east help sustain the condit on which terrorist prei __PUNCT__
some of the most oil __PUNCT__ rich nation ar the most stagnant societi on earth __PUNCT__
as long as petro __PUNCT__ dollar flow freeli to them those regim have littl incent to open their polit and economi so that all their peopl mai benefit from their countri __PUNCT__ natur wealth __PUNCT__
the middl east exampl is spread to our own hemispher __PUNCT__
venezuela hugo chavez is us hi countri oil revenu to establish a dictatorship __PUNCT__ bulli hi neighbor and succe castro as latin america lead antagonist of the unit state __PUNCT__
in russia __PUNCT__ vladimir putin is us oil as a geopolit weapon and the sale proce to fund a rollback of democ raci __PUNCT__
at the same time that we make america safer __PUNCT__ we can meet our oblig to futur gener __PUNCT__
i believ that we must address climat chang now just as republican teddi roosevelt had the vision a centuri ago to preserv mani of the natur treasur our famili enjoi todai __PUNCT__
america remain the world innov __PUNCT__ we can and should be at the forefront of green technolog __PUNCT__
our futur prosper depend on our competit __PUNCT__ and thi is an opportun for american ingenu and entrepreneuri to keep us on the cut edg __PUNCT__
we can't do that without michigan __PUNCT__ and the automobil industri that ha been the engin of your prosper __PUNCT__
hasten the develop of renew energi sourc __PUNCT__ includ nuclear power __PUNCT__ is obvious a critic import part of the solut __PUNCT__
but no more so than manufactur car that run on someth other than gasolin __PUNCT__
the automobil industri is alreadi make real progress toward thi end __PUNCT__ but we must acceler effort to achiev the necessari technolog breakthrough that will reduc our consumpt of gasolin __PUNCT__ hybrid car and hydrogen engin and long last batteri and other promis advanc __PUNCT__
michigan ha a bright futur __PUNCT__ but it will not be reach by attempt to recr eat the past __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ america best dai ar still to come __PUNCT__
you can't sell me on hopeless __PUNCT__
you can't convinc me that our problem ar insurmount __PUNCT__
american have never met a challeng we couldn't overcom with hard work __PUNCT__ ingenu and dare __PUNCT__
we can break our danger depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ make our countri and the world safer __PUNCT__ our environ cleaner and creat new job for the experienc __PUNCT__ capabl and product worker of michigan __PUNCT__
let it begin now __PUNCT__
let it begin in michigan __PUNCT__
we stand on the threshold of anoth centuri of american leadership __PUNCT__
we have the opportun to write anoth chapter of american great __PUNCT__
those of us privileg to lead thi countri need onli be mind of what ha alwai made us great __PUNCT__ have the courag to stand by our principl __PUNCT__ honor our public trust __PUNCT__ and keep our promis to put the countri interest befor our own __PUNCT__
