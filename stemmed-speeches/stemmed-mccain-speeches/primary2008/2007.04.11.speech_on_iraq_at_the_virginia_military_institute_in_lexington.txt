i just return from my fifth visit to iraq __PUNCT__
unlik the veteran here todai __PUNCT__ i risk noth more threaten than a hostil press corp __PUNCT__
and my onli mission wa to inform my opinion with fact __PUNCT__
we still face mani difficult challeng in iraq __PUNCT__
that is undeni __PUNCT__
but we have also made __PUNCT__ in recent week __PUNCT__ measur progress in establish secur in baghdad and fight al qaeda in anbar provinc __PUNCT__
to deni the difficulti and uncertainti ahead is an egregi disservic to the public __PUNCT__
but as gener petraeu implement hi plan to correct the flaw strategi we follow in the past __PUNCT__ and attempt to spare the unit state and the world the catastroph of an american defeat __PUNCT__ it is an equal disservic to dismiss earli sign of progress __PUNCT__
and now we confront a choic as histor import as ani we have face in a long while __PUNCT__
will thi nation elect leader make the polit hard but strateg vital decis to give gener petraeu our full support and do what is necessari to succe in iraq __PUNCT__ or will we decid to take advantag of the public frustrat __PUNCT__ accept defeat __PUNCT__ and hope that whatev the cost to our secur the polit of defeat will work out better for us than our oppon __PUNCT__ for my part __PUNCT__ i would rather lose a campaign than a war __PUNCT__
howev it end __PUNCT__ the war in iraq will have a profound influenc on the futur of the middl east __PUNCT__ global stabil __PUNCT__ and the secur of the unit state __PUNCT__ which will remain __PUNCT__ for the forese futur __PUNCT__ directli affect by event in that danger part of the world __PUNCT__
the war is part of a broader struggl in the arab and muslim world __PUNCT__ the struggl between violent extremist and the forc of modern and moder __PUNCT__
in the earli dai after 9/11 __PUNCT__ our countri wa unit in a singl purpos __PUNCT__ to find the terrorist bent on our destruct and elimin the threat thei pose to us __PUNCT__
in the interven year __PUNCT__ we have learn the complex of the struggl against radic islam ideolog __PUNCT__
the extremist __PUNCT__ a tini percentag of the hundr of million of peac muslim __PUNCT__ ar flexibl __PUNCT__ intellig __PUNCT__ determin and unconstrain by intern border __PUNCT__
thei wish to return the world to the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and thei will us ani mean __PUNCT__ no matter how inhuman __PUNCT__ to elimin anyon who stand in the wai __PUNCT__
but the vast major of muslim ar try to modern their societi to meet the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
while al qaeda seek to destroi __PUNCT__ million of muslim attempt to build the same element of a good life that all of us want __PUNCT__ secur __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ and hope __PUNCT__
the war on terror __PUNCT__ the war for the futur of the middl east __PUNCT__ and the struggl for the soul of islam __PUNCT__ of which the war in iraq constitut a kei element __PUNCT__ ar bound togeth __PUNCT__
progress in on requir progress in all __PUNCT__
the mani complex challeng we face requir more than a militari respons __PUNCT__
thi is a contest of idea and valu as much as it is on of bullet and bomb __PUNCT__
we must gain the activ support of modern across the muslim world __PUNCT__ who want to share in the benefit of the global system and it econom success __PUNCT__ and who aspir to the polit freedom that is __PUNCT__ i truli believ __PUNCT__ the natur desir of the human heart __PUNCT__
no matter how much attent their ruthless tactic receiv __PUNCT__ terrorist ar not the true face of islam __PUNCT__
devout muslim in lebanon __PUNCT__ indonesia __PUNCT__ pakistan and egypt __PUNCT__ morocco __PUNCT__ bahrain __PUNCT__ and in iraq __PUNCT__ aspir to progress for their societi in which basic human need ar met for more than the privileg few and basic human right ar respect __PUNCT__
the unit state need stronger allianc __PUNCT__ coalit __PUNCT__ and partnership worldwid to engag thi long and multidimension struggl __PUNCT__
we need to pai care attent to america imag and moral credibl __PUNCT__
and in thi broad effort __PUNCT__ the outcom of the war in iraq will plai a pivot role __PUNCT__
on my trip __PUNCT__ i travel to baghdad __PUNCT__ ramadi __PUNCT__ and tikrit __PUNCT__ met with iraqi cabinet offic __PUNCT__ our top militari leadership __PUNCT__ includ gener petraeu and odierno __PUNCT__ and with embassi offici __PUNCT__ includ our new ambassador __PUNCT__ ryan crocker __PUNCT__
i also had the privileg of spend time with our soldier __PUNCT__ from gener to privat __PUNCT__
their courag and resolv in thi frustrat war is an inspir __PUNCT__ and serv as a remind of our oblig to avoid the expedi of easi __PUNCT__ but empti answer or the allur of polit advantag to choos the path in iraq that best honor their sacrific __PUNCT__
we go to need their courag more than ever __PUNCT__
the divis in iraqi societi ar deep __PUNCT__ and the need for greater secur critic __PUNCT__
innoc iraqi ar still be murder __PUNCT__ and our soldier ar brave danger no less threaten than in the past __PUNCT__
everi dai we read about or watch on televis the latest car bomb __PUNCT__ i explos or sniper attack __PUNCT__
but someth els is happen __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
there ar the first glimmer of progress under gener petraeu __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ militari strategi __PUNCT__
while these glimmer ar no guarante of success __PUNCT__ and though thei come earli in the implement of the new strategi __PUNCT__ i believ thei ar caus for veri cautiou optim __PUNCT__
for the first time in my visit to iraq __PUNCT__ our deleg wa abl to drive __PUNCT__ not fly by helicopt __PUNCT__ from the airport to downtown baghdad __PUNCT__
for the first time we met with a sunni tribal leader in anbar provinc __PUNCT__ who is work with american and iraqi forc to fight al qaeda __PUNCT__
sixteen of the twenti __PUNCT__ four sunni tribal leader in anbar ar now work with us __PUNCT__
we visit iraqi and american forc deploi togeth in baghdad __PUNCT__ an integr part of the new secur plan __PUNCT__ where thei maintain a presenc in a neighborhood clear of militia and terrorist __PUNCT__ and hold the ground thei have retaken rather than return to base __PUNCT__ after which the enemi return to impos it will again on a defenseless popul __PUNCT__
the govern of prime minist maliki is deliv on it promis to deploi iraqi brigad to baghdad __PUNCT__
a plan to share oil revenu equit among all iraqi ha been approv by iraqi minist and is pend approv by the parliament __PUNCT__
after an import visit by prime minist maliki to ramadi in sunni domin anbar __PUNCT__ he promis a new polici to allai sunni fear that thei will be exclud from share in the polit futur of the countri __PUNCT__
an import result of the new secur plan is the cooper we ar receiv from the iraqi peopl __PUNCT__ who ar begin to provid us with action intellig about the whereabout and plan of the enemi __PUNCT__
these welcom develop have occur even though onli three of our five addit brigad have arriv __PUNCT__
these and other indic of progress ar encourag __PUNCT__ but thei ar not determin __PUNCT__
i understand the damag fals optim doe to public patienc and support __PUNCT__
i learn long ago to be skeptic of offici report that ar long on wish think and short on substanc __PUNCT__
as we make progress in some area __PUNCT__ the enemi strike where we do not have as great a presenc __PUNCT__
but secur in the capit is indispens to a greater level of secur throughout the countri so that polit and econom progress can occur __PUNCT__
and in baghdad __PUNCT__ we ar make progress __PUNCT__
we have a long wai to go __PUNCT__ but for the first time in four year __PUNCT__ we have a strategi that deal with how thing realli ar in iraq and not how we wish them to be __PUNCT__
after my first visit to iraq in __NUM__ i argu for more troop __PUNCT__
i took issu with statement character the insurg as a few __PUNCT__ dead __PUNCT__ ender __PUNCT__ or be in it __PUNCT__ last throe __PUNCT__
i critic the search and destroi strategi and argu for a counter __PUNCT__ insurg approach that separ the reconcil popul from the irreconcil __PUNCT__
that is the cours now follow by gener petraeu __PUNCT__ and the brave american and coalit troop he ha the honor to command __PUNCT__
it is the right strategi __PUNCT__
gener petraeu liter wrote the book on counter insurg __PUNCT__
he is a determin __PUNCT__ resourc and bold command __PUNCT__
our troop __PUNCT__ mani of whom have serv multipl tour in iraq __PUNCT__ ar perform with great skill and braveri __PUNCT__
but the hour is late and __PUNCT__ despit the develop i just describ __PUNCT__ we should have no illus that success is certain __PUNCT__
but have been a critic of the wai thi war wa fought and a propon of the veri strategi now be follow __PUNCT__ it is my oblig to encourag american to give it a chanc to succe __PUNCT__
to do otherwis would be contrari to the interest of my countri and dishonor __PUNCT__
mani in washington have call for an end to our involv in iraq __PUNCT__
yet thei offer no opinion about the consequ of thi cours of action beyond a vagu assur that all will be well if the iraqi ar left to work out their differ themselv __PUNCT__
it is obvious true that no militari solut is capabl of do what the iraqi won't do polit __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ no polit solut ha a chanc to succe when al qaeda is free to foment civil war and iraqi remain depend on sectarian militia to protect their children from be murder __PUNCT__
america ha a vital interest in prevent the emerg of iraq as a wild west for terrorist __PUNCT__ similar to afghanistan befor 9/11 __PUNCT__
by leav iraq befor there is a stabl iraqi govern author we risk precis thi __PUNCT__ and the potenti consequ of allow terrorist sanctuari in iraq is anoth 9/11 or wors __PUNCT__
in iraq todai __PUNCT__ terrorist have resort to level of barbar that shock the world __PUNCT__ and we should not be so na?v as to believ their intent ar limit sole to the border of that countri __PUNCT__
we american ar their primari enemi __PUNCT__ and we american ar their ultim target __PUNCT__
a power vacuum in iraq would invit further interfer from iran at a time when tehran alreadi feel embolden enough to develop nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ threaten israel and america __PUNCT__ and kidnap british sailor __PUNCT__
if the govern collaps in iraq __PUNCT__ which it sure will if we leav prematur __PUNCT__ iraq neighbor __PUNCT__ from saudi arabia __PUNCT__ jordan __PUNCT__ syria __PUNCT__ turkei and egypt __PUNCT__ will feel pressur to interven on the side of their favor faction __PUNCT__
thi uncertain swirl of event could caus the region to explod and foreclos the opportun for million of muslim and their children to achiev freedom __PUNCT__
we could face a terribl choic __PUNCT__ watch the region burn __PUNCT__ the price of oil escal dramat and our economi declin __PUNCT__ watch the terrorist establish new base camp or send american troop back to iraq __PUNCT__ with the odd against our success much wors than thei ar todai __PUNCT__
to enumer the strateg interest at stake in iraq doe not address our moral oblig to a peopl we liber from saddam hussein tyranni __PUNCT__
i suspect mani in thi audienc __PUNCT__ and most member of congress __PUNCT__ look back at america failur to act to prevent genocid in rwanda with shame __PUNCT__
i know i do __PUNCT__
and yet i fear the potenti for genocid and ethnic cleans in iraq is even wors __PUNCT__
the sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ the social divis __PUNCT__ the armament __PUNCT__ the weaken secur apparatu of the state __PUNCT__ all the ingredi ar there __PUNCT__
unless we fight to prevent it __PUNCT__ our withdraw will be coupl with a genocid in which we ar complicit __PUNCT__
given our secur interest and our moral invest in iraq __PUNCT__ so long as we have a chanc to prevail we must try to prevail __PUNCT__
as gener petraeu ha repeatedli state __PUNCT__ it will be sever month or more befor we know with ani confid whether we can turn thi war around __PUNCT__
element of the new civil __PUNCT__ militari strategi ar still be draft __PUNCT__ almost half of the addit troop have yet to arriv __PUNCT__ and mani of the new civilian have yet to take up their post __PUNCT__
we ar off to a good start __PUNCT__ but signific result will take time __PUNCT__
what struck me upon my return from baghdad is the enorm gulf between the harsh but hope realiti in iraq __PUNCT__ where polit is for mani a matter of life and death __PUNCT__ and the fanci and self __PUNCT__ interest debat about iraq that substitut for statesmanship in washington __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ american and iraqi soldier risk everyth to hold the countri togeth __PUNCT__ to prevent it from becom a terrorist sanctuari and the region from descend into the danger chao of a widen war __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ where polit calcul seem to trump all other consider __PUNCT__ democrat in congress and their lead candid for presid __PUNCT__ heedless of the terribl consequ of our failur __PUNCT__ unanim confirm our new command __PUNCT__ and then insist he be prevent from take the action he believ necessari to safeguard our countri interest __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ hope is a fragil thing __PUNCT__ but all the more admir for the courag and sacrific necessari to nurtur it __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ cynic appear to be the qualiti most prize by those who accept defeat but not the respons for it consequ __PUNCT__
befor i left for iraq __PUNCT__ i watch with regret as the hous of repres vote to deni our troop the support necessari to carri out their new mission __PUNCT__
democrat leader smile and cheer as the last vote were count __PUNCT__
what were thei celebr __PUNCT__ defeat __PUNCT__ surrend __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__ onli our enemi were cheer __PUNCT__
a defeat for the unit state is a caus for mourn not celebr __PUNCT__
and determin how the unit state can avert such a disast should encourag the most sober __PUNCT__ public __PUNCT__ spirit reason among our elect leader not the giddi anticip of the next elect __PUNCT__
democrat who vote to author thi war __PUNCT__ and critic the fail strategi that ha led us to thi peril moment __PUNCT__ have the same respons i do __PUNCT__ to offer support when that failur is recogn and the right strategi is propos and the right command take the field to implement it or __PUNCT__ at the least __PUNCT__ to offer an altern strategi that ha some relationship to realiti __PUNCT__
democrat argu we should redirect american resourc to the __PUNCT__ real __PUNCT__ war on terror __PUNCT__ of which iraq is just a sideshow __PUNCT__
but whether or not al qaeda terrorist were a present danger in iraq befor the war __PUNCT__ there is no disput thei ar there now __PUNCT__ and their leader recogn iraq as the main battleground in the war on terror __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ al qaeda terrorist ar the on prepar the car bomb __PUNCT__ fire the katyusha rocket __PUNCT__ plant the i __PUNCT__
thei maneuv in the midst of iraq sectarian conflict __PUNCT__ spark and fuel the horrend violenc __PUNCT__ destroi effort at polit reconcili __PUNCT__ kill innoc on both side in the hope of creat a conflagr that will caus american to lose heart and leav __PUNCT__ so thei can return to their primari mission __PUNCT__ plan and execut attack on the unit state __PUNCT__ and destabil america alli __PUNCT__
it is imposs to separ sectarian violenc from the war against al qaeda __PUNCT__
al qaeda is follow an explicit strategi to foment civil war in iraq __PUNCT__
the onli wai to reduc and final end sectarian violenc is to provid greater secur to the popul than we have in the past __PUNCT__ as we ar do now in baghdad __PUNCT__ to encourag iraqi to abandon their relianc on local militia __PUNCT__ and to destroi al qaeda and other truli irreconcil enemi of the unit state and the iraqi peopl __PUNCT__
our defeat in iraq would constitut a defeat in the war against terror and extrem and would make the world a much more danger place __PUNCT__
the enemi we face there harbor the same deprav indiffer to human life as those who kill three thousand innoc american on a __DATE__ morn in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
a coupl of dai befor i arriv in baghdad __PUNCT__ a suicid car bomb destroi a larg __PUNCT__ busi marketplac __PUNCT__
it wa a bit unusu __PUNCT__ becaus new u. __PUNCT__ and iraqi secur measur in baghdad have reduc the number of car bomb attack __PUNCT__
but thi time the terrorist had a new tactic __PUNCT__ thei drove their car to a secur checkpoint and were wave through becaus there were two small children in the back seat __PUNCT__
the terrorist then walk awai from the car __PUNCT__ leav the children insid it __PUNCT__ and trigger the explos __PUNCT__
if the terrorist ar will to do thi terribl thing to iraqi children __PUNCT__ what ar thei will to do to our children __PUNCT__ some argu the war in iraq no longer ha anyth to do with us __PUNCT__ that it is a hopelessli complic mess of tribal warfar and sectarian conflict __PUNCT__
the situat is complex __PUNCT__ and veri difficult __PUNCT__
yet from on perspect it is quit simpl __PUNCT__
we ar engag in a basic struggl __PUNCT__ a struggl between human and inhuman __PUNCT__ between builder and destroy __PUNCT__
if fight these peopl and prevent the export of their brand of radic and terror is not intrins to the nation secur and most cherish valu of the unit state __PUNCT__ i don't know what is __PUNCT__
consid our other strateg challeng in the region __PUNCT__ prevent iran from go nuclear __PUNCT__ stabil afghanistan against a resurg taliban __PUNCT__ the battl for the futur of pakistan __PUNCT__ egypt __PUNCT__ saudi arabia and other __PUNCT__ protect israel secur __PUNCT__ the struggl for lebanon independ __PUNCT__
doe ani honest observ believ those challeng will be easier to confront and at lesser cost in american blood and treasur if the unit state accept defeat in iraq __PUNCT__ we all agre a militari solut alon will not solv the problem of iraq __PUNCT__
there must be a polit agreement among iraqi that allow all group to particip in the build of their nation __PUNCT__ to share in it resourc and to live in peac with each other __PUNCT__
but without greater secur impos by the unit state militari and the iraqi armi __PUNCT__ there can be no polit solut __PUNCT__
as american and iraqi sacrific to provid that secur __PUNCT__ iraq leader must do the hard work of polit reconcili __PUNCT__
we can help them get there __PUNCT__ but we cannot assum their respons __PUNCT__
unless thei accept their own oblig to all iraqi __PUNCT__ we will all fail __PUNCT__ and america __PUNCT__ iraq and the world will have to live with the terribl consequ __PUNCT__
we ar give iraq leader and peopl the chanc to have a better futur __PUNCT__ but thei must seiz it __PUNCT__
in the mani mistak we have made in thi war __PUNCT__ a few lesson have becom clear __PUNCT__
america should never undertak a war unless we ar prepar to do everyth necessari to succe __PUNCT__ and unless we have a realist and comprehens plan for success __PUNCT__
we did not meet thi respons initi __PUNCT__
we ar try to do so now __PUNCT__
respons polit leader __PUNCT__ statesmen __PUNCT__ do not add to the burden our troop carri __PUNCT__
that is what democrat __PUNCT__ intention or not __PUNCT__ have done by fail to provid them with the resourc necessari to succe in their mission __PUNCT__
everi dai that pass without the necessari fund appropri to sustain our troop __PUNCT__ our chanc of success in iraq dwindl and our militari readi declin further __PUNCT__
we have sent the best american among us to fight in iraq __PUNCT__ at the least __PUNCT__ we must give them the tool thei need to do their job __PUNCT__
when the presid veto __PUNCT__ as he should __PUNCT__ the bill that refus to support gener petraeu __PUNCT__ new plan __PUNCT__ i hope democrat in congress will heed the advic of on of their lead candid for presid __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ and immedi pass a new bill to provid support to our troop in iraq without substitut their partisan interest for those of our troop and our countri __PUNCT__
i know the pain war caus __PUNCT__
i understand the frustrat caus by our mistak in thi war __PUNCT__
i sympath with the fatigu of the american peopl __PUNCT__
and i regret sincer the addit sacrific impos on the brave american who defend us __PUNCT__
but i also know the toll a lost war take on an armi and a countri __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ who ar will to support thi new strategi __PUNCT__ and give gener petraeu the time and support he need __PUNCT__ have chosen a hard road __PUNCT__
but it is the right road __PUNCT__
it is necessari and just __PUNCT__
democrat __PUNCT__ who deni our soldier the mean to prevent an american defeat __PUNCT__ have chosen anoth road __PUNCT__
it mai appear to be the easier cours of action __PUNCT__ but it is a much more reckless on __PUNCT__ and it doe them no credit even if it give them an advantag in the next elect __PUNCT__
thi is an histor choic __PUNCT__ with ramif for american not even born yet __PUNCT__
let put asid for a moment the small polit of the dai __PUNCT__
the judgment of histori should be the approv we seek __PUNCT__ not the temporari favor of the latest public opinion poll __PUNCT__
we all respect the sacrific made by our soldier __PUNCT__
we all mourn the loss thei have suffer in thi war __PUNCT__
but let us honor them by do all we can to ensur their sacrific were not made in vain __PUNCT__
let us show an appropri humil by recogn that so littl is ask of us compar to the burden we impos on them __PUNCT__ and let us show just a small __PUNCT__ but signific measur of their courag __PUNCT__ resolv and patriot by put our countri interest befor everi person or polit consider __PUNCT__
in close __PUNCT__ i like to bring to your attent the gallantri and patriot of on american who serv with distinct in iraq __PUNCT__ a navi seal __PUNCT__ who refus to quit hi mission and let the countri he love so well suffer the terribl harm our defeat would entail __PUNCT__
