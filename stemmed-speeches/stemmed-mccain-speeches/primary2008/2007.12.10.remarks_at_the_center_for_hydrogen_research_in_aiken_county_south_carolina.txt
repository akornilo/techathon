thank you __PUNCT__
i appreci the chanc to be here at the center for hydrogen research and to talk with you about a great and urgent challeng __PUNCT__ break our nation critic depend on foreign sourc of oil __PUNCT__ and make america safer __PUNCT__ stronger and more prosper by modern the wai we gener and emploi energi __PUNCT__
south carolina ha been a leader in make america more energi secur __PUNCT__ particularli in the area of nuclear power __PUNCT__
for over fifti year the savannah river site wa critic to our nation secur __PUNCT__
in the futur thi site will be an integr part of our move toward energi secur __PUNCT__
oil is often call the lifeblood of our economi __PUNCT__ the indispens commod that keep commerc hum and america on the move __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ in todai world __PUNCT__ our depend on foreign oil and the wai we us hydrocarbon is a major strateg vulner __PUNCT__ a threat to our secur __PUNCT__ our economi and the well be of our planet __PUNCT__
great nation don't leav the __PUNCT__ lifeblood __PUNCT__ of their economi in the hand of foreign cartel or bet their futur on a commod locat in countri where authoritarian repress their peopl and terrorist find their main support __PUNCT__
terrorist understand the serious of our vulner __PUNCT__
al qaeda plan for attack on oil facil in the middl east to destroi the american economi __PUNCT__
a littl over a year ago __PUNCT__ a suicid attack at a major saudi arabian oil refineri came close to disabl it target __PUNCT__
we on success attack awai from an econom crisi __PUNCT__
the flow of oil ha mani chokepoint __PUNCT__ pipelin __PUNCT__ refineri __PUNCT__ transit rout __PUNCT__ and termin __PUNCT__ most of them outsid our jurisdict and control __PUNCT__
our enemi understand the effect on america of a signific disrupt in suppli __PUNCT__ a crippl transport system __PUNCT__ gasolin too expens for mani american to purchas __PUNCT__ busi close __PUNCT__
al qaeda must revel in the ironi that america is effect help to fund both side of the war thei caus __PUNCT__
as we sacrific blood and treasur __PUNCT__ some of our ga dollar flow to the fanat who build the bomb __PUNCT__ hatch the plot __PUNCT__ and carri out attack on our soldier and citizen __PUNCT__
iran made over __MONEY__ billion from oil sale in __NUM__ and it is the number on state sponsor of terror __PUNCT__
the transfer of american wealth to the middl east help sustain the condit on which terrorist prei __PUNCT__
some of the most oil __PUNCT__ rich nation ar the most stagnant societi on earth __PUNCT__
as long as petro __PUNCT__ dollar flow freeli to them those regim have littl incent to open their polit and economi so that all their peopl mai benefit from their countri __PUNCT__ natur wealth __PUNCT__
the middl east exampl is spread to our own hemispher __PUNCT__
venezuela hugo chavez is us hi countri oil revenu to establish a dictatorship __PUNCT__ bulli hi neighbor and succe castro as latin america lead antagonist of the unit state __PUNCT__
in russia __PUNCT__ vladimir putin is us oil as a geopolit weapon and the sale proce to fund a rollback of democraci __PUNCT__
the polit of oil imped the global progress of our valu __PUNCT__ and restrain govern from act on the most basic impuls of human decenc __PUNCT__
there is onli on reason china ha oppos sanction to pressur sudan to stop the kill in darfur __PUNCT__ china need sudan oil __PUNCT__
we should hasten the dai when america can wield it power at the tabl of diplomaci in the middl east with an understand that we ar not depend on their oil __PUNCT__
the burn of oil and other fossil fuel is contribut to the danger accumul of greenhous gase in the earth atmospher __PUNCT__ alter our climat with the potenti for major social __PUNCT__ econom and polit upheav __PUNCT__
it is a seriou and urgent econom __PUNCT__ environment and nation secur challeng __PUNCT__
is it too big a challeng for america to tackl __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it is not __PUNCT__
no peopl have ever been better innov and problem solver than american __PUNCT__
the peopl of south carolina provid an exampl for us to follow in develop energi secur __PUNCT__
it is in our nation dna to see challeng as opportun __PUNCT__ to conquer problem beyond the expect of an admir world __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ reli as alwai on the industri and imagin of a free peopl __PUNCT__ and the power and innov of free market __PUNCT__ is capabl of overcom ani challeng from within and without our border __PUNCT__
our enemi believ we too weak to overcom our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
even some of our alli think we no longer the world most visionari __PUNCT__ most capabl countri or commit to the advanc of mankind __PUNCT__
i think we know better than that __PUNCT__
i think we know who we ar and what we can do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let remind the world __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i propos a nation energi strategi that will amount to a declar of independ from the fear bred by our relianc on oil sheik and our vulner to the troubl polit of the land thei rule __PUNCT__
when we reach the limit of militari power and diplomaci to contain the danger of that cauldron of burn resent and extrem __PUNCT__ energi secur is our best defens __PUNCT__
we won't achiev it tomorrow __PUNCT__ but we must achiev it in our time __PUNCT__
the strategi i propos won't be anoth grab bag of handout to thi or that industri and a full employ act for lobbyist __PUNCT__
it will reli on the geniu and technolog prowess of american industri and scienc __PUNCT__
govern must set achiev goal __PUNCT__ but the market should be free to produc the mean __PUNCT__
those mean ar within our reach __PUNCT__
energi effici by us improv technolog and practic sensibl habit in our home __PUNCT__ busi and automobil is a big part of the answer __PUNCT__ and is someth we can achiev right now __PUNCT__
flexibl __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl aren't futurist pie in the sky __PUNCT__
we can easili deploi such technolog todai for less than __MONEY__ per vehicl __PUNCT__ and we develop the infrastructur necessari to take full advantag __PUNCT__
alcohol fuel made from corn __PUNCT__ sugar __PUNCT__ switch grass and mani other sourc that could benefit that rural farm economi of south carolina and other state __PUNCT__ fuel cell __PUNCT__ biodiesel deriv from wast product __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ and other technolog ar all promis and avail altern to oil __PUNCT__
i won't support subsid everi altern or tariff that restrict the healthi competit that stimul innov and lower cost __PUNCT__
but i encourag the develop of infrastructur and market growth necessari for these product to compet __PUNCT__ and let consum choos the winner __PUNCT__
i never known an american entrepreneur worthi of the name who wouldn't rather compet for sale than subsidi __PUNCT__
america electr product is for the most part petroleum free __PUNCT__ and the exist electr power grid ha the capac to handl the ad demand impos by plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid vehicl __PUNCT__
we can add more capac and improv it reliabl in the year ahead __PUNCT__
i work to promot real partnership between util and automak to acceler the deploy of plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__
we have in us todai a zero emiss energi that could provid electr for million more home and busi than it current doe __PUNCT__
yet it ha been over twenti __PUNCT__ five year sinc a nuclear power plant ha been construct __PUNCT__
the barrier to nuclear energi ar polit not technolog __PUNCT__
we let the fear of thirti year ago __PUNCT__ and an endless polit squabbl over the storag of nuclear spent fuel make it virtual imposs to build a singl new plant that produc a form of energi that is safe and non __PUNCT__ pollut __PUNCT__
the savannah river site ha been instrument in the develop of new reactor technolog that is more fuel effici and safe __PUNCT__
if franc can produc __NUM__ percent of it electr with nuclear power __PUNCT__ why can't we __PUNCT__ is franc a more secur __PUNCT__ advanc and innov countri than we ar __PUNCT__ ar franc scientist and entrepreneur more capabl than we ar __PUNCT__ i need no answer to that rhetor question __PUNCT__
i know my countri well enough to know otherwis __PUNCT__
let provid for safe storag of spent nuclear fuel __PUNCT__ and give host state or local a proprietari interest so when advanc recycl technolog turn us fuel into a valuabl commod __PUNCT__ the public will share in it econom benefit __PUNCT__
the savannah river site would be an ideal locat to demonstr that recycl spent nuclear fuel is possibl in the unit state __PUNCT__
other countri __PUNCT__ such as franc and japan __PUNCT__ alreadi recycl spent fuel __PUNCT__
we should do the same __PUNCT__
and south carolina mox program remind us that the expans of the us of nuclear power will enabl us to turn our sword into plowshar and make the world safer through the convers of weapon grade materi that can be us by terrorist or rogu nation into fuel for commerci nuclear reactor for peac us __PUNCT__
there is much we can do to increas our own oil product in wai that protect the environ us advanc technolog __PUNCT__ includ those that us and buri carbon dioxid __PUNCT__ to recov the oil below the well we have alreadi drill __PUNCT__ and tap oil __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ and shale econom with minim environment impact __PUNCT__
the unit state ha coal reserv more abund than saudi arabia oil reserv __PUNCT__
we found a wai to cut down acid rain pollut from burn coal __PUNCT__ and we can find a wai to us our coal resourc without emit excess greenhous gase __PUNCT__
we can also find wai to us new sourc of power like hydrogen __PUNCT__
my energi polici will reli on set good incent for firm __PUNCT__ entrepreneur __PUNCT__ and household __PUNCT__
but thei will not shortchang the need for basic research to provid the pathwai for new sourc of energi __PUNCT__ better materi __PUNCT__ improv batteri __PUNCT__ and other advanc in knowledg that will be central to rise to thi great challeng __PUNCT__
the research be perform at clemson univers and the intern center for automot research is unlock the possibl for hydrogen fuel automobil __PUNCT__
and research at the univers of south carolina and the savannah river nation laboratori is advanc the potenti for other hydrogen technolog __PUNCT__
america compet in a global economi where innov and entrepreneurship ar the pillar of prosper __PUNCT__
the competit is stiff and the stake ar high __PUNCT__
we have the opportun to appli america technolog supremaci to captur the export market for advanc energi technolog __PUNCT__ reap the capit invest and good job it will provid __PUNCT__
our innov __PUNCT__ scientist __PUNCT__ entrepreneur and worker have the knowledg __PUNCT__ resourc __PUNCT__ and drive to lead the wai on energi secur __PUNCT__ as we have in so mani other world __PUNCT__ chang advanc __PUNCT__
the race ha alwai been to the swift __PUNCT__ and america must be first to market with innov that meet mankind grow energi and environment need __PUNCT__
i have propos a bipartisan plan to address the problem of climat chang and stimul the develop and us of advanc technolog __PUNCT__
it is a market __PUNCT__ base approach that would set reason cap on carbon and other greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ and provid industri with tradabl credit __PUNCT__
by reduc it emiss __PUNCT__ a util or industri plant can gener credit it mai trade on the open market for a profit __PUNCT__ offer a power incent to drive the deploy of new and better energi sourc and technolog __PUNCT__ for automak to develop new wai to lower pollut and increas mileag __PUNCT__ for util to gener cleaner electr and captur carbon __PUNCT__ for applianc manufactur to make more effici product __PUNCT__ and for the nation to us energi with maximum effici __PUNCT__ build conserv into the economi in a manner that produc financi and environment benefit __PUNCT__
as it alwai doe __PUNCT__ the profit motiv will attract the transform power of ventur capit __PUNCT__ and unleash the market to move clean altern fuel and advanc energi technolog from the margin into the mainstream __PUNCT__
some urg we do noth becaus we can't be certain how bad the problem might becom or thei presum the worst effect ar most like to occur in our grandchildren lifetim __PUNCT__
i a proud conserv __PUNCT__ and i reject that kind of live __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ me gener __PUNCT__ attitud __PUNCT__
it is unworthi of us __PUNCT__
american have never fear chang __PUNCT__
we make chang work for us __PUNCT__
climat chang is a global problem that requir a global solut __PUNCT__
america ha both an oblig and a compel nation interest in fulfil our histor leadership role __PUNCT__
china carbon emiss will soon exce our __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will invit a collabor relationship with china to make coal us cleaner and climat friendli __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ we should address the problem on our term __PUNCT__ and bring other into the fold of a common sens effort to solv it __PUNCT__ while we sell to the world the technolog need to do it __PUNCT__
answer great challeng is noth new to america __PUNCT__
it what we do __PUNCT__
we built the rocket that took us to the moon not becaus it wa easi but becaus it wa hard __PUNCT__
we sent space probe into the distant reach of the univers __PUNCT__
we har nuclear energi __PUNCT__ map the human genom __PUNCT__ creat the internet and pioneer integr circuit that possess the comput power of apollo spacecraft on a singl silicon chip you can bare see __PUNCT__
we can solv our oil depend and becom more energi secur __PUNCT__
we can leav a cleaner planet for the next gener __PUNCT__
you can't sell me on hopeless __PUNCT__
you can't convinc me the problem is insurmount __PUNCT__
i know my countri __PUNCT__
i know what we capabl of __PUNCT__
we capabl of unimagin progress __PUNCT__ unmatch prosper __PUNCT__ and vision that see around the corner of histori __PUNCT__
we alwai understood our time __PUNCT__ accept our challeng and made from our opportun __PUNCT__ anoth better world __PUNCT__
my peopl ar american __PUNCT__
our time is todai __PUNCT__
that is the countri i ask to lead __PUNCT__
