mr __PUNCT__ chairman __PUNCT__ thank you for hold thi hear todai __PUNCT__ and thank you for give me the opportun to speak in support of s __PUNCT__ __NUM__ the feder fund account and transpar act __PUNCT__
i am pleas to be an origin cosponsor of thi bill and i am confid it passag would go a long wai in help to reign in feder spend __PUNCT__
thi bill would direct the offic of manag and budget __PUNCT__ omb __PUNCT__ to creat a searchabl databas __PUNCT__ avail to the public at no cost __PUNCT__ that list each entiti receiv feder fund __PUNCT__
the websit would show the amount of feder fund the entiti receiv in each of the last __NUM__ fiscal year __PUNCT__ an item breakdown of each transact __PUNCT__ the locat of the entiti __PUNCT__ and a __PUNCT__ uniqu identifi __PUNCT__ for the entiti and it parent entiti __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ chairman __PUNCT__ thi bill ha receiv support from both side of the aisl and from a bipartisan coalit of over __NUM__ organ __PUNCT__
in my view __PUNCT__ the reason for such broad support is simpl __PUNCT__ peopl ar begin to realiz that the onli wai to control spend and ensur account is to let the american peopl see exactli how their monei is be spent __PUNCT__
critic of thi bill have suggest that the requir of the legisl ar too burdensom and that it would be too costli and take too much work to collect and post thi data __PUNCT__
i don't bui that argument __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ chairman __PUNCT__
omb alreadi maintain the data necessari for thi websit __PUNCT__ and the technolog clearli exist to implement the requir of thi bill __PUNCT__
more importantli __PUNCT__ the cost of the wast __PUNCT__ fraud __PUNCT__ and abus that can remain hidden in the system without such a disclosur is much more costli to the american taxpay than the implement of thi bill __PUNCT__
our nation futur econom success rest in part on the decis we make todai __PUNCT__ and the on we put off __PUNCT__
we ar face some dire fiscal challeng in the dai ahead __PUNCT__
accord to the govern account offic __PUNCT__ gao __PUNCT__ the unfund feder financi burden __PUNCT__ such as public debt __PUNCT__ futur social secur __PUNCT__ medicar __PUNCT__ and medicaid payment __PUNCT__ total more than __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ or __MONEY__ per man __PUNCT__ woman and child __PUNCT__
accord to david walker __PUNCT__ the head of the gao __PUNCT__ for a famili __PUNCT__ thi burden is __PUNCT__ like have a __MONEY__ mortgag __PUNCT__ and no hous __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ instead of fix the problem __PUNCT__ and fix it will not be easi __PUNCT__ we onli succeed in make it bigger __PUNCT__ more unstabl __PUNCT__ more complic __PUNCT__ and much __PUNCT__ much more expens __PUNCT__
time and time again __PUNCT__ attempt have been made to slow the growth of feder spend and time and time again those effort have fail __PUNCT__
we need a new approach __PUNCT__
i long believ that real budgetari reform won't happen until the american peopl demand greater account for how their tax dollar ar be spent __PUNCT__
thi bill could be just the tool necessari to put us on the track to real account and reform __PUNCT__
when american worker look at their pai __PUNCT__ stub each month and see what ha been sent to washington __PUNCT__ thei ought to be abl to learn exactli how that monei is be spent __PUNCT__
when thei see that we ar spend million on bridg to nowher __PUNCT__ teapot museum __PUNCT__ and zoo __PUNCT__ thei demand account from their elect offici __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ chairman __PUNCT__ i sure of it __PUNCT__
a recent editori on __URL__ state that __PUNCT__ congress need to open up and shed light on it busi in mani wai __PUNCT__
with an access databas of grant and contract __PUNCT__ the public mai see spend it despis __PUNCT__ and it mai see spend that it approv of __PUNCT__ down to the last penni __PUNCT__
the onli reason to oppos compil the inform for public us is if the govern ha someth to hide __PUNCT__
i am hope that a searchabl databas of feder spend will help reduc the ever __PUNCT__ increas number of earmark in the annual appropri bill __PUNCT__
the growth in earmark fund dure the past __NUM__ year ha been stagger __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ there were __NUM__ earmark __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ there were __NUM__ __PUNCT__ an increas of nearli __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the largest number of earmark have occur in the last three year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let consid the level of fund associ with those earmark __PUNCT__
the amount of earmark fund increas from __MONEY__ billion in __NUM__ to __MONEY__ billion in fy __NUM__ __PUNCT__
remark __PUNCT__ it rose by __NUM__ percent from __NUM__ to __NUM__ even though the actual number of earmark decreas slightli __PUNCT__
earmark dollar have doubl just sinc __NUM__ and more than tripl in the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
thi is wrong and disgrac and we urgent need to make some seriou __PUNCT__ meaning chang __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ chairman __PUNCT__ we simpli must start make some veri tough decis around here if we ar seriou about improv our fiscal futur __PUNCT__
we need to be think about the futur of america and the futur gener who ar go to be pai the tab for our continu spend __PUNCT__
it is simpli not fiscal respons for us to continu with wast and unnecessari spend __PUNCT__ while pass along good deal to the special interest and their lobbyist __PUNCT__
we have had ampl opportun to tighten our belt in thi town in recent year __PUNCT__ and we have taken a pass each and everi time __PUNCT__
we can't put off the inevit ani longer __PUNCT__
the american peopl have the right to know how and where their tax dollar ar be spent __PUNCT__
thank you again for hold thi hear todai and for allow me the opportun to share my view __PUNCT__
