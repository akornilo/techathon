thank you __PUNCT__ ted __PUNCT__ for that kind introduct __PUNCT__
i want to thank you and everyon here at the federalist societi for your commit to the subject of thi year confer __PUNCT__ limit govern __PUNCT__ and to the rule of law __PUNCT__
i thought i would begin by share with you a few thought about last week elect from a republican point of view __PUNCT__
the voter obvious want to get our attent last week __PUNCT__
while i would have prefer a gentler reproach than the on thei deliv __PUNCT__ i not discourag nor should ani of us be __PUNCT__
democrat had a good elect night __PUNCT__
we did not __PUNCT__
but no defeat is perman __PUNCT__
and parti __PUNCT__ just like individu __PUNCT__ show their charact in advers __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ is the occas to show our __PUNCT__
the elect wa not an affirm of the other parti program __PUNCT__
try as hard as i could __PUNCT__ i couldn't find much evid that my democrat friend were offer anyth that resembl a coher platform or principl leadership on the critic issu that confront us todai __PUNCT__
nor do i believ american reject our valu and govern philosophi __PUNCT__
on the contrari __PUNCT__ i think thei reject us becaus thei felt we had come to valu our incumb over our principl __PUNCT__ and partisanship __PUNCT__ from both parti __PUNCT__ wa no longer a contest of idea __PUNCT__ but an ever cruder and uncivil brawl over the spoil of power __PUNCT__
i am convinc that a major of american still consid themselv conserv or right of center __PUNCT__
thei still prefer common sens conservat to the altern __PUNCT__
american had elect us to chang govern __PUNCT__ and thei reject us becaus thei believ govern had chang us __PUNCT__
we must spend the next two year reacquaint the public and ourselv with the reason we came to offic in the first place __PUNCT__ to serv a caus greater than our self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
common sens conserv believ that the govern that govern least govern best __PUNCT__ that govern should do onli those thing individu cannot do for themselv __PUNCT__ and do them effici __PUNCT__
much ride on that principl __PUNCT__ the integr of the govern __PUNCT__ our prosper __PUNCT__ and everi american self __PUNCT__ respect __PUNCT__ which depend __PUNCT__ as it alwai ha __PUNCT__ on on own decis and action __PUNCT__ and cannot be provid as anoth govern benefit __PUNCT__
hypocrisi __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is the most obviou of polit sin __PUNCT__
and the peopl will punish it __PUNCT__
we were elect to reduc the size of govern and enlarg the sphere of free and privat initi __PUNCT__
we increas the size of govern in the fals hope that we could bribe the public into keep us in offic __PUNCT__
and the peopl punish us __PUNCT__
we lost our principl and our major __PUNCT__
and there is no wai to recov our major without recov our principl first __PUNCT__
while time mai chang __PUNCT__ the valu and principl for which we stand do not __PUNCT__
your work and the mission of the federalist societi is critic to ensur that our nation remain faith to the self __PUNCT__ evid truth and endur principl that have alwai made the american experi an inspir and exampl to the world __PUNCT__
idea like __PUNCT__ limit govern __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ the rule of law __PUNCT__ can sound pretti abstract when we talk about them here in washington in the hall of congress __PUNCT__
and it a measur of how divid our polit have becom that thei ar often taken for partisan __PUNCT__ buzz word __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ thei ar idea worth fight for __PUNCT__ worth dy for __PUNCT__
and american have fought and di for limit govern and the rule of law for well over two hundr year __PUNCT__ in place as close to home as brandywin creek and as far awai as iwo jima __PUNCT__ at gettysburg and khe sanh __PUNCT__ at kandahar and at shanksvil __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__
so it import that we remind ourselv that limit govern and the rule of law ar more than the arid clich of partisan polit debat __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ thei ar the essenti underpin of our freedom __PUNCT__ and the principl for which the federalist societi ha been fight sinc it format over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
to lose either would be to lose freedom __PUNCT__ for thei ar our strongest bulwark against tyranni __PUNCT__
peopl ar suffer todai physic and emot agoni __PUNCT__ terribl loneli __PUNCT__ and even death to advanc those ideal in countri where the power of the state observ no limit __PUNCT__ where human digniti is deni the respect and the protect that must form the basi of moral __PUNCT__ in ani cultur __PUNCT__ ani religion __PUNCT__ and ani societi __PUNCT__
we should never forget their sacrific and purpos __PUNCT__
in the name of those brave peopl __PUNCT__ i want to share with you todai my understand of and support for these vital ideal __PUNCT__
the geniu of our found father wasn't that thei were better peopl than those who came befor them __PUNCT__ it that thei realiz precis that thei did not have a greater claim to virtu __PUNCT__ and that the peopl who follow them weren't like to be ani more virtuou than thei were __PUNCT__
that critic insight led them to realiz someth import about power __PUNCT__ if it exercis isn't limit __PUNCT__ it will becom absolut __PUNCT__
becaus power alwai tri to expand __PUNCT__
it a law of natur __PUNCT__ of human natur __PUNCT__
as jame madison wrote in the federalist no __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ w __PUNCT__ hat is govern but the greatest reflect of all on human natur __PUNCT__ if men were angel __PUNCT__ no govern would be necessari __PUNCT__
if angel were to govern men __PUNCT__ no intern or extern control on govern would be necessari __PUNCT__
in frame a govern which is to be administ by men over men __PUNCT__ the great difficulti li in thi __PUNCT__ you must first enabl the govern to control the govern __PUNCT__ and in the next place oblig it to control itself __PUNCT__
the founder saw the truth of thi insight plai out in their lifetim __PUNCT__ in the arbitrari exercis of power by king georg iii __PUNCT__ and in the omin rise to power of napoleon in franc __PUNCT__
our parent __PUNCT__ gener saw it in the rise of hitler and stalin __PUNCT__ and in the post __PUNCT__ war twilight struggl against commun __PUNCT__
we seen it in our gener in the reign of the taliban in afghanistan __PUNCT__ of saddam hussein in iraq __PUNCT__ of kim jong il in north korea and the reign of the mullah in iran __PUNCT__
we see it most starkli todai in osama bin laden vision of a global mediev caliph __PUNCT__
there ar cultur differ in other part of the world __PUNCT__ to be sure __PUNCT__ and we must adjust our tactic base on our understand of those differ __PUNCT__
but there ar some basic underli truth __PUNCT__ unlimit govern confer unlimit power on it leader to impos their will on other __PUNCT__
that on truth __PUNCT__
here anoth __PUNCT__ peopl gener don't want to live their live in the crosshair of govern oppress __PUNCT__
thei want to be free to make for themselv and their children __PUNCT__ by their own decis __PUNCT__ talent and industri __PUNCT__ a better futur than thei inherit __PUNCT__
the solut that our founder devis guid us to thi dai __PUNCT__ limit govern __PUNCT__
understand the natur tendenc of power to expand __PUNCT__ the founder design our govern to restrain it __PUNCT__
thei creat a feder govern of enumer power __PUNCT__ of three branch whose reach wa limit by the power of the other branch __PUNCT__ by the power reserv to the state __PUNCT__ and by the right reserv to individu __PUNCT__
thei divid the power to make war between congress and the execut __PUNCT__ make the presid the command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief but give congress the power to rais and fund armi and declar war __PUNCT__
thei gave congress the power to rais and appropri monei to support the govern but the presid the power to spend __PUNCT__
thei gave the presid the power to negoti treati __PUNCT__ but the senat the power to ratifi or reject those treati __PUNCT__
thei gave the presid the power to appoint judg __PUNCT__ but the senat the power of advic and consent __PUNCT__
thei enumer certain baselin individu right __PUNCT__ but instruct that thi list wa not exhaust __PUNCT__ and thei provid that the right and power that were not enumer were reserv strictli to the state and the peopl __PUNCT__
thei creat court of limit jurisdict __PUNCT__ which could hear onli __PUNCT__ case or controversi __PUNCT__ aris under __PUNCT__ the constitut __PUNCT__
the further develop of the common law we inherit from england __PUNCT__ and the scope of the individu right reserv to the state __PUNCT__ were question left to the individu state __PUNCT__ remov from the jurisdict of the feder court __PUNCT__
by limit govern in these wai __PUNCT__ the founder attempt to assur that no on branch could domin the other __PUNCT__ that the feder govern could not usurp state power __PUNCT__ and that on individu assert hi right could stop the entir machineri of govern from take awai hi freedom __PUNCT__
why ha the appoint of judg becom such a flashpoint of controversi in the past twenti year or so __PUNCT__ when you understand our system in the wai i just describ __PUNCT__ when you see the wisdom in it and the humil it requir of public servant __PUNCT__ it easi enough to understand why we ar so concern that the judg we appoint share that understand of the natur and limit of power __PUNCT__
some basic attribut of judg follow from thi understand __PUNCT__
thei should be peopl who respect the limit scope afford feder judg under the constitut __PUNCT__
thei should be peopl who understand that the founder __PUNCT__ concern about the expans tendenc of power extend to judici power as well as to execut or legisl power __PUNCT__
thei should be peopl who ar humbl by their role in our system __PUNCT__ not embolden by it __PUNCT__
our freedom is curtail no less by an act of arbitrari judici power as it is by an act of an arbitrari execut __PUNCT__ or legisl __PUNCT__ or state power __PUNCT__
for that reason __PUNCT__ a judg decis must rest on more than hi subject convict that he is right __PUNCT__ or hi eager to address a perceiv social ill __PUNCT__
thi truth wa well understood by chief justic robert __PUNCT__ mentor __PUNCT__ my fellow arizonan chief justic william rehnquist __PUNCT__ whose pass we mourn __PUNCT__
dure hi __NUM__ year on the court __PUNCT__ justic rehnquist gain respect for hi sharp intellect __PUNCT__ hi strong sens of fair __PUNCT__ and hi enorm devot to the court and to public servic __PUNCT__
hi profound understand of the balanc inher in feder __PUNCT__ between the state and the feder govern __PUNCT__ as well as between the three feder branchesâ??left us a strong legaci __PUNCT__
it a legaci i hope will be respect by the judg presid bush ha nomin __PUNCT__ and in whom we have vest great trust to discharg their judici duti with prudenc and principl __PUNCT__
i am proud of my role in persuad my fellow republican senat to respect the limit of our own power and not abolish the filibust rule __PUNCT__ chang which promis to empow a differ major under anoth presid to imped our caus of limit govern and constrain judici power __PUNCT__
instead we have focus with consider success on assur that a high percentag of the presid nomine have been confirm __PUNCT__
and those judg and justic will interpret our constitut as our founder intend __PUNCT__
the effort we undertook a year and a half ago __PUNCT__ work with senat of both parti __PUNCT__ who were concern about abus of the filibust tradit __PUNCT__ result in a substanti increas in the confirm of the presid circuit court nomine __PUNCT__
priscilla owen __PUNCT__ janic roger brown __PUNCT__ and bill pryor have all been confirm __PUNCT__ and thi year brett kavanaugh wa confirm to the us court of appeal for the dc circuit __PUNCT__
the presid nomin these individu __PUNCT__ i support each of their nomin __PUNCT__ and we fought successfulli to confirm them __PUNCT__
presid bush now ha a higher percentag of hi nomin confirm to both the district court and the circuit court than did presid clinton dure hi presid __PUNCT__
i am also proud to see chief justic robert and associ justic alito serv with such distinct on the suprem court __PUNCT__
thei ar good peopl __PUNCT__ deserv peopl __PUNCT__ and their decis will be ground in the text and histori of the statut __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__ or constitut provis under consider __PUNCT__ and interpret narrowli in light of the specif fact of the case befor them __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ to paraphras mr __PUNCT__ madison __PUNCT__ if angel wrote law __PUNCT__ we wouldn't need judg at all __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ angel don't write law __PUNCT__ congress doe __PUNCT__
and we call a lot of thing __PUNCT__ but no on would mistak us for angel __PUNCT__
too frequent __PUNCT__ we write law that ar unclear __PUNCT__ we vote on law we haven't adequ debat __PUNCT__ and sometim __PUNCT__ i am sad to report __PUNCT__ we vote on law we haven't even read __PUNCT__
when we pass law like that __PUNCT__ we leav too much to the discret of our feder judg __PUNCT__
we fail in our role to ensur that the judiciari scope is limit __PUNCT__
as we debat reform to the practic and procedur of congress __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__ particularli we republican __PUNCT__ will take an honest look at how we fail to fulfil our constitut respons when we write law that invit judici activ and misinterpret __PUNCT__
why these restraint on feder judg __PUNCT__ becaus the structur of our govern __PUNCT__ by itself __PUNCT__ will not assur our freedom __PUNCT__
that structur __PUNCT__ while it reduc the likelihood of tyranni __PUNCT__ is onli as strong as our commit to the rule of law __PUNCT__ and the rule of law depend larg on our judiciari commit not to impos it will arbitrarili on us __PUNCT__
that why the appoint of feder judg ha becom such a flashpoint issu for so mani __PUNCT__
judg stand in our system where our commit to limit govern meet our commit to the rule of law __PUNCT__
to the extent that judg impos their own will __PUNCT__ thei undermin both the structur of limit govern and the rule of law __PUNCT__
histori teach us that without the rule of law there is noth â __PUNCT__ no form of oppress __PUNCT__ no form of physic suffer __PUNCT__ that peopl will not inflict upon on anoth __PUNCT__
i know thi to be true __PUNCT__
i see it in the appeal i receiv everi dai from support of human right advoc around the world who have been imprison __PUNCT__ tortur and murder for dare to challeng the tyranni of their govern __PUNCT__
i have seen it in countri such as burma __PUNCT__ where i have met with the woman who willingli surrend the privileg and comfort of life in the west but ha __PUNCT__ on behalf of her peopl __PUNCT__ refus to surrend voluntarili her inalien right to freedom __PUNCT__
and i saw it mani year ago __PUNCT__ as i watch men depriv of everi liberti __PUNCT__ who were routin tortur __PUNCT__ maintain their digniti and their loyalti to their countri __PUNCT__ and it ideal __PUNCT__
that is why __PUNCT__ i have been outspoken in opposit to us tortur against our enemi __PUNCT__
the moral strength that enabl peopl to stand up to tyranni in other countri resid in their convict that were the situat to be revers thei would not avail themselv of the abus of power that thei have suffer __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ american stand for someth in thi world __PUNCT__
we stand for a vision of human happi and potenti __PUNCT__ of human freedom __PUNCT__ base on limit the power of govern and respect the rule of law __PUNCT__
those ar the ideal i fought for in my youth __PUNCT__ and that i fight for todai __PUNCT__ at less person risk than face by the american who now stand a post in foreign countri in defens of our interest and ideal __PUNCT__
we best honor those who ar fight and dy in the desert of iraq and the mountain of afghanistan by not lose our wai __PUNCT__
we honor them by insist in our everi action __PUNCT__ from the appoint of feder judg to the trial of enemi combat __PUNCT__ that our ideal of limit govern under the rule of law continu to be respect __PUNCT__
so let resolv here todai not to lose our wai __PUNCT__
we in on hell of a mess in iraq __PUNCT__ and the american peopl told us loud and clear last week that thei ar not happi with the cours of thi war __PUNCT__
neither am i __PUNCT__
but let be clear __PUNCT__ that the limit of what thei told us about iraq and the war on terror __PUNCT__
the american peopl didn't tell us to forget the peopl we lost on 9/11 __PUNCT__ who were go about their live free to work and dream and love __PUNCT__ unawar that thei were the intend victim of a jihad __PUNCT__
thei didn't tell us to forget the sacrific of our soldier in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ or to choos a cours that would imperil their mission __PUNCT__
thei didn't tell us to abandon our friend in remot part of the world to moral monster like osama bin laden or to apostl of hate like the taliban who oppress everyth thei cannot understand __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ thei didn't tell us to forget our ideal of limit govern __PUNCT__
i think the american peopl want us to reaffirm who we ar __PUNCT__
so let do that todai __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that limit the reach of govern becaus govern by it natur will __PUNCT__ if permit __PUNCT__ limit the reach of the human heart __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that limit the reach of govern becaus we understand that no govern should have a right to impos itself between human be and their law aspir to make of their live what thei will __PUNCT__
we limit govern becaus the great of our countri __PUNCT__ our product __PUNCT__ resourc and compass __PUNCT__ is not a product of the state decre or prerog __PUNCT__ but deriv from the free exercis of the right and respons of liberti __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that limit govern so that govern cannot limit us __PUNCT__
i believ thi notion of limit govern will stand as our last contribut to the world __PUNCT__
we ar proof that peopl can frame a govern to serv as an instrument of the peopl __PUNCT__ not the other wai around __PUNCT__
and by our action both at home and abroad we will prove onc more __PUNCT__ as we did in the last centuri __PUNCT__ that regim like the nazi __PUNCT__ or the fascist __PUNCT__ or the soviet union __PUNCT__ or the taliban __PUNCT__ which place the interest of the state or a movement or a caus abov the right of the peopl __PUNCT__ is on the wrong side of histori __PUNCT__
america must remain ever vigil in the preserv of our govern ideal __PUNCT__
you must continu your good work in servic to that essenti work __PUNCT__ becaus you know someth that we here in washington too often forget __PUNCT__ that neither the court __PUNCT__ nor congress nor the presid can make us a great countri __PUNCT__
onli the american peopl can do that __PUNCT__ if we __PUNCT__ all three branch of govern __PUNCT__ safeguard their right __PUNCT__ which we have sworn an oath to do __PUNCT__
the endless rank of american who have di in servic to that ideal __PUNCT__ and who fight to defend it todai __PUNCT__ demand of us __PUNCT__ who do not share their sacrific __PUNCT__ that we us our talent and industri to keep that ideal inviol within the boundari of the countri thei have love so well __PUNCT__
i thank you for keep faith with their faith __PUNCT__ and for lend your heart and mind to the endur and nobl caus of preserv in our time the greatest experi in human histori __PUNCT__ govern of the peopl __PUNCT__ by the peopl and for the peopl __PUNCT__
