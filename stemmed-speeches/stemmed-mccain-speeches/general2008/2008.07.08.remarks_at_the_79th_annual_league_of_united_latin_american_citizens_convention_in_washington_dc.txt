thank you __PUNCT__
i veri pleas to be here to discuss with you some of the issu in thi campaign that most concern american __PUNCT__ particularli the issu that worri us the most __PUNCT__ the american economi __PUNCT__
all of us know what is happen to the economi __PUNCT__
it is slow __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ peopl have lost their job sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and the rate of new job creation ha fallen sharpli __PUNCT__
some economist have note that compani seem to be on a __PUNCT__ hire strike __PUNCT__
american ar worri about the secur of their current job __PUNCT__ and thei worri that thei __PUNCT__ their kid and their neighbor mai not find good job and new opportun in the futur __PUNCT__
to make matter wors __PUNCT__ ga is over __MONEY__ a gallon and the price of oil ha nearli doubl in the last year __PUNCT__
the cost of everyth from energi to food is rise __PUNCT__
i have a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__ creat more and better job __PUNCT__ and get america move again __PUNCT__
i have a plan to reform govern __PUNCT__ achiev energi secur __PUNCT__ and ensur that healthcar and a qualiti educ ar afford and avail for all __PUNCT__
i believ the role of govern is to unleash the creativ __PUNCT__ ingenu and hard work of the american peopl __PUNCT__ and make it easier to creat job __PUNCT__
at it core __PUNCT__ the economi isn't the sum of an arrai of bewild statist __PUNCT__
it about where american work __PUNCT__ how thei live __PUNCT__ how the pai their bill todai and save for tomorrow __PUNCT__
it about small busi open their door __PUNCT__ hire employe and grow __PUNCT__
it about give worker the educ and train to find a good job and prosper in it __PUNCT__
it about the aspir of the american peopl to build a better life for their famili __PUNCT__ dream that begin with a job __PUNCT__
so how ar we go to creat good job __PUNCT__ let start with small busi __PUNCT__ which creat the major of all job __PUNCT__
a recent report sai small busi have creat __NUM__ job so far thi year while other sector ar lose job __PUNCT__
small busi ar the job engin of america __PUNCT__ and i will make it easier for them to grow and creat more job __PUNCT__
there ar two million latino own busi in america __PUNCT__ a number that is grow veri rapidli __PUNCT__
the first consider we should have when debat tax polici is how we can help those compani grow and increas the prosper of the million of american famili whose econom secur depend on their success __PUNCT__
it is a terribl mistak to rais tax dure an econom downturn __PUNCT__
increas the tax burden on american imped job growth __PUNCT__ discourag innov and make us less competit __PUNCT__
small busi ar the biggest job creator in our economi __PUNCT__
keep individu rate low isn't intend as a favor to wealthi american __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million small busi owner pai those rate __PUNCT__ and take more monei from them depriv them of the capit thei need to invest and grow and hire __PUNCT__
if you believ you should pai more tax __PUNCT__ i am the wrong candid for you __PUNCT__
job ar the most import thing our economi creat __PUNCT__
when you rais tax in a bad economi you elimin job __PUNCT__
i not go to let that happen __PUNCT__
i will keep current rate low and cut them where i can __PUNCT__
for those of you with children __PUNCT__ i will doubl the child deduct from __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ for everi depend __PUNCT__ in everi famili in america __PUNCT__
i will reduc the estat tax to fifteen percent __PUNCT__ so parent who have spent long year work hard to build a busi __PUNCT__ and provid a decent live to their employe __PUNCT__ can leav the product of a lifetim of labor and love to their children __PUNCT__
my health care plan is care not to impos greater burden on small busi __PUNCT__
a __PUNCT__ pai or plai __PUNCT__ health mandat on small busi would add a crush __MONEY__ to the cost of emploi anyon with a famili __PUNCT__
that would not onli prevent them from creat new job __PUNCT__ but will forc them to cut job __PUNCT__ and reduc the wage of current employe to pai for it __PUNCT__
i intend to make health care more avail to more american by make it more afford and portabl __PUNCT__
the answer is to get health care cost under control by creat real competit among insur compani __PUNCT__ reform the wai medic treatment is bill __PUNCT__ and help american famili make their own health care decis with a __MONEY__ tax credit __PUNCT__
our current busi tax rate __PUNCT__ the second highest in the world __PUNCT__ will postpon our recoveri from thi downturn and make us increasingli less competit in the world economi __PUNCT__
when a corpor plan to expand and hire more worker __PUNCT__ thei face a choic between build a new plant here at home or build it in a countri where thei will pai a third or a half the tax rate thei pai in america __PUNCT__
employ can hire more peopl __PUNCT__ or thei can pai more tax __PUNCT__
thei can rare do both __PUNCT__
we can no longer afford the luxuri of nostalgia for past time when american busi face littl seriou competit in the world __PUNCT__
i propos to reduc the busi tax rate from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the global economi is here to stai __PUNCT__
we cannot build wall to foreign competit __PUNCT__ and we shouldn't want to __PUNCT__
when have american ever been afraid of competit __PUNCT__ america is the biggest export __PUNCT__ import __PUNCT__ produc __PUNCT__ manufactur __PUNCT__ and innov in the world __PUNCT__
that why i reject the fals virtu of econom isolation __PUNCT__
ani confid __PUNCT__ compet countri and it govern should embrac competit __PUNCT__ it make us stronger __PUNCT__ not hide from our competitor and cheat our consum and worker __PUNCT__
we can compet and win __PUNCT__ as we alwai have __PUNCT__ or we can be left behind __PUNCT__
lower barrier to trade creat more and better job __PUNCT__ and higher wage __PUNCT__
it keep inflat under control __PUNCT__
it make good more afford for low and middl incom consum __PUNCT__
nineti __PUNCT__ five percent of the world consum live outsid the u. __PUNCT__
our futur prosper depend on open more of these market __PUNCT__ not close them __PUNCT__
for american who have lost their job to foreign competit __PUNCT__ i have propos a comprehens reform of our unemploy insur and worker retrain program __PUNCT__
we will us our commun colleg to help train worker for specif opportun in their commun __PUNCT__
and for worker of a certain ag who have lost a job that won't come back __PUNCT__ we help make up the differ in wage between their old job and a temporari __PUNCT__ lower paid on until thei complet retrain and found secur new employ at a decent wage __PUNCT__
in the global economi what you learn is what you earn __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ studi show that half of hispan and half of african american enter high school do not graduat with their class __PUNCT__
by the __NUM__ grade __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ student in math and scienc score near the bottom of all industri nation __PUNCT__
mani parent fear their children won't have the same opportun thei had __PUNCT__
that is unaccept in a countri as great as our __PUNCT__
in mani school __PUNCT__ particularli where peopl ar struggl the hardest __PUNCT__ the situat is dire __PUNCT__ and i believ pose the civil right challeng of our time __PUNCT__
we need to shake up fail school bureaucraci with competit __PUNCT__ hold school account for result __PUNCT__ strengthen math __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ technolog and engin curriculum __PUNCT__ empow parent with choic __PUNCT__ remov barrier to qualifi instructor __PUNCT__ attract and reward superior teacher __PUNCT__ and have a fair but sure process to weed out incompet __PUNCT__
few problem hurt american more than our danger depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ and the rapid and dramat increas in the price of gasolin it ha caus __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ the crisi hurt lower incom american __PUNCT__ who often drive the furthest to work and own the oldest car __PUNCT__
but becaus the cost of almost everyth is affect directli by the cost of oil __PUNCT__ the qualiti of life for mani million of american and the growth and hire plan of million of small busi ar suffer __PUNCT__
our depend on foreign oil ha been thirti year in the make __PUNCT__ and wa caus by the failur of politician in washington to think long term about the futur of the countri __PUNCT__
if we don't act now to achiev energi secur __PUNCT__ we ar put our nation secur __PUNCT__ our economi and our environ at grave risk __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ america demand for energi will rise by nearli twenti percent __PUNCT__
our job and our veri wai of life depend on the next presid beginnin g to solv thi challeng __PUNCT__

the geniu __PUNCT__ hard work and courag of american have never fail us __PUNCT__ and will not fail us now __PUNCT__
let me close by talk briefli about my respect and gratitud for the contribut of hispan __PUNCT__ american to the cultur __PUNCT__ economi and secur of the countri i have serv all my adult life __PUNCT__
i repres arizona where spanish wa spoken befor english wa __PUNCT__ and where the charact and prosper of our state ow a great deal to the mani arizonan of hispan descent who live there __PUNCT__
and i know thi countri __PUNCT__ which i love more than almost anyth __PUNCT__ would be the poorer were we depriv of the patriot __PUNCT__ industri and decenc of those million of american whose famili came here from other countri in our hemispher __PUNCT__
i will honor their contribut to america for as long as i live __PUNCT__
i and mani other colleagu twice attempt to pass comprehens immigr legisl to fix our broken border __PUNCT__ ensur respect for the law of thi countri __PUNCT__ recogn the import econom necess of immigr labor __PUNCT__ apprehend those who came here illeg to commit crime __PUNCT__ and deal practic and human with those who came here __PUNCT__ as my distant ancestor did __PUNCT__ to build a better __PUNCT__ safer life for their famili __PUNCT__ without excus the fact thei came here illeg or grant them privileg befor those who have been wait their turn outsid the countri __PUNCT__
mani american __PUNCT__ with good caus __PUNCT__ did not believ us when we said we would secur our border __PUNCT__ and so we fail in our effort __PUNCT__
we must prove to them that we can and will secur our border first __PUNCT__ while respect the digniti and right of citizen and legal resid of the unit state __PUNCT__
but we must not make the mistak of think that our respons to meet thi challeng will end with that accomplish __PUNCT__
we have econom and humanitarian respons as well __PUNCT__ and thei requir no less dedic from us in meet them __PUNCT__
when i wa in prison in vietnam __PUNCT__ i like other of my fellow pow __PUNCT__ wa offer earli releas by my captor __PUNCT__

my friend __PUNCT__ everett alvarez __PUNCT__ a brave american of mexican descent __PUNCT__ had been shot down year befor i wa __PUNCT__ and had suffer for hi countri much more and much longer than i had __PUNCT__
to leav him behind would have shame us __PUNCT__
when you take the solemn stroll along that wall of black granit on the nation mall __PUNCT__ it is hard not to notic the mani name such as rodriguez __PUNCT__ hernandez __PUNCT__ and lopez that so sadli adorn it __PUNCT__
when you visit iraq and afghanistan you will meet some of the thousand of hispan __PUNCT__ american who serv there __PUNCT__ and mani of those who risk their live to protect the rest of us do not yet possess the right and privileg of full citizenship in the countri thei love so well __PUNCT__
to love your countri __PUNCT__ as i discov in vietnam __PUNCT__ is to love your countrymen __PUNCT__
those men and women ar my brother and sister __PUNCT__ my fellow american __PUNCT__ an associ that mean more to me than ani other __PUNCT__
as a privat citizen or as your presid __PUNCT__ i will never __PUNCT__ never do anyth to dishonor our oblig to them and their famili or to forget what thei and their ancestor have done to make thi countri the beauti __PUNCT__ bounti __PUNCT__ bless place we love __PUNCT__
