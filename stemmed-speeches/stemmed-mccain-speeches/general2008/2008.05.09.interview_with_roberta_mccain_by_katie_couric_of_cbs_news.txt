thei just went until the war wa over __PUNCT__
but he came back __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ two time or three time __PUNCT__

sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ to get new submarin __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ submarin command would get new submarin to replac hi older on __PUNCT__

__URL__ it need mainten that actual __PUNCT__ thi is what so wonder about our countri __PUNCT__
when i see how mani year it take to build someth or fix a bridg __PUNCT__ thei put out a new submarin everi singl solitari month in world war ii __PUNCT__
so you would take three or four at sea __PUNCT__

and so it wasn't __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ todai it kind of uniqu __PUNCT__

mccain __PUNCT__ i had kind of a defin experi mani year ago where a fellow came to my offic name david ifshin __PUNCT__ phonet spell __PUNCT__ who had been on of the leader of the sd __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ mani of our viewer won't even recal that that wa a veri larg anti __PUNCT__ vietnam war movement __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and we sat down we talk __PUNCT__
and he said __PUNCT__ i think we ought to put our differ behind us __PUNCT__
and i did __PUNCT__
and we work togeth to try to help human right in vietnam __PUNCT__
to help the buddhist end __PUNCT__
and to restor normal relat __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ david __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ di at a veri earli ag __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ feel so much better that david and i had a reconcili and were abl to work togeth __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i have differ with some of my colleagu in the senat __PUNCT__
and i not close friend with some of them __PUNCT__ to sai the least __PUNCT__
but i think it import to __PUNCT__ when you have differ __PUNCT__ to put them asid and move on __PUNCT__
and that wa hard for me to learn __PUNCT__
but i final did __PUNCT__
i think i a better person for that __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__ dure your son captiv __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ you had to believ in your heart that he had di to get through everi dai __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i onli thought he had di the first two dai __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ oh realli __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ the first __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ how were you abl to get through all those year when your son wa in captiv __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i do have faith __PUNCT__
i have faith in god will and that all i ask for __PUNCT__
i don't have particular thing i ask for __PUNCT__
and if i profess that i have faith then i have to do it __PUNCT__
and it like these __PUNCT__ all these other thing __PUNCT__ peopl __PUNCT__ thei go __PUNCT__ those thing weren't veri hard for me __PUNCT__
i just __PUNCT__ if you can't do someth about someth __PUNCT__ don't wast your time on it __PUNCT__
and i couldn't do anyth about that __PUNCT__
i could maintain my digniti and the thing that i alwai claim that i believ in __PUNCT__ god and my countri __PUNCT__
and i believ in the vietnam war __PUNCT__
and on pretti good proof about the domino theori is __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ cambodia and vietnam what todai ar communist __PUNCT__
and thei weren't befor the vietnam war start __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ is it true __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ and kati might be interest __PUNCT__ and that on of the thing is that with most peopl you didn't talk about me __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ oh no __PUNCT__
i never said a word to anybodi __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ wasn't that hard __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ why bring it up __PUNCT__ couric __PUNCT__ how worri were you __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ about your mom and dad and three young children __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i wa most worri about my famili and that thei didn't know what wa happen to me __PUNCT__
and i think that wa harder __PUNCT__ in some wai __PUNCT__ on my father becaus he wa a command of all the u. __PUNCT__ forc in the pacif __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ he wa told to bomb __PUNCT__ order the bomb of b __PUNCT__ 52 in hanoi __PUNCT__
and he knew that i live in hanoi __PUNCT__
that my prison camp __PUNCT__ on of them __PUNCT__ wa there __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ he carri out __PUNCT__ those instruct and gave the order without hesit __PUNCT__
but it still pretti tough on a father __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ in some wai __PUNCT__ the strain on him wa __PUNCT__ in some wai more difficult and of greater __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ oh yeah __PUNCT__
everi singl night he prai on hi knee __PUNCT__
and i have __PUNCT__ a prayer book of hi __PUNCT__ an episcop prayer book where __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ your hand final will just be oil __PUNCT__ and wear the paper out __PUNCT__ those paper ar just worn out __PUNCT__
thei were just __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ so it wa tough on him __PUNCT__
but he wa a veri brave person and dedic to the navi __PUNCT__
and i know it mayb a littl off the subject __PUNCT__ but it wa a gener that he repres of the pre __PUNCT__ world war ii naval offic __PUNCT__ militari offic __PUNCT__
thei all came from the same place __PUNCT__
either west point or the naval academi __PUNCT__
and certainli thei had their fail and flaw __PUNCT__
but there wa a certain kind of __PUNCT__ apolit attitud that most of that gener had of pre world war ii militari offic __PUNCT__
my mom mai disput with me __PUNCT__ but i think herman wolk book __PUNCT__ wind of war is on of __PUNCT__ and war and remembr is on of those great stori where you kind of get that flavor __PUNCT__
i recommend it veri __PUNCT__ veri highli __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ don't you think __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
when he sai that the militari wa apolit __PUNCT__ it wa __PUNCT__
on an offic __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ report thei would put pi __PUNCT__ which meant polit influenc __PUNCT__ and thei scorn it __PUNCT__
and that wa a mark against you __PUNCT__
i don't ever rememb polit be __PUNCT__
discuss in my whole marri life __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ it realli about honor __PUNCT__ wasn't it __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and it __PUNCT__
wasn't all perfect __PUNCT__
we weren't readi for world war ii __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__
that wasn't so much the militari fault __PUNCT__ but also it wa a kind of insular __PUNCT__
and it wa good for the militari __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ to take and have the offic corp from __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ all walk of societi __PUNCT__
from colleg and given more enlist peopl __PUNCT__
there were still some __PUNCT__
but more enlist peopl to becom offic __PUNCT__
so i think __PUNCT__ overal __PUNCT__ it wa an improv __PUNCT__
but there wa kind of some uniqu qualiti about the pre world war ii militari offic that wa veri interest and admir __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ let talk about polit and thi campaign __PUNCT__
as you both know __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain ag ha been brought up quit a bit __PUNCT__ becaus he will be the oldest presid ever elect to a first term if he win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
ha your mom given you some good tip on stai fit __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ she certainli is an exampl i site quit frequent __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ when the subject come up __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ as you can tell __PUNCT__ she in excel health __PUNCT__
and i claim that i inherit all those gene from her __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ you don't like when your son ag is brought up __PUNCT__ do you __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i don't mind __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ in polit there ar pluse and there ar minus __PUNCT__
and it true __PUNCT__
on year old could have a minu __PUNCT__
but when you think about the experi __PUNCT__ and what he accomplish __PUNCT__ and the legisl that he been abl to get through __PUNCT__ as oppos to a man who __PUNCT__ two year ago wa in the state legislatur at __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__
so that is a big minu in my view of __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ that why i have to take her with me wherev i go __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ with someon with so littl experi __PUNCT__
and then who ha the most liber of record of vote in the unit state __PUNCT__
and i no liber __PUNCT__
so of cours i think that it over __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ on the republican side __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ you speak your mind don't you __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i know that __PUNCT__ back in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you said the republican base wa offer no help whatsoev __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ that true __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ __URL__ your son __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now that he becom the nomine do you think he get the help he need __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__
i realli don't know __PUNCT__
and i not equivoc __PUNCT__
i don't know anyth about it __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ do you feel __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ that the republican parti is behind him enough __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ i think thei ar a lot wiser than i am __PUNCT__
and thei know __PUNCT__
how to do thi __PUNCT__
i don't __PUNCT__
so i realli __PUNCT__ and i not realli try to get out of thi __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ haven't thought about it __PUNCT__
and i would assum that thei know what thei do __PUNCT__ and thei do the wai that thi should be run polit __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ do you ever sai __PUNCT__ mom __PUNCT__ pleas zip it __PUNCT__ roberta mccain __PUNCT__ it won't do him ani good __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i wa gonna sai __PUNCT__ i think at __NUM__ she probabl ha earn the right to express her view __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ mom __PUNCT__ if i could just add on __PUNCT__ i think our parti __PUNCT__ is unit __PUNCT__
i think we have a lot of work to do __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__
but primari ar alwai tough __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__
we pretti much togeth __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__
i don't know __PUNCT__
i assum that it the wai it should be __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ some of your oppon __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ have said that you ar the equival of a third bush term __PUNCT__
how can you convinc voter that you not gonna be more of the same __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ a view of my record __PUNCT__ which there ha been differ on climat chang __PUNCT__ or the war __PUNCT__ or spend __PUNCT__
but the import thing i think about everi elect __PUNCT__ and thi on probabl more so than mani recent is that how we gonna have a plan of action and vision for the futur __PUNCT__
american ar go through a veri tough time now __PUNCT__
hous issu __PUNCT__
peopl ar sit around the kitchen tabl who have just lost their job recent and suddenli __PUNCT__
so i think thei veri interest in what you can do to help them better themselv and their live and their futur __PUNCT__
and i think that what most voter would focu on __PUNCT__
and i have to give them that vision __PUNCT__
and i have the vision and the plan of action __PUNCT__
but i got about six month now __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ in order to convinc them __PUNCT__
and it gonna be a tough job __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ i know you talk about thi __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
i want to give you just a moment to clarifi it __PUNCT__
often the critic against you __PUNCT__ vi __PUNCT__ à __PUNCT__ vi iraq __PUNCT__ is that you go to commit u. __PUNCT__ troop for an addit __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
what exactli did you sai and why do you think that been so misinterpret __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ what i wa sai and what i sai todai is that after we win the war in iraq __PUNCT__ when thei have an esca __PUNCT__ a secur arrang with the iraqi after the korean war we kept troop in south korea __PUNCT__
it wa a buffer for our secur __PUNCT__
after the war in first gulf war we have a base in kuwait __PUNCT__
it not american presenc __PUNCT__
it is american causal that american care about __PUNCT__
and i gonna win thi war __PUNCT__
and i gonna bring our troop home and i gonna bring them home honor __PUNCT__
and if we do what sen __PUNCT__ obama and sen __PUNCT__ clinton want to do __PUNCT__ i am convinc that we will be back with greater sacrific of american blood and treasur __PUNCT__
and a year ago __PUNCT__ kati __PUNCT__ i said to you i would much rather lose a polit campaign than lose a war __PUNCT__
we ar succeed in iraq __PUNCT__
and i not go to take a cours of action that i believ will endang american live and caus us to have more sacrific __PUNCT__
and i convinc to that __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ what do you sai __PUNCT__ a troop presenc __PUNCT__ how mani troop ar we talk about senat __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ it would depend on the secur arrang __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ the same kind of deal we have with south korea __PUNCT__
we have with kuwait __PUNCT__
we have with japan __PUNCT__
we have with germani __PUNCT__
we have troop __PUNCT__ as the world super power __PUNCT__ in a lot of place in the world __PUNCT__
after the war is over __PUNCT__ and it will be over __PUNCT__ and we will bring the troop home with __PUNCT__ honor and victori __PUNCT__ then we will discuss those arrang with the iraqi __PUNCT__ just as we did after the korean war with the south korean govern __PUNCT__
and i don't know of anyon who object to have american troop in south korea __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ you were born befor women had the right to vote __PUNCT__
roberta mccain __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ and i just curiou how you feel about the first seriou femal candid for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ just the veri notion of that how __PUNCT__
