it is a pleasur to be here thi afternoon __PUNCT__
i know you have heard from a number of my friend and colleagu todai __PUNCT__ governor huckabe and romnei __PUNCT__ senat kai bailei hutchison __PUNCT__ ambassador john bolton __PUNCT__ and kentucki own __PUNCT__ senat republican leader mitch mcconnel __PUNCT__
and you have heard from an american hero __PUNCT__ greg stubb __PUNCT__ who sacrif greatli so that american might be secur in our freedom __PUNCT__
we wish him well in hi recoveri __PUNCT__
at the outset __PUNCT__ let me recogn the life of a great american __PUNCT__ charlton heston __PUNCT__
all american rememb him as a great actor __PUNCT__ and for the memor role he plai __PUNCT__
mani of us also rememb him as a man who stood up for the oppress __PUNCT__
he march for civil right in the 1960 __PUNCT__
and hi firm commit to defend the constitut right of american __PUNCT__ all american and all constitut right __PUNCT__ led him to serv as presid of the nra __PUNCT__
it wa not a popular stand at the time with mani of hi friend in hollywood __PUNCT__ but hi principl matter more to him than popular __PUNCT__
we will miss charlton heston __PUNCT__ and we can best honor him by honor the good he did and the caus he serv __PUNCT__
when i first ran for congress in __NUM__ i wa proud to have the support of gun owner __PUNCT__
for more than two decad __PUNCT__ i oppos effort to ban gun __PUNCT__ ban ammunit __PUNCT__ ban magazin __PUNCT__ and dismiss gun owner as some kind of fring group unwelcom in __PUNCT__ modern __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__
the second amend isn't some archaic custom that matter onli to rural american __PUNCT__ who find solac in firearm out of frustrat with their econom circumst __PUNCT__
the second amend is uniqu in the world __PUNCT__
it guarante an individu right to keep and bear arm __PUNCT__
to argu anyth els is to reject the clear mean of our found father __PUNCT__
self __PUNCT__ relianc is the ethic that made america great __PUNCT__ and our founder understood that __PUNCT__
thei knew there would be circumst where american might need to us firearm to protect themselv and their famili __PUNCT__
some second amend detractor think thi is a mere abstract __PUNCT__ or a relic of america distant past __PUNCT__
but american exercis their second amend right everi dai to protect themselv from crimin __PUNCT__ as happen in scottsdal __PUNCT__ arizona where earlier thi year __PUNCT__ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old woman defend her home from a man who repeatedli attempt to break in __PUNCT__ extort monei and threaten to set fire to her garag __PUNCT__
the second amend __PUNCT__ and it guarante of an individu right to keep and bear arm __PUNCT__ is certainli not an abstract __PUNCT__
but the clear mean of the second amend ha not stop those who want to punish firearm owner __PUNCT__ and those who make and sell firearm __PUNCT__ for the action of crimin __PUNCT__
it seem like everi time there is a particularli violent crime __PUNCT__ the anti __PUNCT__ gun activist demand yet anoth restrict on the second amend __PUNCT__
i oppos the ban on so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ assault weapon __PUNCT__ which wa first propos after a california schoolyard shoot __PUNCT__
it make no sens to ban a class of firearm base on cosmet featur __PUNCT__
i have oppos wait period for gun purchas __PUNCT__
i have oppos effort to crippl our firearm manufactur by make them liabl for the act of violent crimin __PUNCT__
thi wa a not __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ cleverli disguis effort by some to us lawsuit to bankrupt gun manufactur __PUNCT__
thei su gun manufactur to hold them legal respons for the action of lawbreak __PUNCT__
had thei prevail __PUNCT__ thei would have bankrupt manufactur __PUNCT__ driven the cost of gun and ammunit sky high __PUNCT__ and forc govern and militari custom to bui from foreign sourc __PUNCT__
like your member __PUNCT__ i am a commit conservationist __PUNCT__
i have long support multipl us for public land that ensur thei ar avail for thi and futur gener to hunt __PUNCT__ fish and explor __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ million hunter in the unit state contribut __MONEY__ billion to the economi __PUNCT__ much of it in rural area __PUNCT__
hunter pai billion of dollar in feder revenu through licens and other fee __PUNCT__
here in kentucki __PUNCT__ hunter spend over __MONEY__ million and support thousand of job __PUNCT__
senat obama and clinton claim thei support our hunt heritag __PUNCT__ but thei vote to allow lawsuit that would forc american gunmak out of busi and to ban ammunit commonli us for hunt __PUNCT__
their vote reveal their real view __PUNCT__ far more than their occasion statement of theoret support for the second amend heard on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
over the year __PUNCT__ i haven't agre with the nra on everi issu __PUNCT__
i have support effort to have nic background check appli to gun sale at gun show __PUNCT__
i recogn that gun show ar enjoi by million of law __PUNCT__ abid american __PUNCT__
i do not support effort by those who seek to regul them out of exist __PUNCT__
but i believ an accur __PUNCT__ fair and instant background check at gun show is a reason requir __PUNCT__
i also oppos effort to requir feder regul of all privat sale such as the transfer between a father and son or husband and wife __PUNCT__
i support campaign financ reform becaus i strongli believ our system of financ campaign wa influenc elect offici to put the interest of __PUNCT__ soft monei __PUNCT__ donor ahead of the public interest __PUNCT__
it is neither my purpos nor the purpos of the legisl to prevent gun owner or ani other group of citizen from make their voic heard in the legisl process __PUNCT__
those disagr do not detract from my long record of support for the second amend and the work we have done togeth to protect the right of gun owner from the polit attitud of the moment in washington that view the second amend as a onc quaint custom that must now yield to the judgment of modern enlighten opinion __PUNCT__
we have real differ with the democrat candid for presid __PUNCT__
thei have learn someth sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thei don't talk about their plan for gun control __PUNCT__
thei claim to support hunter and gun owner __PUNCT__
but just becaus thei don't talk about gun control doesn't mean thei won't support gun control __PUNCT__
let be clear __PUNCT__
if either senat clinton or senat obama is elect presid __PUNCT__ the right of law __PUNCT__ abid gun owner will be at risk __PUNCT__
thei have both vote as senat to ban gun or ban ammunit or to allow gun maker to be su out of exist __PUNCT__
it seem everi elect __PUNCT__ politician who support restrict on the second amend dress up in camouflag and pose with gun to demonstr thei care about hunter __PUNCT__ even though few gun owner fall for such obviou polit theater __PUNCT__
after senat obama made hi unfortun comment that pennsylvanian __PUNCT__ cling to gun and religion __PUNCT__ out of bitter __PUNCT__ senat clinton quickli affirm her support for the second amend __PUNCT__
that drew senat obama deris __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ she run around talk about how thi is an insult to sportsmen __PUNCT__ how she valu the second amend __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ like she on the duck blind everi sundai __PUNCT__ packin __PUNCT__ a six shooter __PUNCT__ someon should tell senat obama that duck ar usual hunt with shotgun __PUNCT__
senat obama hope he can get awai with have it both wai __PUNCT__
he sai he believ that the second amend confer an individu right to bear arm __PUNCT__
but when he had a chanc to weigh in on the most import second amend case befor the u. __PUNCT__ suprem court in decad __PUNCT__ district of columbia v __PUNCT__ heller __PUNCT__ senat obama dodg the question by claim __PUNCT__ i don't like take a stand on pend case __PUNCT__
he refus to sign the amicu brief sign by a bipartisan group of __NUM__ senat argu that the suprem court should overturn the dc gun ban in the heller case __PUNCT__
when he wa run for the state senat in illinoi __PUNCT__ hi campaign fill out a questionnair ask whether he support legisl to ban the manufactur __PUNCT__ sale and possess of handgun with simpl __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
the heller case should be decid soon __PUNCT__
but howev that case is decid __PUNCT__ the feder judiciari will continu to be an import forum for protect second amend right __PUNCT__
the next presid will appoint liter hundr of feder judg __PUNCT__ and is like to have the opportun to nomin on or more suprem court justic __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ the constitut restraint on power is as fundament as the exercis of power __PUNCT__ and often more so __PUNCT__
yet the framer knew these restraint would not alwai be observ __PUNCT__
thei were idealist __PUNCT__ but thei were worldli men as well __PUNCT__ and thei knew that abus of power and effort to encroach on individu right would aris and need to be firmli check __PUNCT__
their design for democraci wa drawn from their experi with tyranni __PUNCT__
a suspicion of power is ingrain in both the letter and spirit of the american constitut __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ their grand solut wa to alloc feder power three wai __PUNCT__ reserv all other power and right to the state and to the peopl themselv __PUNCT__
the execut __PUNCT__ legisl __PUNCT__ and judici branch ar often wari of on anoth excess __PUNCT__ seek to keep each other within bound __PUNCT__
the framer knew exactli what thei were do __PUNCT__ and the system of check and balanc rare disappoint __PUNCT__
quit rightli __PUNCT__ the proper role of the judiciari ha becom on of the defin issu of thi presidenti elect __PUNCT__
it will fall to the next presid to nomin qualifi men and women to the feder court __PUNCT__ and the choic we make will reach far into the futur __PUNCT__
my two prospect oppon and i have veri differ idea about the natur and proper exercis of judici power __PUNCT__
we would nomin judg of a differ kind __PUNCT__ a differ calib __PUNCT__ a differ understand of judici author and it limit __PUNCT__
and the peopl of america __PUNCT__ voter in both parti whose wish and convict ar so often disregard by unelect judg __PUNCT__ ar entitl to know what those differ ar __PUNCT__
feder court ar charg with appli the constitut and law of our countri to each case at hand __PUNCT__
but a court is hardli compet to check the abus of other branch of govern if it cannot control it own judici activ __PUNCT__
real activist seek to make their case democrat __PUNCT__ to win heart __PUNCT__ mind __PUNCT__ and major to their caus __PUNCT__
such peopl throughout our histori have often shown great ideal and done great good __PUNCT__
by contrast __PUNCT__ activist lawyer and activist judg follow a differ method __PUNCT__
thei want to be spare the inconveni of campaign __PUNCT__ elect __PUNCT__ legisl vote __PUNCT__ and all of that __PUNCT__
some feder judg oper by fiat __PUNCT__ shrug off gener of legal wisdom and preced while expect their own opinion to go unquest __PUNCT__
the decis of our suprem court in particular can be as close to perman as anyth govern doe __PUNCT__
and in the presidenti select of those who will write those decis __PUNCT__ a hunch __PUNCT__ a hope __PUNCT__ and a good first impress ar not enough __PUNCT__
i will not seek the confid of the american peopl in my nomine until my own confid is complet __PUNCT__ until i am certain of my nomine abil __PUNCT__ wisdom __PUNCT__ and demonstr fidel to the constitut __PUNCT__
there ar mani other differ between my view and senat obama __PUNCT__
i favor lower tax __PUNCT__ less govern spend __PUNCT__ and less feder bureaucraci __PUNCT__
senat obama ha clearli state hi prefer for rais the tax burden on american __PUNCT__ increas govern spend and give the govern more author over the live of american famili and busi __PUNCT__
we have differ on health care __PUNCT__
i prefer to give american famili more control over their health care decis __PUNCT__
senat obama would prefer the govern exercis greater control __PUNCT__
senat obama would meet uncondition with some of the world worst dictat and state sponsor of terrorist __PUNCT__
i would not add to the prestig of those who support violent extremist or seek to destroi our alli __PUNCT__
but i would like to close my remark with an issu that i know is much on the mind of american __PUNCT__ the war in iraq __PUNCT__
senat obama ha said __PUNCT__ if elect __PUNCT__ he will withdraw american from iraq quickli no matter what the situat on the ground is and no matter what u. __PUNCT__ militari command advis __PUNCT__
but if we withdraw prematur from iraq __PUNCT__ al qaeda in iraq will surviv __PUNCT__ proclaim victori and continu to provok sectarian tension that __PUNCT__ while thei have been subdu by the success of the surg __PUNCT__ still exist __PUNCT__ and ar ripe for provoc by al qaeda __PUNCT__
civil war in iraq could easili descend into genocid __PUNCT__ and destabil the entir region as neighbor power come to the aid of their favor faction __PUNCT__
a reckless and prematur withdraw would be a terribl defeat for our secur interest and our valu __PUNCT__
iran will view it as a victori __PUNCT__ and the biggest state support of terrorist __PUNCT__ a countri with nuclear ambit and a state desir to destroi the sta te of israel __PUNCT__ will see it influenc in the middl east grow significantli __PUNCT__
the consequ of our defeat would threaten us for year __PUNCT__ and those who argu for prematur withdraw __PUNCT__ as both senat obama and clinton do __PUNCT__ ar argu for a cours that would eventu draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would entail far greater danger and sacrific than we have suffer to date __PUNCT__
thank to the counterinsurg instig by gener petreau __PUNCT__ after four year of terribl costli mistak __PUNCT__ we have a realist chanc to succe in help the forc of polit reconcili prevail in iraq __PUNCT__ and the democrat elect iraqi govern __PUNCT__ with a profession and compet iraqi armi __PUNCT__ impos it author throughout the countri and defend it border __PUNCT__
we have a realist chanc of deni al qaeda ani sanctuari in iraq __PUNCT__
we have a realist chanc of leav behind in iraq a forc for stabil and peac in the region __PUNCT__ and not a caus for a wider and far more danger war __PUNCT__
i do not argu against withdraw bec aus i am indiffer to war and the suffer it inflict on too mani american famili __PUNCT__
i hold my posit becaus i hate war __PUNCT__ and i know veri well and veri person how grievou it wage ar __PUNCT__
but i know __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ that we must sometim pai those wage to avoid pai even higher on later __PUNCT__
i want our soldier home __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ just as quickli as we can bring them back without risk everyth thei suffer for __PUNCT__ and burden them with greater sacrific in the year ahead __PUNCT__
that i will not do __PUNCT__
i have spent my life in servic to my countri __PUNCT__ and i will never __PUNCT__ never __PUNCT__ never risk her secur for the sake of my own ambit __PUNCT__
i will defend her __PUNCT__ and all her freedom __PUNCT__ so help me god __PUNCT__
and i ask you to help me in that good caus __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and god bless you __PUNCT__
