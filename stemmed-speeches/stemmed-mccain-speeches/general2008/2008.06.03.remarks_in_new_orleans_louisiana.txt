good even from the great citi of new orlean __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ we can sai with confid the primari season is over __PUNCT__ and the gener elect campaign ha begun __PUNCT__
i commend both senat obama and clinton for the long __PUNCT__ hard race thei have run __PUNCT__
senat obama ha impress mani american with hi eloqu and hi spirit campaign __PUNCT__
senat clinton ha earn great respect for her tenac and courag __PUNCT__
the media often overlook how compassion she spoke to the concern and dream of million of american __PUNCT__ and she deserv a lot more appreci than she sometim receiv __PUNCT__
as the father of three daughter __PUNCT__ i ow her a debt for inspir million of women to believ there is no opportun in thi great countri beyond their reach __PUNCT__
i am proud to call her my friend __PUNCT__
pundit and parti elder have declar that senat obama will be my oppon __PUNCT__
he will be a formid on __PUNCT__
but i readi for the challeng __PUNCT__ and determin to run thi race in a wai that doe credit to our campaign and to the proud __PUNCT__ decent and patriot peopl i ask to lead __PUNCT__
the decis face american in thi elect couldn't be more import to the futur secur and prosper of american famili __PUNCT__
thi is __PUNCT__ inde __PUNCT__ a chang elect __PUNCT__
no matter who win thi elect __PUNCT__ the direct of thi countri is go to chang dramat __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ the choic is between the right chang and the wrong chang __PUNCT__ between go forward and go backward __PUNCT__
america ha seen tough time befor __PUNCT__
we alwai known how to get through them __PUNCT__
and we alwai believ our best dai ar ahead of us __PUNCT__
i believ that still __PUNCT__
but we must rise to the occas __PUNCT__ as we alwai have __PUNCT__ chang what must be chang __PUNCT__ and make the futur better than the past __PUNCT__
the right chang recogn that mani of the polici and institut of our govern have fail __PUNCT__
thei have fail to keep up with the challeng of our time becaus mani of these polici were design for the problem and opportun of the mid to late __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ befor the end of the cold war __PUNCT__ befor the revolut in inform technolog and rise of the global economi __PUNCT__
the right kind of chang will initi widespread and innov reform in almost everi area of govern polici __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ the environ __PUNCT__ the tax code __PUNCT__ our public school __PUNCT__ our transport system __PUNCT__ disast relief __PUNCT__ govern spend and regul __PUNCT__ diplomaci __PUNCT__ the militari and intellig servic __PUNCT__
seriou and far __PUNCT__ reach reform ar need in so mani area of govern to meet our own challeng in our own time __PUNCT__
the ironi is that american have been experienc a lot of chang in their live attribut to these histor event __PUNCT__ and some of those chang have distress mani american famili __PUNCT__ job loss __PUNCT__ fail school __PUNCT__ prohibit expens health care __PUNCT__ pension at risk __PUNCT__ entitl program approach bankruptci __PUNCT__ rise ga and food price __PUNCT__ to name a few __PUNCT__
but your govern often act as if it is complet unawar of the chang and hardship in your live __PUNCT__
and when govern doe take notic __PUNCT__ often it onli make matter wors __PUNCT__
for too long __PUNCT__ we have let histori outrun our govern abil to keep up with it __PUNCT__
the right chang will stop imped american from do what thei have alwai done __PUNCT__ overcom everi obstacl to our progress __PUNCT__ turn challeng into opportun __PUNCT__ and by our own industri __PUNCT__ imagin and courag make a better countri and a safer world th an we inherit __PUNCT__
to keep our nation prosper __PUNCT__ strong and grow we have to rethink __PUNCT__ reform and reinvent __PUNCT__ the wai we educ our children __PUNCT__ train our worker __PUNCT__ deliv health care servic __PUNCT__ support retire __PUNCT__ fuel our transport network __PUNCT__ stimul research and develop __PUNCT__ and har new technolog __PUNCT__
to keep us safe we must rebuild the structur and mission of our militari __PUNCT__ the capabl of our intellig and law enforc agenc __PUNCT__ the reach and scope of our diplomaci __PUNCT__ the capac of all branch of govern to defend us __PUNCT__
we need to strengthen our allianc __PUNCT__ and preserv our moral credibl __PUNCT__
we must also prepar __PUNCT__ far better than we have __PUNCT__ to respond quickli and effect to a natur calam __PUNCT__
when american confront a catastroph thei have a right to expect basic compet from their govern __PUNCT__
firemen and policemen should be abl to commun with each other in an emerg __PUNCT__
we should be abl to deliv bottl water to dehydr babi and rescu the infirm from a hospit with no electr __PUNCT__
our disgrac failur to do so here in new orlean expos the incompet of govern at all level to meet even it most basic respons __PUNCT__
the wrong chang look not to the futur but to the past for solut that have fail us befor and will sure fail us again __PUNCT__
i have a few year on my oppon __PUNCT__ so i am surpris that a young man ha bought in to so mani fail idea __PUNCT__
like other befor him __PUNCT__ he seem to think govern is the answer to everi problem __PUNCT__ that govern should take our resourc and make our decis for us __PUNCT__
that type of chang doesn't trust american to know what is right or what is in their own best interest __PUNCT__
it the attitud of politician who ar sure of themselv but have littl faith in the wisdom __PUNCT__ decenc and common sens of free peopl __PUNCT__
that attitud creat the unrespons bureaucraci of big govern in the first place __PUNCT__
and that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
you will hear from my oppon campaign in everi speech __PUNCT__ everi interview __PUNCT__ everi press releas that i run for presid bush third term __PUNCT__
you will hear everi polici of the presid describ as the bush __PUNCT__ mccain polici __PUNCT__
why doe senat obama believ it so import to repeat that idea over and over again __PUNCT__ becaus he know it veri difficult to get american to believ someth thei know is fals __PUNCT__
so he tri to drum it into your mind by constantli repeat it rather than debat honestli the veri differ direct he and i would take the countri __PUNCT__
but the american peopl didn't get to know me yesterdai __PUNCT__ as thei ar just get to know senat obama __PUNCT__
thei know i have a long record of bipartisan problem solv __PUNCT__
thei seen me put our countri befor ani presid __PUNCT__ befor ani parti __PUNCT__ befor ani special interest __PUNCT__ befor my own interest __PUNCT__
thei might think me an imperfect servant of our countri __PUNCT__ which i sure am __PUNCT__
but i am her servant first __PUNCT__ last and alwai __PUNCT__
i have work with the presid to keep our nation safe __PUNCT__
but he and i have not seen ey to ey on mani issu __PUNCT__
we disagre over the conduct of the war in iraq and the treatment of detaine __PUNCT__ over out of control govern spend and budget gimmick __PUNCT__ over energi polici and climat chang __PUNCT__ over defens spend that favor defens contractor over the public good __PUNCT__
i disagre strongli with the bush administr mismanag of the war in iraq __PUNCT__
i call for the chang in strategi that is now __PUNCT__ at last __PUNCT__ succeed where the previou strategi had fail miser __PUNCT__
i wa critic for do so by republican __PUNCT__
i wa critic by democrat __PUNCT__
i wa critic by the press __PUNCT__
but i don't answer to them __PUNCT__
i answer to you __PUNCT__
and i would be asham to admit i knew what had to be done in iraq to spare us from a defeat that would endang us for year __PUNCT__ but i kept quiet becaus it wa too polit hard for me to do __PUNCT__
no ambit is more import to me than the secur of the countri i have defend all my adult life __PUNCT__
senat obama oppos the new strategi __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ after promis not to __PUNCT__ vote to deni fund to the soldier who have done a brilliant and brave job of carri it out __PUNCT__
yet in the last year we have seen the success of that plan as violenc ha fallen to a four year low __PUNCT__ sunni insurg have join us in the fight against al qaeda __PUNCT__ the iraqi armi ha taken the lead in place onc lost to sunni and shia extremist __PUNCT__ and the iraqi govern ha begun to make progress toward polit reconcili __PUNCT__
none of thi progress would have happen had we not chang cours over a year ago __PUNCT__
and all of thi progress would be lost if senat obama had hi wai and began to withdraw our forc from iraq without concern for condit on the ground and the advic of command in the field __PUNCT__
american ought to be concern about the judgment of a presidenti candid who sai he readi to talk __PUNCT__ in person and without condit __PUNCT__ with tyrant from havana to pyongyang __PUNCT__ but hasn't travel to iraq to meet with gener petraeu __PUNCT__ and see for himself the progress he threaten to revers __PUNCT__
i know american ar tire of thi war __PUNCT__
i don't oppos a reckless withdraw from iraq becaus i indiffer to the suffer war inflict on too mani american famili __PUNCT__
i hate war __PUNCT__
and i know veri person how terribl it cost ar __PUNCT__
but i know __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ that the cours senat obama advoc could draw us into a wider war with even greater sacrific __PUNCT__ put peac further out of reach __PUNCT__ and american back in harm wai __PUNCT__
i take america econom secur as serious as i do her physic secur __PUNCT__
for eight year the feder govern ha been on a spend spree that ad trillion to the nation debt __PUNCT__
it spend more and more of your monei on program that have fail again and again to keep up with the chang confront american famili __PUNCT__
extravag spend on thing that ar not the busi of govern indebt us to other nation __PUNCT__ fuel inflat __PUNCT__ rais interest rate __PUNCT__ and encourag irrespons __PUNCT__
i have oppos wast spend by both parti and the bush administr __PUNCT__
senat obama ha support it and propos more of hi own __PUNCT__
i want to freez discretionari spend until we have complet top to bottom review of all feder program to weed out fail on __PUNCT__
senat obama oppos that reform __PUNCT__
i oppos subsidi that favor big busi over small farmer and tariff on import product that have greatli increas the cost of food __PUNCT__
senat obama support these billion of dollar in corpor subsidi and the tariff that have led to rise groceri bill for american famili __PUNCT__
that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
no problem is more urgent todai than america depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
it threaten our secur __PUNCT__ our economi and our environ __PUNCT__
the next presid must be will to break complet with the energi polici not just of the bush administr __PUNCT__ but the administr that preced hi __PUNCT__ and lead a great nation campaign to put us on a cours to energi independ __PUNCT__
we must unleash the creativ and geniu of american __PUNCT__ and encourag industri to pursu altern __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ pollut and renew energi sourc __PUNCT__ where demand will never exce suppli __PUNCT__
senat obama vote for the same polici that creat the problem __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ he vote for the energi bill promot by presid bush and vice presid chenei __PUNCT__ which gave even more break to the oil industri __PUNCT__
i oppos it becaus i know we won't achiev energi independ by repeat the mistak of the last half centuri __PUNCT__
that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
with forward think democrat and republican __PUNCT__ i propos a climat chang polici that would greatli reduc our depend on oil __PUNCT__
our approach wa oppos by presid bush __PUNCT__ and by lead democrat __PUNCT__ and it wa defeat by opposit from special interest that favor republican and those that favor democrat __PUNCT__
senat obama might critic special interest that give more monei to republican __PUNCT__
but you won't often see him take on those that favor him __PUNCT__
if america is go to achiev energi independ __PUNCT__ we need a presid with a record of put the nation interest befor the special interest of either parti __PUNCT__
i have that record __PUNCT__
senat obama doe not __PUNCT__
senat obama propos to keep spend monei on program that make our problem wors and creat new on that ar model on big govern program that creat much of the fiscal mess we ar in __PUNCT__
he plan to pai for these increas by rais tax on senior __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ small busi owner and everi american with even a modest invest in the market __PUNCT__
he doesn't trust us to make decis for ourselv and want the govern to make them for us __PUNCT__
and that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
senat obama think we can improv health care by drive american into a new system of govern order __PUNCT__ regul and mandat __PUNCT__
i believ we can make health care more avail __PUNCT__ afford and respons to patient by break from inflationari practic __PUNCT__ insur regul __PUNCT__ and tax polici that were design gener ago __PUNCT__ and by give famili more choic over their care __PUNCT__
hi plan repres the old wai of govern __PUNCT__
mine trust in the common sens of the american peopl __PUNCT__
senat obama pretend we can address the loss of manufactur job by repeal trade agreement and refus to sign new on __PUNCT__ that we can build a stronger economi by limit access to our market and give up access to foreign market __PUNCT__
the global economi exist and is not go awai __PUNCT__
we either compet in it or we lose more job __PUNCT__ more busi __PUNCT__ more dream __PUNCT__
we lose the futur __PUNCT__
he an intellig man __PUNCT__ and he must know how foolish it is to think american can remain prosper without open new market to our good and servic __PUNCT__
but he feel he must defer to the special interest that support him __PUNCT__
that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
lower trade barrier to american good and servic creat more and better job __PUNCT__ keep inflat under control __PUNCT__ keep interest rate low __PUNCT__ and make more good afford to more american __PUNCT__
we won't compet successfulli by us old technolog to produc old good __PUNCT__
we succe by know what to produc and invent new technolog to produc it __PUNCT__
we ar not peopl who believ onli in the surviv of the fittest __PUNCT__
work in america is more than a paycheck __PUNCT__ it a sourc of pride __PUNCT__ self __PUNCT__ relianc and ident __PUNCT__
but make empti promis to bring back lost job give noth to the unemploi worker except fals hope __PUNCT__
that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
reform from top to bottom unemploy insur and retrain program that were design for the 1950 __PUNCT__ make us of our commun colleg to train peopl for new opportun will help worker who lost a job that won't come back __PUNCT__ find a job that won't go awai __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ we not a countri that would rather go back than forward __PUNCT__
we the world leader __PUNCT__ and leader don't hide from histori __PUNCT__
thei make histori __PUNCT__
but if we go to lead __PUNCT__ we have to reform a govern that ha lost it abil to help us do so __PUNCT__
the solut to our problem isn't to reach back to the 1960 and 70 for answer __PUNCT__
in just a few year in offic __PUNCT__ senat obama ha accumul the most liber vote record in the senat __PUNCT__
but the old __PUNCT__ tire __PUNCT__ big govern polici he seek to dust off and call new won't work in a world that ha chang dramat sinc thei were last tri and fail __PUNCT__
that not chang we can believ in __PUNCT__
the sweep reform of govern we need won't occur unless we chang the polit habit of washington that have lock us in an endless cycl of bicker and stalem __PUNCT__
washington is consum by a hyper __PUNCT__ partisanship that treat everi seriou issu as an opportun to trade insult __PUNCT__ impugn each other motiv __PUNCT__ and fight about the next elect __PUNCT__
thi is the game washington plai __PUNCT__
both parti plai it __PUNCT__ as do the special interest that support each side __PUNCT__
the american peopl know it not on the level __PUNCT__
for all the problem we face __PUNCT__ what frustrat them most about washington is thei don't think we capabl of serv the public interest befor our person ambit __PUNCT__ that we fight for ourselv and not for them __PUNCT__
thei ar sick of the polit of selfish __PUNCT__ stalem and delai __PUNCT__ and thei have everi right to be __PUNCT__
we have to chang not onli govern polici that have fail them __PUNCT__ but the polit cultur that produc them __PUNCT__
both senat obama and i promis we will end washington stagnant __PUNCT__ unproduct partisanship __PUNCT__
but on of us ha a record of work to do that and on of us doesn't __PUNCT__
american have seen me put asid partisan and person interest to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
thei haven't seen senat obama do the same __PUNCT__
for all hi fine word and all hi promis __PUNCT__ he ha never taken the hard but right cours of risk hi own interest for your __PUNCT__ of stand against the partisan rancor on hi side to stand up for our countri __PUNCT__
he is an impress man __PUNCT__ who make a great first impress __PUNCT__
but he hasn't been will to make the tough call __PUNCT__ to challeng hi parti __PUNCT__ to risk critic from hi support to bring real chang to washington __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__
when member of my parti refus to compromis not on principl but for partisanship __PUNCT__ i have sought to do so __PUNCT__
when i fought corrupt it didn't matter to me if the culprit were democrat or republican __PUNCT__
i expos it and let the chip fall where thei mai __PUNCT__
when i work on campaign financ and ethic reform __PUNCT__ i did so with democrat and republican __PUNCT__ even though we were critic by other member of our parti __PUNCT__ who prefer to keep thing as thei were __PUNCT__
i have never refus to work with democrat simpli for the sake of partisanship __PUNCT__
i alwai known we belong to differ parti __PUNCT__ not differ countri __PUNCT__
we ar american befor we ar anyth els __PUNCT__
i don't seek the presid on the presumpt i bless with such person great that histori ha anoint me to save my countri in it hour of need __PUNCT__
i seek the offic with the humil of a man who cannot forget my countri save me __PUNCT__
i reach out my hand to anyon __PUNCT__ republican or democrat __PUNCT__ who will help me chang what need to be chang __PUNCT__ fix what need to be fix __PUNCT__ and give thi countri a govern as capabl and good as the peopl it is suppos to serv __PUNCT__
there is a time to campaign __PUNCT__ and a time to govern __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ the era of the perman campaign of the last sixteen year will end __PUNCT__
the era of reform and problem solv will begin __PUNCT__
from my first dai in offic __PUNCT__ i work with anyon to make america safe __PUNCT__ prosper and proud __PUNCT__
and i won't care who get the credit as long as america get the benefit __PUNCT__
i have seen republican and democrat achiev great thing togeth __PUNCT__
when the stake were high and it matter most __PUNCT__ i seen them work togeth in common purpos __PUNCT__ as we did in the week after __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thi kind of cooper ha made all the differ at crucial turn in our histori __PUNCT__
it ha given us hope in difficult time __PUNCT__
it ha move america forward __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is the kind of chang we need right now __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
