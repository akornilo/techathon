thank you for the honor of appear with you here todai __PUNCT__
the irish __PUNCT__ american presidenti forum ha been held sinc __NUM__ and sinc it incept there ha been a lack of republican __PUNCT__
and while my affect for democrat and independ is deep and wide __PUNCT__ i am proud to be the first republican to appear befor the forum __PUNCT__
you ar veri kind to invit someon with a name like mccain __PUNCT__ a scot __PUNCT__ irish descend whose famili came to the new world some gener ago __PUNCT__
i hope you won't hold it against us __PUNCT__ i do try to get back to the island as often as possibl __PUNCT__
i like to talk about some issu that ar of particular concern to irish __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__ but befor i do __PUNCT__ i like to take a coupl minut to talk about an issu that is concern to us all __PUNCT__ and that is the econom crisi that we have all been follow sinc last week __PUNCT__
on fridai __PUNCT__ i laid out my plan for address thi crisi __PUNCT__
at it heart __PUNCT__ my plan is about keep peopl in their home and safeguard the life save of all american by protect our financi system and capit market __PUNCT__
these ar my prioriti __PUNCT__
senat obama ha declin to put forth a plan of hi own __PUNCT__
at a time of crisi __PUNCT__ when leadership is need __PUNCT__ senat obama ha simpli not provid it __PUNCT__
and the truth is that we don't have time to wait for senat obama input for our nation to act __PUNCT__
i think it is clear that congress must act and must act quickli __PUNCT__
i laid out my plan and my prioriti last fridai __PUNCT__
i spoke to secretari paulson over the weekend __PUNCT__ and i been look at the plan the administr ha put forth __PUNCT__
i urg congress to studi thi propos carefulli as thei consid the remedi for thi crisi __PUNCT__
as for me __PUNCT__ i am greatli concern that the plan give a singl individu the unpreced power to spend __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ trillion __PUNCT__ dollar without ani meaning account __PUNCT__
never befor in the histori of our nation ha so much power and monei been concentr in the hand of on person __PUNCT__
thi arrang make me deepli uncomfort __PUNCT__
when we ar talk about a trillion dollar of taxpay monei __PUNCT__ trust me __PUNCT__ just isn't good enough __PUNCT__
we will not solv a problem caus by poor oversight with a plan that ha no oversight __PUNCT__
part of the reason we ar face thi crisi is an antiqu regulatori system of uncoordin agenc that haven't been do the job __PUNCT__
i believ we need a high level oversight board to impos account and establish concret criteria for who get help and who doe not __PUNCT__
thei must ensur that throughout thi crisi __PUNCT__ the govern is a care steward of the taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
the oversight board should be bipartisan and have qualifi citizen who have no agenda but the protect of taxpay and the financi market __PUNCT__
peopl like __PUNCT__ warren buffet __PUNCT__ who support my oppon __PUNCT__ governor romnei __PUNCT__ who support me __PUNCT__ or mayor bloomberg __PUNCT__ an independ __PUNCT__
the firm we help need account too __PUNCT__
we cannot have taxpay foot the bill for bloat golden parachut like we see in the lehman brother bankruptci __PUNCT__ where the top execut ar ask for __MONEY__ billion in bonus after thei ran the compani into the ground __PUNCT__
the senior execut of ani firm that is bail out by treasuri should not be make more than the highest paid govern offici __PUNCT__
i would also urg transpar throughout thi process __PUNCT__
the american peopl have the right to know which firm will be help __PUNCT__ what that select will be base on and how much that help will cost __PUNCT__
the detail of the process and the transact itself should all be made avail onlin for public scrutini __PUNCT__
as congress examin thi packag __PUNCT__ i would encourag all member to set asid the pressur of washington and wall street __PUNCT__
as we determin what to do __PUNCT__ we need to put our countri first and focu on what is best for main street __PUNCT__
we must help keep peopl in their home __PUNCT__
we must protect american save __PUNCT__
and we must keep student with loan in school __PUNCT__
what we need in ani reform is account for wall street __PUNCT__ account for govern __PUNCT__ and a commit to protect peopl __PUNCT__ home and life save and restor our financi market __PUNCT__
time ar tough for our economi __PUNCT__ and i expect more tough econom new befor the elect __PUNCT__
my commit to the american peopl is to fix the wall street mess __PUNCT__ reform washington __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ enact a pro __PUNCT__ growth agenda to creat job for american and get thi countri back on track __PUNCT__
there ar a coupl of thing that we could learn from the irish in that regard __PUNCT__
a commit to low busi tax and free trade ha made it the home of choic for busi from around europ and the world __PUNCT__ and creat a sourc of well __PUNCT__ paid job for talent peopl __PUNCT__
i believ that both those polici ar import exampl __PUNCT__ and if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ my agenda will includ increas trade between the unit state and ireland __PUNCT__ along with successfulli complet recent discuss on visa for the benefit of all our citizen __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ let me sai that if you look around the world todai __PUNCT__ it is easi to see problem and challeng almost everywher __PUNCT__
our countri is in the midst of two war __PUNCT__ our economi is in turmoil __PUNCT__ a number of region around the globe ar unstabl or unfriendli __PUNCT__
but event in other place ar inspir __PUNCT__ and that is certainli true of northern ireland __PUNCT__
mani of those who saw decad of fight in that proud and beauti land thought that the dai might never come when talk took the place of tank __PUNCT__ and ballot the place of bullet __PUNCT__
but that dai ha dawn in northern ireland and we ar all __PUNCT__ irish and american alik __PUNCT__ better off for it __PUNCT__
when in mai of last year the world saw imag of a devolv govern in belfast __PUNCT__ restor under the stewardship of ian paislei and martin mcguin __PUNCT__ it captur a polit courag the previou gener could have scarc imagin __PUNCT__
there remain hard work ahead __PUNCT__
it is an honor for the unit state to be trust as an honest broker by both parti to the good fridai agreement __PUNCT__ and if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i will continu america leadership role __PUNCT__
i am commit __PUNCT__ as i know the american peopl ar commit __PUNCT__ to further the bond of cooper that have been forg in northern ireland peac process __PUNCT__
as a demonstr of that commit __PUNCT__ i will continu the practic __PUNCT__ begun by presid clinton __PUNCT__ of appoint a u. __PUNCT__ special envoi for northern ireland __PUNCT__
i know senat obama ha question whether that appoint is need __PUNCT__
i would urg him to reconsid __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i assur you that there will be no weaken in america commit to peac in northern ireland __PUNCT__
i maintain the special u. __PUNCT__ envoi for northern ireland __PUNCT__ and i will welcom peacemak to the white hous __PUNCT__
the peopl of northern ireland want the same thing that we american want __PUNCT__ the opportun to build a better life for themselv and their children __PUNCT__
it is up to leader of both countri to creat the condit that will let them do so __PUNCT__
