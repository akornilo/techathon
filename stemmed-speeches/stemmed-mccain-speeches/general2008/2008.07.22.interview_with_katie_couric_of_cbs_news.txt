couric __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ prime minist maliki and sen __PUNCT__ obama seem to be on the same page when it come to a timet for the withdraw of u. __PUNCT__ troop by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
ar you feel like the odd man out here __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ prime minist maliki __PUNCT__ gener petraeu __PUNCT__ admir mullen and the other leader in iraq have all agre that it condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama said the surg would fail __PUNCT__
he said that it couldn't succe __PUNCT__
he wa wrong __PUNCT__
he said he still doesn't agre that surg ha succeed now that everybodi know that it ha succeed __PUNCT__
i said at the time that i support the surg __PUNCT__
i would much rather lose a campaign than lose a war __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama ha indic that by hi failur to acknowledg the success of the surg __PUNCT__ that he would rather lose a war than lose a campaign __PUNCT__
i know what thi conflict is all about __PUNCT__
i will bring our troop home __PUNCT__
i will bring them home in victori __PUNCT__
i will not do what the chairman of the joint chief of staff said would be veri danger __PUNCT__
we will have a stabl iraq that we won't have to return to becaus we have succeed in the strategi and we will come home with victori and honor and not in defeat __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama ha said that if the surg fail that he might have to send troop back __PUNCT__
after thi surg ha succeed and we won a victori __PUNCT__ we never have to send american back __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ why do you think prime minist maliki publicli support and endors the concept of a timet __PUNCT__ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ month timet __PUNCT__ and isn't that on of the main object of the oper __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ to get the iraqi militari to stand up so u. __PUNCT__ forc can __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ stand down __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well that what thei been do and we succeed __PUNCT__
and the fact is that prime minster maliki __PUNCT__
alwai said it would be condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__
and so ha all of our leader __PUNCT__ and so ha gener petraeu __PUNCT__ who ha had enorm success __PUNCT__
if sen __PUNCT__ obama had had hi wai __PUNCT__ we of never had the surg __PUNCT__
and we of been out of there last march __PUNCT__
probabl have to come back becaus of chao in the region __PUNCT__
increas iranian influenc __PUNCT__
so the fact is that we have succeed __PUNCT__
we ar win __PUNCT__
thei come home with honor __PUNCT__
and it won't be just at a set timet __PUNCT__
it be condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ which all of us ar in agreement __PUNCT__
we includ our militari leader __PUNCT__
includ on of the great gener in histori __PUNCT__ gener petraeu __PUNCT__ who devic hi strategi wa succeed when __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ most peopl __PUNCT__ and those who thought __PUNCT__ includ polit pundit __PUNCT__ said we had lost the war __PUNCT__ includ harri reid __PUNCT__ includ __URL__
so we succeed __PUNCT__
and we will come home in victori __PUNCT__
and it be base on condit __PUNCT__
but al qaeda is not defeat __PUNCT__
thei on the run __PUNCT__ but thei not defeat __PUNCT__
so we have to be prepar to continu to do what necessari to succe __PUNCT__
but we have in order to win the war __PUNCT__
but we have succeed in the strategi __PUNCT__
there no doubt about it __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama sai __PUNCT__ while the increas number of u. __PUNCT__ troop contribut to increas secur in iraq __PUNCT__ he also credit the sunni awaken and the shiit govern go after militia __PUNCT__
and sai that there might have been improv secur even without the surg __PUNCT__
what your respons to that __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't know how you respond to someth that is such a fals depict of what actual happen __PUNCT__
colonel mcfarlan __PUNCT__ phonet __PUNCT__ wa contact by on of the major sunni sheik __PUNCT__
becaus of the surg we were abl to go out and protect that sheik and other __PUNCT__
and it began the anbar awaken __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ that just a matter of histori __PUNCT__
thank to gener petraeu __PUNCT__ our leadership __PUNCT__ and the sacrific of brave young american __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ to deni that their sacrific didn't make possibl the success of the surg in iraq __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ doe a great disservic to young men and women who ar serv and have sacrif __PUNCT__
thei were out there __PUNCT__
thei were protect these sheik __PUNCT__
we had the anbar awaken __PUNCT__
we now have a govern that effect __PUNCT__
we have a legal system that work __PUNCT__ although poorli __PUNCT__
and we have progress on all front __PUNCT__ includ an incred measur of secur for the peopl of iraq __PUNCT__
there will still be attack __PUNCT__
al qaeda not defeat __PUNCT__
but the progress ha been immens __PUNCT__
and to not recogn that __PUNCT__ and why it happen __PUNCT__ and how it happen __PUNCT__ i think is realli quit a commentari __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ a commentari on what __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ that sen __PUNCT__ obama doe not understand the challeng we face __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ not understand the need for the surg __PUNCT__
and the fact that he did not understand that __PUNCT__ and still deni that it ha succeed __PUNCT__ i think the american peopl will make their judgment __PUNCT__
and i think that thei will agre with me __PUNCT__ that at enorm sacrific __PUNCT__ after four year __PUNCT__ nearli four year of fail strategi __PUNCT__ we have succeed __PUNCT__
and our troop will come home with honor __PUNCT__
and we won't be defeat __PUNCT__
and there won't be chao in the region __PUNCT__
there won't be increas iranian influenc in the region __PUNCT__
and it will have a bear on what happen in afghanistan __PUNCT__ as well as the entir region of the world __PUNCT__
and i proud of what thei done __PUNCT__
and to deni their success __PUNCT__ i think is a fundament misunderstand of what happen __PUNCT__
the american peopl will make a judgment __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama also told me __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ that the monei spent on those addit troop __PUNCT__ on the surg __PUNCT__ might have been more effect had it gone to afghanistan or even to a better energi polici in the unit state __PUNCT__
what your respons __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ the fact is we had four year of fail polici __PUNCT__
we were lose __PUNCT__
we were lose the war in iraq __PUNCT__
the consequ of failur and defeat of the unit state of america in the first major conflict sinc 9/11 would have had devast impact throughout the region and the world __PUNCT__
thank to a great gener __PUNCT__ thank to a lot of courag and braveri on the part of american men and women in the militari __PUNCT__ we succeed __PUNCT__
and we ar on the path to an honor withdraw and __PUNCT__
victori __PUNCT__
not have to return __PUNCT__ as sen __PUNCT__ obama said we might have to __PUNCT__ if hi strategi of straight date for withdraw didn't succe __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ of cours it been enorm sacrific __PUNCT__
and american ar all sadden by it __PUNCT__
but the consequ of failur would have been devast __PUNCT__
and that would have been the result if we had done what sen __PUNCT__ obama want to do __PUNCT__
which would have meant our troop were out by last march __PUNCT__ much less anytim soon __PUNCT__ accord to an arbitrari date __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ the futur is bright for the peopl of iraq __PUNCT__
the futur is bright for stabil in the region __PUNCT__ for strengthen our allianc and succeed in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and it gonna be long and hard and tough struggl __PUNCT__
if we had done what sen __PUNCT__ obama had want __PUNCT__ we would have been defeat __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we have the chanc and opportun for a veri bright futur __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama describ afghanistan as the central front on the war on terror __PUNCT__
that is where __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ 9/11 wa plot __PUNCT__
and now the border between afghanistan and pakistan seem to be a hot bed of al qaeda activ __PUNCT__
why do you believ iraq is the central front in the war on terror __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ on reason is becaus that what osama bin laden said that it wa __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ go to the countri of the two river __PUNCT__
that what gener petraeu sai __PUNCT__ who i think is extrem knowledg __PUNCT__
that it is the central battleground __PUNCT__
and afghanistan is veri tough __PUNCT__
and there a number of great challeng there __PUNCT__
and we have to emploi the same strategi there that succeed in iraq __PUNCT__
and we can succe there __PUNCT__
we got the problem on the pakistan __PUNCT__ afghan border __PUNCT__
we got the poppi problem __PUNCT__
we got a weak govern there in kabul __PUNCT__
but we can and will succe there __PUNCT__
and if we hadn't succeed in iraq __PUNCT__ then the complic would have been incred more sever __PUNCT__
and the chanc of succeed in afghanistan would have been greatli diminish __PUNCT__
now that we succeed in iraq __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ we will be free up troop to go to afghanistan __PUNCT__
and we will urg our nato alli to send more troop and be more involv as well __PUNCT__
we can succe __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ do you agre with sen __PUNCT__ obama content that up to three addit brigad should be deploi to afghanistan __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i said that for a long time __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you see __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama doesn't understand it not just troop __PUNCT__
it an overal strategi __PUNCT__
the kind that we emploi in iraq __PUNCT__ which he said couldn't succe __PUNCT__ and wouldn't succe __PUNCT__ and still doesn't acknowledg as have succeed incred __PUNCT__
that the same strategi that will work in afghanistan __PUNCT__
so it not just troop __PUNCT__ it hold and build __PUNCT__
it work and build up the afghan armi __PUNCT__
it combat the poppi crop __PUNCT__
it a stronger govern of afghanistan __PUNCT__
it a resettl and address the issu over the border area between pakistan and afghanistan __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ it an overal strategi __PUNCT__
it not just two or three brigad __PUNCT__
it is also increas engag on the part of our nato alli __PUNCT__
but i guarante you __PUNCT__ if we had fail in iraq __PUNCT__ and been defeat in iraq __PUNCT__ our challeng in afghanistan would have been dramat complic and wors __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ you sound veri frustrat with sen __PUNCT__ obama perspect __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i not at all __PUNCT__
i respect sen __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__
i admir hi success __PUNCT__
he won a veri tough primari campaign __PUNCT__
i respect him __PUNCT__
i look forward to debat these issu __PUNCT__
he just ha been wrong and he is wrong __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ therefor __PUNCT__ i strongli disagre __PUNCT__
and i think the american peopl will make a judgment about who wa right __PUNCT__
and so i admir and respect sen __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__
i wish he would have engag in town hall meet with me __PUNCT__ as i ask him to do __PUNCT__
so that we could talk about thi and other issu __PUNCT__ includ the economi __PUNCT__ which is the overrid issu to american todai __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ you have said __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ i know how to win war __PUNCT__
which war __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ ar you refer to __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ bosnia __PUNCT__
kosovo __PUNCT__
first gulf war __PUNCT__
the conflict in iraq __PUNCT__
to name a few __PUNCT__
i been engag in everi singl on of them __PUNCT__ and in a decis make process as on of the senior member of the arm servic committe __PUNCT__
and engag in the debat on the floor of the unit state senat __PUNCT__
and involv in the arm servic committe __PUNCT__
i know those war __PUNCT__
i know conflict __PUNCT__
and i hate war __PUNCT__
no on hate war more than the veteran who feel most plainli the loss of a veteran __PUNCT__
and i know how to win war __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ what doe victori in iraq mean to you __PUNCT__ and how long ar you will to engag u. __PUNCT__ troop to achiev it __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ we have succeed in iraq __PUNCT__
we ar win __PUNCT__
we will be make addit withdraw as everybodi acknowledg __PUNCT__
we mai have an advisori capac as even sen __PUNCT__ obama agre __PUNCT__
and we mai have secur arrang that ar in the interest of both countri __PUNCT__
but the fact is victori is be achiev now __PUNCT__
a stabl societi __PUNCT__
secur environ __PUNCT__
function govern __PUNCT__
function legal system __PUNCT__
all of the trap of a nation where peopl can feel secur in their futur in a free and independ nation __PUNCT__
and that what we succeed in the strategi which will then mean we ar win the war and bring our troop home __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ what is your biggest fear about bring troop home too soon __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ that we lose the fragil success that we have achiev __PUNCT__
al qaeda is not defeat __PUNCT__
thei on the run __PUNCT__ but thei not defeat __PUNCT__
so my greatest concern is that we announc a date for withdraw __PUNCT__ which would have had devast consequ if we had done it when sen __PUNCT__ obama want it done __PUNCT__
and we lose all the hard won gain that we achiev at the great sacrific of american blood and treasur __PUNCT__
i don't want that revers __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama had said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if thing don't go right __PUNCT__ he prepar to send american troop back __PUNCT__
i prepar to leav when we have victori __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ we will never have to send american troop back __PUNCT__
