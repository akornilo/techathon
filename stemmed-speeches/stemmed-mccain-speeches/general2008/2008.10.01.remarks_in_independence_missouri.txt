thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
i appreci the hospit of the harri truman librari institut __PUNCT__
i honor to be here in the town that sent harri truman to washington __PUNCT__ and the town that welcom him back when hi work wa done __PUNCT__
presid truman wa a student of histori __PUNCT__ and he knew how suddenli a crisi could come about __PUNCT__
and while so mani thing have chang in the __NUM__ year sinc hi pass __PUNCT__ harri truman would sure recogn the sourc of the financi crisi that now threaten the livelihood of million and the futur of the entir american economi __PUNCT__
onli the vast sum of monei would surpris him __PUNCT__
but the cost of unbridl greed on wall street __PUNCT__ the foolish of politician who fed the problem __PUNCT__ and the reckless of politician who fail to meet the crisi __PUNCT__ all of these would have a familiar feel to the man from independ __PUNCT__
we ar squar in the greatest financi crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__
and i am pleas to report that todai __PUNCT__ i will be return to the floor of the senat to vote on a bill that mark a decis step in the right direct __PUNCT__
the origin propos wa flaw __PUNCT__
i urg addit of taxpay protect __PUNCT__ stronger oversight __PUNCT__ limit on execut compens and more protect for peopl bank account __PUNCT__
i am pleas that these ar be ad to improv the origin bill __PUNCT__
it took congress a while __PUNCT__ and there were cost to these delai __PUNCT__
but thei have awaken to the danger __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ with the uniti that thi crisi demand __PUNCT__ congress will onc again work to restor confid and stabil to the american economi __PUNCT__
there will be a time to fix the blame for all that ha happen __PUNCT__ especi in the case of fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and the abus and polit deal __PUNCT__ make that corrupt those institut __PUNCT__
but our duti right now is to fix the problem __PUNCT__ and that is the busi that will shortli take me back to washington __PUNCT__
follow __DATE__ __PUNCT__ our nation leader came togeth at a time of crisi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ with thi measur __PUNCT__ we have anoth chanc to come togeth to prove that washington is onc again capabl of lead thi countri __PUNCT__
if the financi rescu bill fail in congress yet again __PUNCT__ the present crisi will turn into a disast __PUNCT__
as credit disappear __PUNCT__ student will no longer be abl to get loan for colleg __PUNCT__ and famili look for a new home will be unabl to get a loan __PUNCT__
new car sale will come to a halt __PUNCT__
busi will have difficulti secur credit for oper and mai be unabl to pai employe __PUNCT__
if we fail to act __PUNCT__ the gear of our economi will grind to a halt __PUNCT__
thi is a moment of great test __PUNCT__
at such moment __PUNCT__ there ar those on both side of thi debat who will act on principl __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ there ar alwai some who think first of their own interest __PUNCT__ who calcul their own advantag instead of rush to the aid of their countri __PUNCT__
but in the case of thi bill __PUNCT__ i am confid there ar enough peopl of good will in both parti to help see america through thi crisi __PUNCT__
and when the last vote is cast __PUNCT__ we can be grate to all of them __PUNCT__ democrat and republican alik __PUNCT__ for help to solv the crisi instead of mere exploit it __PUNCT__
crise often have a wai of reveal our better selv __PUNCT__ of show what we ar made of __PUNCT__ and how much we can achiev when we ar put to the test __PUNCT__
thi is true as well of the grave challeng we face in washington __PUNCT__
yet it should not requir extrem emerg __PUNCT__ when the futur of our entir economi is on the line __PUNCT__ to bring out the best in us __PUNCT__ or to bring us togeth in servic to the common good __PUNCT__
we ar suppos to do that even in the calmest of time __PUNCT__
and if we work togeth more often in that spirit __PUNCT__ perhap there would be fewer crise __PUNCT__ close __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ and near __PUNCT__ disast confront our nation __PUNCT__
just consid the dai __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ dai routin of congress __PUNCT__ even as the __NUM__ congress end __PUNCT__ there remain a long list of challeng unmet __PUNCT__

from agricultur to the labor depart to transport __PUNCT__ the major of appropri bill have not pass __PUNCT__
even fund for the oper of the legisl branch itself ha not pass __PUNCT__
congress can't even find agreement on the yearli bill to pai for the congress itself __PUNCT__
and while these routin fund issu ar address at the last minut behind close door __PUNCT__ the big challeng face our countri continu to languish __PUNCT__
we still have made no progress to resolv our energi crisi __PUNCT__
while we seek solut to the econom crisi we face todai __PUNCT__ washington ha been ineffect in address the hous crisi that start it __PUNCT__
and in the face of mount job loss __PUNCT__ we still have not taken action to put our economi back on track with polici that would encourag job creation __PUNCT__ or with updat to an unemploy system and job train program that were creat for the 1950 __PUNCT__
our govern is on the wrong track __PUNCT__ our economi is struggl __PUNCT__ and i expect we will receiv more bad new with fridai unemploy report __PUNCT__
it is a time for leadership and a plan to creat job and get our countri on the right track __PUNCT__

and we will protect the right of worker to decid for themselv __PUNCT__ by democrat vote __PUNCT__ whether to union __PUNCT__

reduc govern spend and get rid of fail program will let you keep more of your own monei to save __PUNCT__ spend and invest as you see fit __PUNCT__
open new market for our good and prepar worker to compet in the world economi is essenti to our futur prosper __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will also set thi countri on the straightest __PUNCT__ swiftest path to energi independ __PUNCT__
as a nation __PUNCT__ we will embark on the most ambiti nation project in decad __PUNCT__
we ar go to stop send __MONEY__ billion a year to countri that don't like us veri much __PUNCT__

on my watch __PUNCT__ the rule will be enforc __PUNCT__ and violat will be prosecut __PUNCT__
and there will be new rule to shrink __PUNCT__ sell __PUNCT__ and clean hous at fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__
we must also realiz that thi rescu plan ha seriou implic for futur spend __PUNCT__
we cannot dedic more than a trillion dollar to rescu fail institut __PUNCT__ and then go right back to busi as usual in washington __PUNCT__ as if there were no end to the resourc of govern or to the patienc of taxpay __PUNCT__
