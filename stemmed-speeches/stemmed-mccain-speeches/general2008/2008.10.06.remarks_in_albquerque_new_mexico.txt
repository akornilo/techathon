you know my stori and my convict __PUNCT__
and though familiar in polit can be both help to a candid __PUNCT__ or not so help __PUNCT__ it doe at least fill out the pictur and answer the essenti question __PUNCT__

thi is the agenda i have set befor my fellow citizen __PUNCT__
and the same standard of clariti and candor must now be appli to my oppon __PUNCT__
even at thi late hour in the campaign __PUNCT__ there ar essenti thing we don't know about senat obama or the record that he bring to thi campaign __PUNCT__
we have all heard what he ha said __PUNCT__ but it is less clear what he ha done or what he will do __PUNCT__
what senat obama sai todai and what he ha done in the past ar often two differ thing __PUNCT__
he ha often chang hi posit in thi campaign __PUNCT__ and the best wai to determin where he would realli take thi countri is to examin where he ha tri to take it in the past __PUNCT__
my oppon ha invit seriou question by announc a few week ago that he would quot __PUNCT__ take off the glove __PUNCT__
sinc then __PUNCT__ whenev i have question hi polici or hi record __PUNCT__ he ha call me a liar __PUNCT__
rather than answer hi critic __PUNCT__ senat obama will try to distract you from notic that he never answer the seriou and legitim question he ha been ask __PUNCT__
but let me repli in the plainest term i know __PUNCT__
i don't need lesson about tell the truth to american peopl __PUNCT__
and were i ever to need ani improv in that regard __PUNCT__ i probabl wouldn't seek advic from a chicago politician __PUNCT__
my oppon touchi everi time he is question about hi record should make us onli more concern __PUNCT__
for a gui who alreadi author two memoir __PUNCT__ he not exactli an open book __PUNCT__
it as if somehow the usual rule don't appli __PUNCT__ and where other candid have to explain themselv and their record __PUNCT__ senat obama seem to think he is abov all that __PUNCT__
whatev the question __PUNCT__ whatev the issu __PUNCT__ there alwai a back stori with senat obama __PUNCT__
all peopl want to know is __PUNCT__ what ha thi man ever actual accomplish in govern __PUNCT__ what doe he plan for america __PUNCT__ in short __PUNCT__ who is the real barack obama __PUNCT__ but ask such question and all you get in respons is anoth barrag of angri insult __PUNCT__
our current econom crisi is a good case in point __PUNCT__
what wa hi actual record in the year befor the great econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ thi crisi start in our hous market in the form of subprim loan that were push on peopl who could not afford them __PUNCT__
bad mortgag were be back by fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and it wa onli a matter of time befor a contagion of unsustain debt began to spread __PUNCT__
thi corrupt wa encourag by democrat in congress __PUNCT__ and abet by senat obama __PUNCT__
senat obama ha accus me of oppos regul to avert thi crisi __PUNCT__
i guess he believ if a lie is big enough and repeat often enough it will be believ __PUNCT__
but the truth is i wa the on who call at the time for tighter restrict on fanni mae and freddi mac that could have help prevent thi crisi from happen in the first place __PUNCT__
senat obama wa silent on the regul of fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and hi democrat alli in congress oppos everi effort to rein them in __PUNCT__
as recent as __DATE__ of last year he said that subprim loan had been __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ a good idea __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ good idea __PUNCT__ ha now plung thi countri into the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
to hear him talk now __PUNCT__ you think he alwai oppos the danger practic at these institut __PUNCT__
but there is absolut noth in hi record to suggest he did __PUNCT__
he wa sure familiar with the peopl who were creat thi problem __PUNCT__
the execut of fanni mae and freddi mac have advis him __PUNCT__ and he ha taken their monei for hi campaign __PUNCT__
he ha receiv more monei from fanni mae and freddi mac than ani other senat in histori __PUNCT__ with the except of the chairman of the committe overse them __PUNCT__
did he ever talk to the execut at fanni and freddi about these reckless loan __PUNCT__ did he ever discuss with them the stronger oversight i propos __PUNCT__ if senat obama is such a champion of financi regul __PUNCT__ why didn't he support these regul that could have prevent thi crisi in the first place __PUNCT__ he won't tell you __PUNCT__ but you deserv an answer __PUNCT__
even after he refus to lift a finger to prevent thi crisi __PUNCT__ when the crisi hit __PUNCT__ he wa miss in action __PUNCT__
he didn't start make call to round up vote until after the rescu bill fail in the hous and the market crash __PUNCT__
we continu to see the price of delai todai as the market continu to fall __PUNCT__
todai the dow ha fallen below __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ member of hi own parti said thei felt no pressur to vote for the bill __PUNCT__
why didn't senat obama work to pass thi bill from the start __PUNCT__ why did he let it fail and drag out thi crisi for a full week befor do a thing to help pass it __PUNCT__ again on tax __PUNCT__ we see a differ between what senat obama sai todai __PUNCT__ what he said yesterdai and what he ha actual done __PUNCT__
over the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__ he ha had mani differ plan to rais your tax __PUNCT__
dure the democrat primari __PUNCT__ he promis to doubl tax on everi american with a dividend or an invest __PUNCT__
he promis to rais payrol tax __PUNCT__
he promis higher tax on electr __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat obama claim he will give __NUM__ percent of american tax relief __PUNCT__
he actual promis the same thing when he wa run for senat in illinoi __PUNCT__ but onc elect he never introduc legisl to do so __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he vote for the democrat budget resolut that promis to rais tax on peopl make just __NUM__ dollar a year __PUNCT__
at the time __PUNCT__ he even said hi vote wa intend to get __PUNCT__ our nation prioriti back on track __PUNCT__
if he such a defend of the middl class __PUNCT__ why did he vote to rais their tax __PUNCT__ whatev ha ppene to the tax relief he promis them when he wa a candid for the senat __PUNCT__ and why should middl class american trust him to keep promis he ha alreadi broken __PUNCT__ senat obama and i both have differ with how presid bush ha handl the economi __PUNCT__
but he think tax ar too low __PUNCT__ and i think spend is too high __PUNCT__
the govern out of control spend ha result in a weaker dollar __PUNCT__ rais the cost of groceri and gasolin __PUNCT__ and kill job __PUNCT__
i will veto pork barrel legisl and cut wast govern spend __PUNCT__
senat obama ha a differ plan __PUNCT__
accord to third parti estim __PUNCT__ he will increas govern spend by over __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
he ha deni it __PUNCT__ but he ha refus to tell you how much he doe plan to spend __PUNCT__
what is the total of hi increas spend __PUNCT__ american deserv to know just how much more of their monei senat obama intend to spend __PUNCT__ and how much more debt he plan to burden them with __PUNCT__
senat obama ha also critic earmark spend __PUNCT__ those wast pork barrel project stuck in spend bill behind close door __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ despit hi talk on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ hi actual record is full of request for earmark project __PUNCT__
in hi three short year in the senat __PUNCT__ he ha request nearli a billion dollar in pork project for hi state __PUNCT__ a million dollar for everi dai he been in offic __PUNCT__
far from fight earmark in congress __PUNCT__ senat obama ha been an eager particip in thi corrupt system __PUNCT__
in on instanc __PUNCT__ he sought more than __NUM__ million dollar for a new projector at a planetarium in hi hometown __PUNCT__
coincident __PUNCT__ the chairman of that planetarium pledg to rais more than __MONEY__ for senat obama campaign __PUNCT__
we don't know if thei ever discuss the monei for the planetarium __PUNCT__ and no on ha ask senat obama __PUNCT__
but even the appear of thi kind of insid __PUNCT__ deal disgust american __PUNCT__
i go to put a stop to that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ if i presid __PUNCT__
i have made everi singl donor to my campaign publicli avail __PUNCT__ while senat obama ha taken in over __NUM__ million dollar from undisclos sourc __PUNCT__
we have alreadi seen the potenti for fraud becaus of hi refus to disclos hi donor __PUNCT__
hi campaign had to return __MONEY__ in illeg foreign fund from palestinian donor __PUNCT__ and thi weekend __PUNCT__ we found out about anoth __MONEY__ in illeg donat __PUNCT__
why ha senat obama refus to disclos the peopl who ar fund hi campaign __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ the american peopl deserv answer __PUNCT__
on health care __PUNCT__ senat obama ha been mislead you about my plan to give you more monei for health care __PUNCT__ and he ha been equal mislead about hi own plan __PUNCT__
he ha said hi goal is a singl payer system where govern is in charg of health care and bureaucrat stand between you and your doctor __PUNCT__
under the plan he ha propos __PUNCT__ he will fine famili that don't have the kind of health insur that senat obama tell them to purchas __PUNCT__
he will fine employ who do not offer the health insur that he think thei should offer __PUNCT__
what he doesn't sai __PUNCT__ and what nobodi ha ask __PUNCT__ is how big hi fine will be __PUNCT__
what he doesn't want you to know is that with a small fine __PUNCT__ hi plan will encourag compani to just pai the fine __PUNCT__ drop exist health care coverag for their employe and leav them with onli on real option __PUNCT__ govern run health care __PUNCT__
who is the real senat obama __PUNCT__ is he the candid who promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__ or the politician who vote to rais middl class tax __PUNCT__ is he the candid who talk about regul or the politician who took monei from fanni mae and freddi mac and turn a blind ey as thei ran our economi into a ditch __PUNCT__ is he the candid who promis chang __PUNCT__ or is he the politician who ha bought into everyth that is wrong with washington __PUNCT__ we can't chang the system with someon who never fought the system __PUNCT__
washington is on the wrong track and i go to set it right __PUNCT__
the american peopl know my record __PUNCT__
thei know i am go to chang washington __PUNCT__ becaus i done it befor __PUNCT__
thei know i go to reform our broken institut in washington and on wall street becaus i done it befor __PUNCT__
thei know i go to deliv relief to the middl class __PUNCT__ becaus that what i done __PUNCT__

i been fight for you my whole life __PUNCT__
that what i go to do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
