i will impos a spend freez on all but the most vital function of govern __PUNCT__
i will review everi agenc of the feder govern __PUNCT__ improv those that need to be improv and elimin those that aren't work for the american peopl __PUNCT__
i will confront the ten trillion __PUNCT__ dollar debt that the feder govern ha run up __PUNCT__ and balanc the feder budget by the end of my term in offic __PUNCT__
thi is the agenda i have set befor my fellow citizen __PUNCT__
and the same standard of clariti and candor must now be appli to my oppon __PUNCT__
we have all heard what he ha said __PUNCT__ but it is less clear what he ha done or what he will do __PUNCT__
rather than answer hi critic __PUNCT__ senat obama will try to distract you from notic that he never answer the seriou and legitim question he ha been ask __PUNCT__
he ha even question my truth __PUNCT__
and let me repli in the plainest term i know __PUNCT__
i don't need lesson about tell the truth to american peopl __PUNCT__
and were i ever to need ani improv in that regard __PUNCT__ i probabl wouldn't seek advic from a chicago politician __PUNCT__
what wa my oppon actual record in the year befor the great econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ thi crisi start in our hous market in the form of subprim loan that were push on peopl who could not afford them __PUNCT__
bad mortgag were be back by fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and it wa onli a matter of time befor a contagion of unsustain debt began to spread __PUNCT__
at the time __PUNCT__ i call for tighter restrict on fanni mae and freddi mac that could have help prevent thi crisi from happen in the first place __PUNCT__
my oppon wa silent on the regul of fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and hi democrat alli in congress oppos everi effort to rein them in __PUNCT__
barack obama most notabl involv with the hous issu wa to be take campaign monei from execut of fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ the veri peopl who were caus the problem __PUNCT__
on health care __PUNCT__ barack obama ha been mislead on two front __PUNCT__
under the plan he ha propos __PUNCT__ he will fine employ who do not offer health insur and put their employe in govern health care __PUNCT__
what he doesn't sai __PUNCT__ and what nobodi ha ask __PUNCT__ is how big hi fine will be __PUNCT__
you deserv an answer __PUNCT__ and you sure didn't get in tuesdai night debat __PUNCT__
so let me give it anoth try __PUNCT__ someon need to ask senat obama to pleas specifi the amount of the fine he will impos on the employ of america __PUNCT__
and while you at it __PUNCT__ ask employ how these new order and fine from the feder govern ar go to help them creat a singl new job in a struggl economi __PUNCT__
again on tax __PUNCT__ we see a differ between what senat obama sai todai __PUNCT__ what he said yesterdai __PUNCT__ and what he ha actual done __PUNCT__
dure the democrat primari __PUNCT__ he promis to doubl tax on everi american with a dividend or an invest __PUNCT__
he promis to rais payrol tax __PUNCT__
he promis higher tax on electr __PUNCT__
he vote for the democrat budget resolut that promis to rais tax on peopl make just __NUM__ dollar a year __PUNCT__
and now all of the sudden senat obama claim he will give __NUM__ percent of american tax relief __PUNCT__
what he hasn't told you is that he would tax half of the incom of small busi in america __PUNCT__
these ar the peopl who have actual ad __NUM__ job at a time when america lost __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
thei ar the backbon of our economi __PUNCT__ and our best hope to get america back on track __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ their tax ar go down instead of up __PUNCT__ and we go to help them creat job for america __PUNCT__
on spend __PUNCT__ barack obama will increas govern spend by over __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
that on top of the trillion in debt that we alreadi burden our children and grandchildren with __PUNCT__
he claim in our debat that somehow he still end up with a net cut in spend __PUNCT__ onli barack obama could sell an __NUM__ billion dollar feder spend increas as a net reduct in feder spend __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ the spend reduct will be real __PUNCT__ and i cut the size of govern __PUNCT__
i will put the govern back on the side of america work famili __PUNCT__ and i will get thi countri move again __PUNCT__
then there the matter of earmark __PUNCT__
in hi three short year in the senat __PUNCT__ he ha request nearli a billion dollar in pork __PUNCT__ barrel project for hi state __PUNCT__ a million dollar for everi dai he been in offic __PUNCT__
in our debat __PUNCT__ i mention the exampl of the more than __NUM__ million dollar he sought for a new projector at a planetarium in hi hometown __PUNCT__
i could have mention hi vote for that bridg to nowher __PUNCT__ but the planetarium is in some wai a more interest case __PUNCT__
i guess it wa sheer coincid that the chairman of that planetarium pledg to rais more than __MONEY__ for senat obama campaign __PUNCT__
even the appear of thi kind of insid __PUNCT__ deal disgust american __PUNCT__
i go to put a stop to that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ if i presid __PUNCT__
washington is on the wrong track and i go to set it right __PUNCT__
