so __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter realli what my definit of __PUNCT__ rich __PUNCT__ is becaus i don't want to rais anybodi tax __PUNCT__
i realli don't __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i want to give work american a better shot at have a better life __PUNCT__ and we all know the challeng __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ if i could be seriou __PUNCT__
american tonight in california and all over america ar sit at the kitchen tabl __PUNCT__ recent and suddenli lost a job __PUNCT__ can't afford to stai in their home __PUNCT__ educ for their kid __PUNCT__ afford health care __PUNCT__
these ar tough problem __PUNCT__

i can lead __PUNCT__ and i know that our best dai ar ahead of us __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ warren __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we got a coupl minut left in thi section __PUNCT__
here a secur question i didn't get to with senat obama __PUNCT__
we didn't have enough time __PUNCT__
when is our right to privaci __PUNCT__ when our right to privaci and our right to nation secur collid __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it doe __PUNCT__
warren __PUNCT__ how do you decid what take preced __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it doe collid __PUNCT__ and there ar alwai compet prioriti __PUNCT__
we must preserv the privaci of all of our citizen as much as possibl becaus that is on of the fundament and basic right we have __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ includ a secret ballot for union organ __PUNCT__ a secret ballot __PUNCT__ not a ballot that someon come around and sign you up __PUNCT__
that a differ subject __PUNCT__ but the point is that we have now had technolog advanc over the last __NUM__ or __NUM__ year in commun that ar remark __PUNCT__
it is remark abil that our enemi have to commun __PUNCT__ so we have to keep up with that capabl __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ there ar too mani wai __PUNCT__ through cyberspac and through other wai __PUNCT__ that peopl ar abl to commun with on anoth __PUNCT__
so we ar go to have to step up our capabl to monitor those __PUNCT__
sometim there ar call from outsid the unit state __PUNCT__ insid the unit state __PUNCT__
there ar all kind of commun of everi differ kind __PUNCT__
so you need congress to work togeth __PUNCT__
you need a judiciari that will review these law that we pass __PUNCT__ and at the same time __PUNCT__ it just an exampl of our failur to sit down __PUNCT__ republican and democrat __PUNCT__ and work these thing out togeth for the good of the nation secur instead of thi constant fight __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ accord to our director of nation intellig __PUNCT__ until we final reach an agreement not long ago __PUNCT__ wa compromis our abil to keep america from attack __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ there is a constant tension __PUNCT__ it is chang with chang in technolog __PUNCT__ and we have to stai up with it __PUNCT__
warren __PUNCT__ we be right back with senat john mccain __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ warren __PUNCT__ welcom back to saddleback civil forum on the presid __PUNCT__ and we ar here with senat john mccain __PUNCT__
john __PUNCT__ these last question ar about america respons to the world __PUNCT__
we ar without a doubt the most bless nation in the world __PUNCT__
we ar bless to be a bless __PUNCT__ and the bibl sai to whom much is given much ha been requir __PUNCT__
so i want to talk about what is our stewardship to everybodi els __PUNCT__ and let first talk about freedom and war __PUNCT__
as an american __PUNCT__ what is worth dy for __PUNCT__ and what is worth commit american live for __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ our nation secur __PUNCT__ our secur as a nation __PUNCT__
war have start in obscur place that have envelop us __PUNCT__
we also must temper that with the abil to effect and benefici caus the outcom that we want __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ there is tyranni and there is tragedi throughout the world __PUNCT__ and we can't right everi wrong __PUNCT__ but we can do what america ha done throughout our histori __PUNCT__ and that is be a beacon of hope and liberti and freedom for everyon in the world __PUNCT__ as ronald reagan us to quot __PUNCT__ a shine citi on a hill __PUNCT__
and so there ar conflict that we can't settl __PUNCT__
the most preciou asset we have is american blood __PUNCT__ and throughout our histori american have gone to all four corner of the world and shed that blood in defens of someon els freedom __PUNCT__
no other nation on earth ha ever done that __PUNCT__ but we have also succeed in other wai __PUNCT__
we won the cold war __PUNCT__ as i mention earlier __PUNCT__ without fire a shot becaus of our ideolog that commun wa wrong and evil and we can defeat it __PUNCT__ just as we can defeat radic islam extrem __PUNCT__
can we talk just a second about the latest in georgia __PUNCT__ warren __PUNCT__ let me ask you thi __PUNCT__ what would be the criteria for which you would commit troop to __PUNCT__
