eighti __PUNCT__ four percent of the american peopl think the countri is on the wrong track __PUNCT__
in our parti __PUNCT__ we have corrupt __PUNCT__
we have former member of congress resid in feder prison __PUNCT__
so it not surpris to me that we seen an incred invigor around our parti and around the nation __PUNCT__
not just republican __PUNCT__ but democrat __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ in the last dai __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__ or whatev it ha been __PUNCT__ we have rais __MONEY__ million on the internet __PUNCT__
i wish i had have taken her a month ago __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but you have said that the existenti threat we face __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ the threat to our exist is from islam terror __PUNCT__
foreign polici is job on for the command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ you have critic obama as be __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ danger unprepar to be presid __PUNCT__
in the sens of nation secur and foreign polici specif __PUNCT__ isn't sarah palin even more danger unprepar __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ she ha got the right judgment __PUNCT__
she ha got the right judgment __PUNCT__
she doesn't think __PUNCT__ like senat obama doe __PUNCT__ that iran is a minor irrit __PUNCT__
she know that the surg work and succeed __PUNCT__ and she support that __PUNCT__
senat obama still __PUNCT__ still to thi dai refus to acknowledg that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
she ha been command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief of the alaska guard __PUNCT__ that ha serv back and back __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ she ha got a son who is get readi to go __PUNCT__
but she ha had the judgment on these issu and __PUNCT__ that senat obama ha not had in the __PUNCT__ he ha had all the wrong judgment __PUNCT__
and governor palin understand these issu __PUNCT__ and she understand the challeng that we face __PUNCT__
so she ha had __NUM__ year of elect offic experi __PUNCT__ includ travel to kuwait __PUNCT__ includ be involv in these issu __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ i so proud that she ha displai the kind of judgment and she ha the experi and judgment as an execut __PUNCT__
she ha run a huge economi up there in the state of alaska __PUNCT__
twenti percent of our energi come from the state of alaska __PUNCT__ and energi is obvious on of the kei issu for our nation secur __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ you talk about her year of experi __PUNCT__
ten of those year were as a citi councilwoman and mayor of a town of __NUM__ peopl __PUNCT__
and in term of foreign polici __PUNCT__ in march of __NUM__ after __PUNCT__ two month after the surg had start __PUNCT__ she wa ask about it __PUNCT__ and she said __PUNCT__ i been focus on state govern __PUNCT__
i haven't focus on the war in iraq __PUNCT__
understand for a governor __PUNCT__ not understand for a vice presid __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ also she wa a member of the pta __PUNCT__
i think it wonder __PUNCT__
but the point is she ha been to kuwait __PUNCT__
she ha been over there __PUNCT__
she ha been with her troop __PUNCT__ the nation guard that she command __PUNCT__ who had been over there and had the experi __PUNCT__
i proud of her knowledg of these challeng and issu __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ as governor she ha had enorm respons __PUNCT__ none of which senat obama had __PUNCT__
he __PUNCT__ when she wa in govern __PUNCT__ he wa a commun organ __PUNCT__
when she wa take tough posit against her own parti __PUNCT__ senat obama wa vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__ __NUM__ time in the state legislatur __PUNCT__ on everi tough issu whatev it wa __PUNCT__ while she wa take them on __PUNCT__
that the kind of judgment that i confid that we need in washington __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ for peopl who aren't persuad __PUNCT__ at least initi in the first __NUM__ hour __PUNCT__ about her experi __PUNCT__ especi on foreign polici __PUNCT__ doesn't thi rais even more concern about your ag __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ it wa an issu in the primari __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__
i got to show them the vigor __PUNCT__
i got to show them the energi __PUNCT__
i got to show them the judgment __PUNCT__
i got to show them that my experi and knowledg qualifi me to lead __PUNCT__
and what we ar find out in recent dai in a coupl of week is an increasingli danger world __PUNCT__
but most importantli __PUNCT__ that i know how to get the job back and get our economi go again __PUNCT__
but i got to show them that __PUNCT__
i understand that __PUNCT__
but i also think that you got the next gener of leadership of america who is commit to good govern __PUNCT__ to ethic __PUNCT__ a wonder famili __PUNCT__ a belief in the futur of america __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i so excit about thi person __PUNCT__ governor palin __PUNCT__ i can't tell you __PUNCT__
and her famili is marvel __PUNCT__ also __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ the choic of a run mate is the first presidenti __PUNCT__ level decis that you made __PUNCT__
why shouldn't we think that thi is realli about polit __PUNCT__ about reach out to women __PUNCT__ especi to hillari clinton support __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think that i had to do what i think is best for the futur of the countri __PUNCT__
that the point here __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ by ani paramet of judgment __PUNCT__ given the econom difficulti that we face todai __PUNCT__ especi on job and health care and insur __PUNCT__ these ar issu __PUNCT__ health insur and educ __PUNCT__ these ar the issu that __PUNCT__ realli __PUNCT__ american ar most concern about __PUNCT__
american ar concern about our nation secur __PUNCT__
and i think she ha exercis and shown the judgment to address those issu __PUNCT__
but she also understand the fact that peopl in america ar sit down at the kitchen tabl thi morn __PUNCT__ as we speak __PUNCT__ and sai __PUNCT__ how ar we go to stai in our home __PUNCT__ how ar we go to keep our health insur __PUNCT__ how ar we go to educ our kid __PUNCT__ and some of them have just lost their job __PUNCT__
so i think governor palin is uniqu __PUNCT__ as a governor __PUNCT__ she ha had execut experi __PUNCT__
she didn't sit in the state legislatur __PUNCT__
she didn't vote just with her parti and go along to get along __PUNCT__
senat obama ha never taken on the leader of hi parti on ani issu __PUNCT__
you tell me a time when he had __PUNCT__
she ha been an independ spirit that ha taken them on at everi opportun __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ whether thi wa the reason or not __PUNCT__ do you think she will help you with women and especi with disaffect hillari clinton support __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think she go to help me with all american __PUNCT__
i think that the respons that we get from men __PUNCT__ women __PUNCT__ young __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ becaus thei want us to chang america __PUNCT__
thei want us to chang it __PUNCT__
thei sick and tire of busi as usual and insid the beltwai kind of thing __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ on comment said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ she ha never been on __PUNCT__ meet the press __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ i didn't sai that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i hope that she on your program first __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ she doesn't live insid the beltwai __PUNCT__
she doesn't __PUNCT__ she and her husband don't go to the georgetown cocktail parti __PUNCT__
but thei do live a life of a wonder famili __PUNCT__
he __PUNCT__ thei had a small busi __PUNCT__
thei ar just realli good __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ earth peopl who understand the challeng that we face __PUNCT__

wallac __PUNCT__ the democrat point out at the convent that you have vote __NUM__ time against rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__
thei sai the onli reason you vote for it in __NUM__ wa becaus it wa link to war fund __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the point is that i have vote to keep tax low and to cut tax __PUNCT__
and senat obama ha vote to rais them consist __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but why have you been __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__ against the minimum wage __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ even on peopl as low as __MONEY__
i for the minimum wage increas when thei ar not attach to other big __PUNCT__ spend pork barrel __PUNCT__
the practic in washington is attach a good thing to a bad thing __PUNCT__
and that wai __PUNCT__ then you have to vote ye or no __PUNCT__
the energi bill __PUNCT__ the energi bill had a lot of good thing in it __PUNCT__ and it billion of dollar of pork and good deal for the oil compani __PUNCT__
senat obama vote for it __PUNCT__

harri reid will sai __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ we let you vote on offshor drill __PUNCT__

you can't just have a straight up or down vote __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ i go to veto everi bill that doesn't have straight up or down vote on the issu that ar import to the american peopl __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ you would have been for __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i certainli __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ alon __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__ after the increas in the __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i certainli __PUNCT__

minimum wage __PUNCT__ even though you vote against it __PUNCT__ i said __NUM__ it wa actual __NUM__ time __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ or __NUM__ or __NUM__ whatev it is __PUNCT__
the fact is that i am for a live wage for all american __PUNCT__
and i like to see them get it __PUNCT__

so __PUNCT__ i am commit __PUNCT__ and my record clearli show that i done everyth i can to keep their tax low __PUNCT__ to get them avail and afford health insur __PUNCT__ and to secur a good educ and give them a choic __PUNCT__ not be govern by the teacher __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ obama also said that you ar dip into the old partisan playbook __PUNCT__ question charact and patriot __PUNCT__
and then he said thi to you directli __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ i got new for you __PUNCT__ john mccain __PUNCT__
we all put our countri first __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i have no doubt about senat obama patriot __PUNCT__
i have grave doubt and concern about hi judgment __PUNCT__ whether it would be on sai that iran is a tini problem __PUNCT__ about sai that the surg wouldn't work __PUNCT__ that it wa doom to failur __PUNCT__ and still __PUNCT__ incred __PUNCT__ sai that the surg ha not succeed __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ __URL__ everi __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ when you said __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ to hi first respons __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ if i mai __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ when you sai he doesn't think it matter whether we win or lose __PUNCT__ when you sai __PUNCT__ he would rather lose a war to win a polit campaign __PUNCT__ isn't that question hi patriot __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it question hi judgment __PUNCT__
he went out to run for the nomin of hi parti and took the far left posit __PUNCT__ __URL__
in fact __PUNCT__ when __URL__ ran an ad __PUNCT__ a full __PUNCT__ page ad in the new york time __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ gener petraeu or gener betrai __PUNCT__ us __PUNCT__ and we had a resolut on the floor of the senat condemn that __PUNCT__ thi great man __PUNCT__ these terribl aspers on hi courag and hi reput __PUNCT__ he refus to vote __PUNCT__
he wa on __PUNCT__ he wa in the senat at the time __PUNCT__ refus to vote on it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ he went to the left of hi parti on the war in order to secur the nomin of hi parti __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i think that veri clear __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ we have to take a break here __PUNCT__
but when we come back __PUNCT__ we have much more for the senat __PUNCT__ includ the charg from a former presid that he is milk hi statu as a pow for polit gain __PUNCT__
back in a moment __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ wallac __PUNCT__ and we back now with senat john mccain __PUNCT__
senat __PUNCT__ former presid carter said thi week __PUNCT__ hi word __PUNCT__ not mine __PUNCT__ that you have been milk everi possibl drop of advantag from your five year as a prison of war in vietnam __PUNCT__
the presid said __PUNCT__ at the saddleback forum with rick warren __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ john mccain wa abl to weav in hi experi in a vietnam prison camp __PUNCT__ no matter what the question wa __PUNCT__
your respons __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i have great respect for former presid carter __PUNCT__
but it not the first time we disagre __PUNCT__ hi statement about israel and the palestinian __PUNCT__
and the wai he conduct hi presid i respect __PUNCT__
but i vigor disagre with mani of the thing that __PUNCT__ activ that he ha had sinc __PUNCT__
i think he a man of veri good heart and veri __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but ar you offend by hi suggest that you milk your pow __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i have respect for presid carter __PUNCT__ and i don't think most american share that view __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ most of my support sai __PUNCT__ talk more about your experi __PUNCT__
and thei were form experi __PUNCT__
and pastor rick warren want to know not onli our posit on the issu __PUNCT__ but what our makeup wa __PUNCT__ and why we feel that we think it import to serv thi countri in the highest and most respons posit __PUNCT__ the most power posit in the world __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i pleas to have been abl to talk to so mani american in a straightforward fashion __PUNCT__ and tell them about why i am the person i am todai __PUNCT__
if we would have had thi convers a month ago __PUNCT__ we wouldn't have been __PUNCT__ had a word about georgia __PUNCT__ a tini countri a long wai awai __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we don't know what around the corner of histori __PUNCT__ and we have to judg peopl charact __PUNCT__
and my charact __PUNCT__ a great part of the format of that charact took place in a prison camp __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ as we sit here todai __PUNCT__ on saturdai __PUNCT__ hurrican gustav is bear down on the gulf coast __PUNCT__
ar there ani circumst under which you would consid suspend the republican convent __PUNCT__ if the hurrican realli bash that part of the countri __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i afraid __PUNCT__ chri __PUNCT__ that we mai have to look at that situat __PUNCT__ and we try and monitor it __PUNCT__
i been talk to governor jindal __PUNCT__ barbour __PUNCT__ rilei __PUNCT__ crist __PUNCT__
i been talk to all of them __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it just __PUNCT__ it wouldn't be appropri to have a festiv occas while a near tragedi or a terribl challeng is present in the form of a natur disast __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we monitor it from dai to dai __PUNCT__ and i sai a few prayer __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but what would you do __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we would have to __PUNCT__ we look at variou option __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ i don't know exactli what we would do __PUNCT__ becaus you don't know how sever it is __PUNCT__ where it go to hit __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ but i mean __PUNCT__ ar you serious __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__
talk about suspend the convent __PUNCT__ not hold it for a dai or two __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ at least some of the activ __PUNCT__ or mayb devot some of the activ to bring american peopl attent to try to help it victim __PUNCT__
but right now __PUNCT__ it too earli __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__
all we do right now is explor the variou option __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ in the wake of katrina __PUNCT__ and a percept __PUNCT__ at least __PUNCT__ of republican failur __PUNCT__ would it look bad for your parti to be conduct busi as usual while peopl ar realli suffer on the gulf coast __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ we don't want to appear in ani wai festiv when you have that kind of tragedi possibl revisit itself on the citi of new orlean and area around it __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we be judg it dai by dai and look at the option __PUNCT__
but right now __PUNCT__ our prayer ar that it doesn't hit __PUNCT__ at least in heavili popul area __PUNCT__
it pretti clear __PUNCT__ at least at thi moment __PUNCT__ that it go to hit somewher __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ and also __PUNCT__ might i sai __PUNCT__ i think that we ar far __PUNCT__ far better prepar than we were the last time __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ just four month ago __PUNCT__ you told shepard smith on fox new the kind of campaign that you intend to run __PUNCT__
you said thi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ american want a respect campaign __PUNCT__
now peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ neg ad move number __PUNCT__
thei mai __PUNCT__
but do we have to go to the lowest common denomin __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ wallac __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ in the last two month __PUNCT__ you run ad compar barack obama to __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ wallac __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you laugh as i sai thi __PUNCT__ to pari hilton and britnei spear __PUNCT__
you run an ad charg __PUNCT__ perhap accur __PUNCT__ that he got help bui hi home from a convict felon __PUNCT__
what happen to your pledg to run a respect campaign __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i think it respect __PUNCT__
but first of all __PUNCT__ i also at that time ask senat obama to go to town hall meet with me __PUNCT__
we could appear in front of the american peopl the wai barri goldwat and jack kennedi had pledg to do __PUNCT__
i tell you __PUNCT__ that chang the tenor of a campaign __PUNCT__ i know becaus i done them in the past __PUNCT__
and unfortun senat obama refus to go to town hall meet with me and appear befor the american peopl so we can both answer their question and comment __PUNCT__
second of all __PUNCT__ i thought __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ that those ad draw differ between our posit __PUNCT__
he is against offshor drill __PUNCT__ he want to rais tax __PUNCT__
but the other thing __PUNCT__ i thought thei were pretti humor __PUNCT__
and for those peopl who have lost their sens of humor __PUNCT__ turn of your comput __PUNCT__ go out __PUNCT__ get a breath of fresh air and get your humor back __PUNCT__
so we go to __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ so there a big laugh about toni rezko __PUNCT__ a convict felon help him __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i think that thei should laugh when thei see charlton heston __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ but look __PUNCT__ there ar seriou issu __PUNCT__ there ar seriou issu __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ you don't think your campaign ha gone neg in the last two month __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
we have certainli drawn the differ and we will continu to draw those differ __PUNCT__
and i might add __PUNCT__ and that the neg ad that were begun long ago by the democrat nation committe that continu to thi dai by the obama campaign ar someth we understand __PUNCT__
i a big boi __PUNCT__
but we will continu to draw the differ between ourselv and __PUNCT__ myself and senat obama __PUNCT__ particularli sinc he ha a tendenc to shift those posit __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ obama and democrat continu to try to wrap presid bush around you __PUNCT__
