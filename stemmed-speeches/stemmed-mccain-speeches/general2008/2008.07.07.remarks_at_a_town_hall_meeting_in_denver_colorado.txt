i believ the role of govern is to unleash the creativ __PUNCT__ ingenu and hard work of the american peopl __PUNCT__ and make it easier to creat job __PUNCT__
at it core __PUNCT__ the economi isn't the sum of an arrai of bewild statist __PUNCT__
it about where american work __PUNCT__ how thei live __PUNCT__ how thei pai their bill todai and save for tomorrow __PUNCT__
it about small busi open their door __PUNCT__ hire employe and grow __PUNCT__
it about give worker the educ and train to find a good job and prosper in it __PUNCT__
it about the aspir of the american peopl to build a better life for their famili __PUNCT__ dream that begin with a job __PUNCT__
so how ar we go to creat good job __PUNCT__ let start with small busi __PUNCT__ which creat the major of all job __PUNCT__
a recent report sai small busi have creat __NUM__ job so far thi year while other sector ar lose job __PUNCT__
small busi ar the job engin of america __PUNCT__ and i will make it easier for them to grow and creat more job __PUNCT__
my oppon want to make it harder by impos a __PUNCT__ pai or plai __PUNCT__ health mandat on small busi __PUNCT__
thi add __MONEY__ to the cost of emploi anyon with a famili __PUNCT__
that mean new job will not be creat __PUNCT__
