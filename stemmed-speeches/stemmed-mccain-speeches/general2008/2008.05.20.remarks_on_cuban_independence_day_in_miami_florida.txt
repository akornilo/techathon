so must it be for all american who cherish those freedom we so often take for grant at home __PUNCT__

and yet todai __PUNCT__ the cuban peopl continu to live under tyranni __PUNCT__ and their struggl goe on __PUNCT__

on dai __PUNCT__ cuba will be an import alli in advanc democraci throughout our hemispher __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ cuba is destin to be free __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ as so mani of you know too well __PUNCT__ the situat is veri differ __PUNCT__
fidel castro ha pass the titl of power to hi brother in a fashion suit more for a person fiefdom than to a govern purport to repres that proud and dynam peopl __PUNCT__
a few recent new articl have label as __PUNCT__ reform __PUNCT__ the smatter of small chang that have taken place sinc raul castro ha formal taken charg __PUNCT__
such character must sound quit cynic to the polit prison that fill cuban jail __PUNCT__ to the million who suffer under poverti and repress __PUNCT__ and to all those who wish to choos their leader __PUNCT__ not suffer under them __PUNCT__
the castro regim enforc strict limit against freedom of express __PUNCT__ of associ __PUNCT__ of assembl __PUNCT__ of movement __PUNCT__ of speech __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ as mani as __NUM__ citizen serv sentenc for the vagu crime of __PUNCT__ danger __PUNCT__
yet tyranni will not forev endur __PUNCT__ and as presid __PUNCT__ i will not passiv await the dai when the cuban peopl enjoi the bless of freedom and democraci __PUNCT__
it is in our nation interest to support their aspir and oppos those of the castro regim __PUNCT__ on that harbor fugit from u. __PUNCT__ justic __PUNCT__ express unrel hostil to america __PUNCT__ and shoot down unarm civilian aircraft __PUNCT__
i wish the other presidenti candid felt similarli __PUNCT__
just a few year ago __PUNCT__ senat obama had a veri clear view on cuba __PUNCT__
when ask in a questionnair about hi polici toward cuba __PUNCT__ he answer __PUNCT__ i believ that normal of relat with cuba would help the oppress and poverti __PUNCT__ stricken cuban peopl while set the stage for a more democrat govern onc castro inevit leav the scene __PUNCT__
now senat obama ha shift posit and sai he onli favor eas the embargo __PUNCT__ not lift it __PUNCT__
he also want to sit down uncondition for a presidenti meet with raul castro __PUNCT__
these step would send the worst possibl signal to cuba dictat __PUNCT__ there is no need to undertak fundament reform __PUNCT__ thei can simpli wait for a unilater chang in us polici __PUNCT__
i believ we should give hope to the cuban peopl __PUNCT__ not to the castro regim __PUNCT__
my administr will press the cuban regim to releas all polit prison uncondition __PUNCT__ to legal all polit parti __PUNCT__ labor union __PUNCT__ and free media __PUNCT__ and to schedul internation monitor elect __PUNCT__
the embargo must stai in place until these basic element of democrat societi ar met __PUNCT__
maintain the embargo is __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ just on element of a broader approach my administr would make to the peopl of cuba __PUNCT__
i would provid more materi assist and moral support to the courag human right activist who brave defi the regim everi dai __PUNCT__ and increas radio and tv marti and other mean to commun directli with the cuban peopl __PUNCT__
my justic depart would vigor prosecut cuban offici implic in the murder of american __PUNCT__ drug traffick __PUNCT__ and other crime __PUNCT__
while our cuba polici will not alwai be in accord with that of our hemispher and european partner __PUNCT__ my administr will begin an activ dialogu with them to develop a plan for post __PUNCT__ castro cuba __PUNCT__ a plan that will spark rapid chang and a new awaken in that countri __PUNCT__
the cuban peopl have wait long enough __PUNCT__
as we work with our hemispher partner __PUNCT__ we must be clear about the kind of leadership america seek to provid __PUNCT__
for decad __PUNCT__ in republican and democrat administr alik __PUNCT__ the unit state ha treat latin america as a junior partner rather than as a neighbor __PUNCT__ like a littl brother rather than as an equal __PUNCT__
as a resid of a state that border mexico __PUNCT__ i am acut awar of the extraordinari contribut that our neighbor make to the unit state __PUNCT__ from trade to cultur to a commit to democraci and human right __PUNCT__
latin america todai is increasingli vital to the fortun of the unit state __PUNCT__ and american north and south share a common geographi and a common destini __PUNCT__
it is time to embrac thi destini for the benefit of all our peopl __PUNCT__
we have made progress toward thi vision by expand the benefit of free commerc __PUNCT__ through nafta __PUNCT__ the central american free trade agreement __PUNCT__ and our free trade agreement with peru and chile __PUNCT__
but the progress ha stall __PUNCT__ our longstand bipartisan commit to hemispher prosper is crumbl __PUNCT__
we see thi most vividli in barack obama and hillari clinton opposit to the free trade agreement with colombia __PUNCT__
the failur of the congress to take up and approv thi agreement is a remind why __NUM__ percent of american think we ar on the wrong track __PUNCT__
congress can find time to pass a pork __PUNCT__ fill farm bill __PUNCT__ but it cannot stir itself to support a kei alli and further american prosper __PUNCT__
the colombia fta would benefit american worker and consum __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ intern trade administr estim that over __MONEY__ billion in tariff have been impos on u. __PUNCT__ export to colombia sinc the fta wa sign __PUNCT__ tariff that would be elimin onc the agreement take effect __PUNCT__
here in florida __PUNCT__ trade ha creat new market for the sunshin state world __PUNCT__ class produc __PUNCT__ manufactur good __PUNCT__ and profession servic __PUNCT__
florida export to canada and mexico rose by some __NUM__ percent sinc nafta wa enact __PUNCT__ and it export to chile grew __NUM__ percent in the first four year of it free trade agreement __PUNCT__
colombia todai stand as florida fifth largest export market __PUNCT__ florida export __MONEY__ billion worth of good there last year __PUNCT__ and now the colombian ar offer to drop their barrier to american good __PUNCT__
yet senat obama and clinton oppos the agreement __PUNCT__ wish to retreat behind protectionist wall and undermin a kei hemispher alli __PUNCT__
the strateg implic of reject thi agreement ar profound __PUNCT__
colombia is a beacon of hope in a region where the castro brother __PUNCT__ hugo chavez __PUNCT__ and other ar activ seek to thwart econom progress and democraci __PUNCT__
delai approv of the colombian free trade agreement will not creat on american job or start on american busi __PUNCT__ but it will divid us from our colombian partner at a time when thei ar battl the farc terrorist and their alli drug cartel __PUNCT__
it will undercut america stand with our alli in a critic region and across the world __PUNCT__ at a moment when rebuild these relationship ha never been more import __PUNCT__
it will set back the goal of deepen relat with our neighbor to the south and enhanc the stabil __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ and prosper of our hemispher __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ the unit state will not bow to the special interest seek to block progress __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we will forg a new polici toward latin america and the caribbean basin __PUNCT__ on found on peac and secur __PUNCT__ share prosper __PUNCT__ democraci and freedom __PUNCT__ and mutual respect __PUNCT__
we will work to prevent venezuela and bolivia from take the same road to failur castro ha pave for cuba __PUNCT__ and we will broaden and strengthen ti with kei state like brazil __PUNCT__ peru __PUNCT__ and chile __PUNCT__
we will make clear to all countri in the region that if thei share our valu of freedom and open __PUNCT__ thei can count on us as a friend __PUNCT__
we will not abandon our partner to demagogu __PUNCT__ drug lord __PUNCT__ and despair __PUNCT__ but expand the benefit of secur __PUNCT__ trade and prosper to all __PUNCT__
my vision embodi the interest and the valu of america and seek the better of all peopl __PUNCT__ everywher in our hemispher __PUNCT__
and it is a vision that includ the peopl of cuba __PUNCT__
courag men found their call at the begin of the last centuri in win for cuba it independ __PUNCT__
and those brave men and women who stand up for their right todai will __PUNCT__ on dai soon __PUNCT__ win for cuba it freedom __PUNCT__
when thei do __PUNCT__ thei will enjoi not onli the fruit of their own liber __PUNCT__ but also the firm and fast friendship of all american who have stood with them throughout the year of struggl __PUNCT__
