i john mccain __PUNCT__ and thi week the presidenti contest wa a long __PUNCT__ distanc affair __PUNCT__ with my oppon tour variou contin and arriv yesterdai in pari __PUNCT__
with all the breathless coverag from abroad __PUNCT__ and with senat obama now address hi speech to __PUNCT__ the peopl of the world __PUNCT__ i start to feel a littl left out __PUNCT__
mayb you ar too __PUNCT__
back here in the countri that we ar compet to lead __PUNCT__ a lot folk were have troubl try to squar senat obama multipl posit on the surg in iraq __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ he oppos the surg and confid predict that it would fail __PUNCT__
then he tri to prevent fund for the troop who carri out the surg __PUNCT__
but now that it clear that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__ and brought victori in iraq within sight __PUNCT__ senat obama can't quit bring himself to admit hi own failur in judgment __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he commit the even greater error of insist that even in hindsight __PUNCT__ he would still oppos the surg __PUNCT__
even in retrospect __PUNCT__ he would choos the path of retreat and failur for america over the path of success and victori __PUNCT__
that not exactli my idea of the judgment we seek in a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__
oddli enough __PUNCT__ my oppon advoc the deploy of two new combat brigad to afghanistan __PUNCT__ in other word __PUNCT__ a surg __PUNCT__
we left to wonder how he can deni that the surg in iraq ha succeed __PUNCT__ while at the same time announc that a surg is just what we need in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i leav all these question for my oppon and hi team of __NUM__ foreign polici advisor to work out for themselv __PUNCT__
with luck __PUNCT__ thei get their stori straight by the time the obama campaign return to north america __PUNCT__
i spent the past week in main __PUNCT__ upstat new york __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ maryland __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ and colorado __PUNCT__
and i spoke with voter about how to get the american economi run at full strength again __PUNCT__
we need to stai focus on creat job for our peopl __PUNCT__ and protect paycheck from the rise cost of food __PUNCT__ gasolin __PUNCT__ and most everyth els __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ we need to get a handl on the cost of oil and gasolin __PUNCT__ and to regain energi independ for america __PUNCT__
in main __PUNCT__ eight out of ten home us heat oil __PUNCT__
and with the cost of that fuel approach __MONEY__ per gallon __PUNCT__ mani famili will have to spend a thousand dollar or more everi time thei fill their tank __PUNCT__ just to keep warm thi winter __PUNCT__
thi is just on exampl of the troubl american face __PUNCT__
and for our trucker __PUNCT__ farmer __PUNCT__ and taxi driver __PUNCT__ the need for relief is just as great __PUNCT__
yet even now __PUNCT__ with the price of gasolin at four dollar or more per gallon __PUNCT__ the congress ha done exactli noth to suspend the feder ga tax __PUNCT__
incred __PUNCT__ some in congress ar actual in favor of rais the ga tax by anoth ten cent per gallon __PUNCT__
and senat obama ha propos a windfal profit tax on oil that could simpli be pass on to consum __PUNCT__ rais price at the pump even more __PUNCT__
my energi plan will save american monei at the pump in the best possibl wai __PUNCT__ by not take it awai in the first place __PUNCT__
we also need to act right now to increas america own energi product __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ the presid final lift the execut ban on offshor oil and ga explor __PUNCT__ and call on congress to lift it ban as well __PUNCT__
the congress now ha the sole power to lift the ban __PUNCT__ but so far thei just can't be bother to get around to it __PUNCT__
lift that ban would serious lower the price of oil __PUNCT__ and congress should get it done immedi __PUNCT__
as a matter of fair to the american peopl __PUNCT__ we need to drill more __PUNCT__ drill now __PUNCT__ and pai less at the pump __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ we will also make us of america vast coal reserv __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will commit thi nation to a concert effort to make clean coal a realiti and creat job in hard __PUNCT__ press region __PUNCT__
and america will pursu the goal of build __NUM__ nuclear power plant befor __NUM__ __PUNCT__
senat obama is not a propon of nuclear power __PUNCT__
but i wonder if he notic while he wa in franc that thei draw __NUM__ percent of their electr from nuclear energi __PUNCT__
and nation from europ to asia ar expand their us of thi clean __PUNCT__ proven __PUNCT__ and stabl sourc of energi __PUNCT__
regain control over the cost and suppli of energi in america will not be easi __PUNCT__ and it will not happen quickli __PUNCT__
but no challeng to our economi and secur is more urgent __PUNCT__
and you have my pledg that if i am presid __PUNCT__ we go to get it done __PUNCT__
