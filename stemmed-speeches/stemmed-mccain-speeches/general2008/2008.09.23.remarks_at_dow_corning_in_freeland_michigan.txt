america todai face an histor nation crisi __PUNCT__
the global economi is directli threaten by the potenti collaps of our financi system __PUNCT__
two year ago __PUNCT__ i warn the american peopl about the lack of oversight __PUNCT__ transpar __PUNCT__ backroom deal and financi reckless at freddi mac and fanni mae __PUNCT__
those warn went unheed __PUNCT__ and more than anyth directli contribut to the subprim mortgag crisi which ha creat the perfect econom storm __PUNCT__
further inact is simpli not an option __PUNCT__
we must pass legisl to address thi crisi __PUNCT__
if we do not __PUNCT__ credit will dry up __PUNCT__ with devast consequ for our economi __PUNCT__
peopl will no longer be abl to bui home and their life save will be at stake __PUNCT__
busi will not have enough monei to pai their employe __PUNCT__
but let us be perfectli clear __PUNCT__ a great burden is upon the american peopl __PUNCT__
seven hundr billion dollar is a stagger and unpreced figur __PUNCT__ and it is import that i speak plainli to the american peopl about the dimens of thi propos __PUNCT__
in essenc __PUNCT__ what thi plan requir is a ten thousand dollar contribut per household __PUNCT__
seven hundr billion dollar __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ could rebuild the crumbl infrastructur in everi town __PUNCT__ counti __PUNCT__ and state in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus what is be ask of the american peopl is unpreced __PUNCT__ great care must be taken to ensur their protect __PUNCT__
with the taxpay in mind __PUNCT__ i am seek __NUM__ basic improv to thi legisl __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ there must be greater account includ in the bill __PUNCT__
i have suggest a bipartisan board to provid oversight for the rescu __PUNCT__
we will not solv a problem caus by poor oversight with a plan that ha no oversight __PUNCT__
never befor in the histori of our nation ha so much power and monei been concentr in the hand of on person __PUNCT__ and there must be protect and oversight in place __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ as a part of that oversight __PUNCT__ there must be a path for taxpay to recov the monei that is put into thi fund __PUNCT__
on trillion dollar is an unpreced sum __PUNCT__
we ar talk about ten thousand dollar per household __PUNCT__ and that monei cannot simpli go into a black hole of bad debt with no mean of recov ani of the fund __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ there must be complet transpar in the review of thi legisl and in the implement of ani legisl __PUNCT__
thi cannot be cobbl togeth behind close door __PUNCT__
the american peopl have the right to know which busi will be help __PUNCT__ what that select will be base on and how much that help will cost __PUNCT__
all the detail should all be made avail onlin and elsewher for open public scrutini __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ no wall street execut should profit from taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
it is wrong to ask teacher and farmer and small busi owner to fill the ga tank of the helicopt of wall street tycoon __PUNCT__
the senior leader of ani firm that is bail out should not be make more than the highest paid govern offici __PUNCT__
fifth and final __PUNCT__ it is complet unaccept for ani kind of earmark to be includ in thi bill __PUNCT__
it would be outrag for legisl and lobbyist to pack thi rescu plan with taxpay monei for favor compani __PUNCT__
thi simpli cannot happen __PUNCT__
let me restat that inact is not an option __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar watch __PUNCT__
histori will be our judg __PUNCT__ and it will judg us harshli if we do not put our countri first in thi crisi __PUNCT__
