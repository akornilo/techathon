mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but you did it indirectli __PUNCT__ so let me ask you for some straight talk __PUNCT__
do you think that senat obama is a socialist __PUNCT__ do you think that hi plan ar social __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think hi plan ar redistribut of the wealth __PUNCT__
he said it himself __PUNCT__ we need to spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that on of __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ is that social __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ that on of the tenet of social __PUNCT__
but it more the liber left __PUNCT__ which he alwai been on __PUNCT__
he alwai been in the left lane of american polit __PUNCT__
that why he vote __NUM__ time against ani tax cut or for tax increas __PUNCT__
that why he vote for the democrat resolut __PUNCT__ budget resolut __PUNCT__ that would impos tax on __PUNCT__ rais tax on some individu who make __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
that why he ha the most liber vote record in the unit state senat __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ when we talk __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ so is on of the tenet of social redistribut of the wealth __PUNCT__ not just social __PUNCT__ a lot of other liber and left wing philosophi __PUNCT__ redistribut of the wealth __PUNCT__ i don't believ in it __PUNCT__
i believ in wealth creation by joe the plumber __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ you vote for the __MONEY__ billion bailout that be us partial to nation american bank __PUNCT__
isn't that social __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ that is react to a crisi that due to greed and excess in washington __PUNCT__
and what thi administr is do wrong __PUNCT__ and what paulson is do wrong __PUNCT__ is not go out and bui up home loan mortgag __PUNCT__ home mortgag __PUNCT__ and give peopl new mortgag at the new valu of their home so thei can stai in their home __PUNCT__
thei bail out the bank __PUNCT__
thei bale out these institut __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but you vote for that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
it wa a packag that had to be enact becaus the economi wa about to go into the tank __PUNCT__
dure the __PUNCT__ dure the depress __PUNCT__ we had a program to take care __PUNCT__ where thei went out and bought homeown __PUNCT__ mortgag __PUNCT__ and then over time thei even made monei as the valu of home began to increas __PUNCT__
if we don't turn __PUNCT__ the hous market wa the catalyst __PUNCT__ the greed and excess __PUNCT__ and fanni mae and freddi __PUNCT__ which some of us propos legisl to rein in __PUNCT__ the democrat were in charg of congress for most six __PUNCT__ for the last coupl of year __PUNCT__ and thei did not act __PUNCT__ and so __PUNCT__ and senat obama did not act __PUNCT__
but the point is that __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ when a __PUNCT__ when a __PUNCT__ that the reason why we have govern __PUNCT__ to help those who need help __PUNCT__ who can't help themselv __PUNCT__ and when time of crisi to step in and do what necessari to preserv the live and futur of innoc peopl __PUNCT__
it wasn't main street america that caus thi __PUNCT__

the fact that senat obama would not repudi that statement __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ is someth the american peopl will make a judgment about __PUNCT__
that robo call is accur __PUNCT__ is total accur __PUNCT__
and there is no comparison between it and the thing that were done and said in south carolina __PUNCT__

mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but when we come back __PUNCT__ we talk issu __PUNCT__ we talk process __PUNCT__ we talk sarah palin and what america will look like under presid obama or presid mccain __PUNCT__
back from ohio in just a moment __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ wallac __PUNCT__ and we back now on the campaign trail in the battleground state of ohio with our exclus guest __PUNCT__ senat john mccain __PUNCT__
senat __PUNCT__ on anoth sundai talk show __PUNCT__ gener colin powel ha just said that he go to vote for barack obama __PUNCT__
he sai he meet the standard of be a success presid __PUNCT__
he sai that senat mccain is unsur about how to deal with the economi __PUNCT__ and he doe not feel that sarah palin is readi to be command in chief __PUNCT__
your reaction __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i alwai admir and respect gener powel __PUNCT__
we longtim friend __PUNCT__
thi doesn't come as a surpris __PUNCT__
but i also veri pleas to have the endors of four former secretari of state __PUNCT__ secretari kissing __PUNCT__ baker __PUNCT__ eagleburg and haig __PUNCT__
and i proud to have the endors of well over __NUM__ retir armi gener and admir __PUNCT__
but i respect and continu to respect and admir secretari powel __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ just briefli __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ on of the kei line of your campaign ha been that obama not readi to lead __PUNCT__
here is colin powel sai he is __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ we have a veri __PUNCT__ we have a respect disagr __PUNCT__ and i think the american peopl will pai close attent to our messag for the futur and keep america secur __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ if barack obama is elect presid with bigger __PUNCT__ and it look like that that what go to happen __PUNCT__ democrat major in the hous and the senat __PUNCT__ how will thing be differ in thi countri by the end of hi first term __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we know that the major leader __PUNCT__ harri reid __PUNCT__ and speaker nanci pelosi __PUNCT__ ar alreadi plan on new big spend packag __PUNCT__ tax increas __PUNCT__ alreadi __PUNCT__ so i __PUNCT__ i think you see anoth spend spree __PUNCT__ and i think tax will go up __PUNCT__ and i don't think that it will be good for america __PUNCT__
i think we could drive __PUNCT__ and of cours __PUNCT__ as we know __PUNCT__ protection is not good for america __PUNCT__
senat obama believ that in mani wai __PUNCT__ certainli __PUNCT__ when he said he want to unilater renegoti the north american free trade agreement __PUNCT__
so i worri about the economi of the countri __PUNCT__ particularli at thi difficult time __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ you sai that obama tax plan amount to welfar becaus he give refund tax credit __PUNCT__ in effect __PUNCT__ check __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ percent of american who don't pai ani incom tax __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ feder incom tax __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ obama point out that no on will receiv on of these refund check if thei aren't at least pai payrol tax __PUNCT__ social secur tax __PUNCT__
and your health care plan would also give these refund check to that same __NUM__ percent who don't pai incom tax __PUNCT__ feder incom tax __PUNCT__
so if hi plan is welfar __PUNCT__ isn't your __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ the differ is that we need to provid __PUNCT__ it a fundament requir to give peopl the chanc to have afford and avail health insur __PUNCT__ or the option is to go into a big govern program such as we have in canada __PUNCT__ in england and other __PUNCT__
american right now ar without health insur __PUNCT__
thei need to get it __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ let talk about the first __NUM__ dai of a mccain presid __PUNCT__
you sai that it would not be polit as usual in washington __PUNCT__
be specif __PUNCT__
what would you do in that first __NUM__ dai to show there a differ sheriff in town __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ reach out to republican and democrat alik __PUNCT__ make sure that everybodi includ in ani plan and program __PUNCT__ and obvious get our economi back on track is the __PUNCT__ is the prime and first and __PUNCT__ through tenth challeng we have __PUNCT__ sit down across the aisl __PUNCT__ outlin an agenda that we can work togeth on __PUNCT__

mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ and you call it a far left agenda __PUNCT__
i think you agre the democrat ar like to increas their hold in both the hous and senat __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ afraid you mai be right __PUNCT__
thei ar __PUNCT__ the democrat had a major in the hous and senat when ronald reagan came to offic in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but given how difficult __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ he sat down with democrat and republican togeth __PUNCT__ and thei work togeth __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but given how difficult __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and we turn the american economi around rather dramat __PUNCT__ but it took time __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but given how differ your agenda ar on the economi __PUNCT__ on health care __PUNCT__ on tax __PUNCT__ on foreign polici __PUNCT__ wouldn't there just be more gridlock __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ ronald reagan agenda wa veri differ from that of tip o'neil __PUNCT__
