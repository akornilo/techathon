thank you for that kind welcom __PUNCT__ and for the hospit of youngstown state univers __PUNCT__
i appreci thi chanc to share my view and to hear your __PUNCT__
it a big new dai in polit __PUNCT__ with the pennsylvania primari and all __PUNCT__
and i been left recent in the unfamiliar posit of face no opposit within my own parti __PUNCT__
as you might recal __PUNCT__ it wa a differ stori last year __PUNCT__ when i could claim the unqualifi support of cindi and my mother __PUNCT__ and mom wa start to keep her option open __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ there were some veri impress frontrunn __PUNCT__
there wa a veri formid second tier of contend __PUNCT__ and then there wa me __PUNCT__
as i recal __PUNCT__ a few pollster even declar my campaign a hopeless caus __PUNCT__ and there wa no margin of error to soften the blow __PUNCT__
but a person learn along the wai that if you hold on __PUNCT__ if you don't quit no matter what the odd __PUNCT__ sometim life will surpris you __PUNCT__
sometim you get a second chanc __PUNCT__ and opportun turn back your wai __PUNCT__
and when it doe __PUNCT__ we ar stronger and readier becaus of all that we had to overcom __PUNCT__
i bring up all thi becaus the men and women of youngstown know what it feel like to be count out __PUNCT__
you been written off a few time yourselv __PUNCT__ in the competit of the market __PUNCT__
you know how it feel to hear that good thing ar happen in the american economi __PUNCT__ thei just not happen to you __PUNCT__
we hear peopl talk a lot these dai about new industri on the rise and new skill in demand __PUNCT__
but thei not the industri you grew up with __PUNCT__ and thei not the skill mani worker have spent twenti or thirti year learn on the job __PUNCT__
peopl in the know like to discours about the new global economi __PUNCT__ it alwai __PUNCT__ global __PUNCT__ thi and __PUNCT__ global __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__
but sometim it seem that the map of the world thei ar us ha onli capit __PUNCT__ financi center __PUNCT__ and port citi __PUNCT__
and where ar the place like canton __PUNCT__ and lima __PUNCT__ and akron __PUNCT__ and youngstown __PUNCT__ where the heartland __PUNCT__ where men and women know how to make thing __PUNCT__ and how to do the job with pride __PUNCT__ the struggl of thi commun and other like it matter when we talk about our nation economi __PUNCT__ thei ar not just a problem __PUNCT__ thei a prioriti __PUNCT__
what matter most of all is that you didn't give up __PUNCT__
mani of you ar receiv train at youngstown state __PUNCT__ at a time in life when learn new thing doesn't come easi __PUNCT__
and when you finish your educ here __PUNCT__ it is not ask too much that the effort be reward with new job in new industri __PUNCT__
polit candid have a wai of pass through the mahon vallei and observ onli the seriou econom troubl here __PUNCT__ which ar hard to miss at place like the fabart fabric facil that i visit thi morn __PUNCT__
what thei often overlook ar the new compani and industri that ar struggl to grow here __PUNCT__ to find new market and hire new worker __PUNCT__
there ar new softwar and other tech compani in youngstown __PUNCT__
there ar startup compani in altern energi like wind and solar power __PUNCT__
there ar small busi in thi citi __PUNCT__ with good idea and plan for growth __PUNCT__
there a __PUNCT__ green space __PUNCT__ initi that chang the look and direct of youngstown __PUNCT__
as a local support of __PUNCT__ green space __PUNCT__ explain __PUNCT__ the plan is __PUNCT__ get us to think about where we go into the futur __PUNCT__ rather than where we been in the past __PUNCT__
these new idea and industri ar a long wai from match the import of the plant and factori that built the economi of thi region __PUNCT__
but thei ar base on a guid convict __PUNCT__ that the american midwest is more than a __PUNCT__ rust belt __PUNCT__ and it economi is more than the sum of past hardship __PUNCT__
and i believ thi __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as you know better than i do __PUNCT__ it won't happen overnight __PUNCT__
but dramat chang can happen __PUNCT__ in thi great citi and other like it __PUNCT__
with pro __PUNCT__ growth polici to creat new job __PUNCT__ and with honest and effici govern in washington __PUNCT__ we can turn thing around in thi citi __PUNCT__
and we can make the futur of thi region even better than the best dai of the past __PUNCT__
rais tax on busi in ohio and elsewher __PUNCT__ as both my oppon propos to do __PUNCT__ will not bring the old job back __PUNCT__ and it sure won't creat new on __PUNCT__
our govern alreadi impos the second __PUNCT__ highest tax rate in the world on manufactur and other industri __PUNCT__ and it drive busi and job oversea __PUNCT__
our foreign competitor wouldn't mind at all if we kept it that wai __PUNCT__ but chang is need and i go to lead it __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ we go to get rid of that drag on growth and job creation __PUNCT__ and help american worker compet with ani compani in the world __PUNCT__
the same goe for your own wage __PUNCT__ in the job you have now or the on you hope to have __PUNCT__
and we can start by doubl the tax exempt for everi depend child of everi worker in america __PUNCT__
the current exempt ha lost much of it valu becaus of inflat __PUNCT__
and besid __PUNCT__ in tough time work mother and father should not have to give awai more and more of their paycheck to the govern __PUNCT__
thei need to invest more in their own famili and their own futur __PUNCT__ and we should help them __PUNCT__
i have plan to make health care more portabl and afford with gener tax credit __PUNCT__
lose a job is hard enough without lose your health care __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
we need reform to make sure that employ spend more on wage __PUNCT__ and that your health plan is your to keep __PUNCT__
ohio ha the highest foreclosur rate in the countri __PUNCT__
mani here ar among the million of american who plai by the rule __PUNCT__ yet now fear lose their hous becaus of the reckless conduct of subprim lender __PUNCT__
i call for a depart of justic task forc to investig possibl crime by these lender __PUNCT__ so that thei answer for the conduct in a court of law __PUNCT__
and under the home plan i have propos __PUNCT__ our govern will offer direct and immedi help to respons sub __PUNCT__ prime borrow who plai by the rule __PUNCT__
if you can't make your payment __PUNCT__ and you in danger of foreclosur __PUNCT__ you will be abl to go to ani post offic and pick up a form for a new home loan __PUNCT__
in place of your flaw mortgag loan __PUNCT__ you be elig for a new __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year fix __PUNCT__ rate loan back by the unit state govern __PUNCT__
citizen will keep their home __PUNCT__ lender will cut their loss __PUNCT__ everyon will move on __PUNCT__
and lender will follow the sou nder practic that should have been observ in the first place __PUNCT__
reckless conduct and the abus of power must be call to account __PUNCT__ on wall street __PUNCT__ in washington __PUNCT__ or ani place els __PUNCT__
and i have a few idea about washington in particular __PUNCT__
my plan for reform start with a top __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ bottom review of the budget of everi depart and agenc __PUNCT__ to make sure that feder monei is go to essenti prioriti like job train __PUNCT__ the secur of our citizen __PUNCT__ and the care of our veteran __PUNCT__
we also go to put an end to the ten of billion of dollar squander everi year on special favor and corpor welfar __PUNCT__
at a time when mani work famili can hardli afford their mortgag __PUNCT__ their groceri __PUNCT__ and ga for the car or truck __PUNCT__ we need to close the door firmli on corpor lobbyist __PUNCT__
i have a reput of low toler for the wast __PUNCT__ abus __PUNCT__ and occasion corrupt wai of busi as usual in washington __PUNCT__
i hope i earn that reput __PUNCT__ becaus it is exactli the s pirit we need in the white hous __PUNCT__
so often in washington you come across peopl who expect favor or special treatment from govern __PUNCT__ and thei don't especi care how much it cost or who left out __PUNCT__
then you come to a place like youngstown __PUNCT__ and meet citizen with real need and real claim on the consider of their countri __PUNCT__
and mostli what thei want __PUNCT__ in the end __PUNCT__ is a good job in their own hometown __PUNCT__
a plant gate to walk through and a paycheck to count on __PUNCT__
there ar mani thing we can do to bring that dai closer for american out of work __PUNCT__
and on of the most essenti thing is what you do right here at youngstown state __PUNCT__
job train program like your set the standard in mani wai __PUNCT__ for give help when help is need __PUNCT__
but it a standard you won't find put into action everywher __PUNCT__
america system of unemploy insur and job train is realli not a system at all __PUNCT__ but instead a patchwork of old program date back to the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
find the good on can be a matter of luck __PUNCT__ and that shouldn't be the case when you lose a job and need some help __PUNCT__
hundr of thousand of worker enter thi system everi year __PUNCT__
everi on of them is entitl to expect the same benefit __PUNCT__
everi program should have the best servic __PUNCT__ the best benefit __PUNCT__ and the best train that our countri ha to offer __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ unemploy __PUNCT__ insur tax will be us to build a buffer account for each worker against a sudden loss of incom __PUNCT__
in time of need __PUNCT__ thei won't just be told to fill out form and take a number __PUNCT__ as often happen now __PUNCT__
and thei won't just be thrown into some on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit __PUNCT__ all program __PUNCT__ with arbitrari timet and futur plan decid for them by the govern __PUNCT__
american worker will have monei to fall back on when it matter most __PUNCT__
and it will be their own monei __PUNCT__ to keep their own health care __PUNCT__ and make their own decis about the road ahead __PUNCT__
in the new system __PUNCT__ our worker will be given option __PUNCT__ and train relev to need __PUNCT__ and at everi turn treat with the respect and consider thei deserv __PUNCT__
and we will draw on the great strength of america commun colleg __PUNCT__ appli the fund from feder train account to give displac worker of everi ag a fresh start with new skill and new opportun __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ we ar go to make unemploy insur what it suppos to be a solid guarante when time ar tough __PUNCT__ and swift path from a job that not come back to a job that won't go awai __PUNCT__
america is __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ the countri of the second chanc __PUNCT__ and we need to stai true to that creed __PUNCT__
i had a few extra chanc myself along the wai __PUNCT__
thei made all the differ __PUNCT__ and those opportun belong to everyon __PUNCT__
with that __PUNCT__ i thank you all for your kind attent __PUNCT__ and i welcom ani question you care to throw me __PUNCT__
like you __PUNCT__ i here to learn __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
