__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and reliev thi burden on american as well __PUNCT__
so i call it the lexington project __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__
and you can call it anyth you want __PUNCT__
but let have no doubt __PUNCT__ the nation secur __PUNCT__ the econom and the environment implic of thi mission we have to be on __PUNCT__
but i want to sai to you again __PUNCT__ we have face greater challeng __PUNCT__
i see gentlemen and women in thi room who have serv their countri in uniform __PUNCT__
and thei have face great challeng __PUNCT__ far more challeng perhap than ani of the rest of us did __PUNCT__
thei were abl to emerg victori and i sure that america can follow in their footstep and their exampl and be inspir by them __PUNCT__
would i ask our veteran just to rais their hand for me pleas __PUNCT__ so that i can sai thank you and thank you for serv our countri __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ now if i could address on more issu with you briefli __PUNCT__
and that is the issu __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ that thi ongo discuss we have now and debat we been have across america for a long time __PUNCT__ concern the war in iraq __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think you know that __PUNCT__ and i remind you __PUNCT__ that we won a veri easi initi victori __PUNCT__
and then we emploi a veri flaw and fail strategi that nearli fail and nearli lost us thi had whole conflict __PUNCT__
and it wa a veri bad strategi __PUNCT__
i knew that it wa a bad strategi __PUNCT__
i fought against it __PUNCT__ i argu against it __PUNCT__
and i wa call disloy by republican becaus i knew that that strategi wa fail and i knew the strategi that had to be emploi __PUNCT__
and thi nation final __PUNCT__ we switch that strategi and we found on of the greatest gener in american histori in gener david petraeu __PUNCT__ to lead us __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and the name of that strategi __PUNCT__ we call the cold surg __PUNCT__
it requir addit troop __PUNCT__
but it also requir an entir new approach to the wai we conduct what is basic a counter __PUNCT__ insurg __PUNCT__
we us to go into place and fight peopl and go back to a base __PUNCT__
and then thei would filter back in __PUNCT__
gener petraeu __PUNCT__ strategi is to go out into a neighborhood __PUNCT__ set up outpost __PUNCT__ stai __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__ establish a secur environ for the peopl so that the rest of their live could go continu in a more success wai __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ start to do busi __PUNCT__ send their kid to school __PUNCT__ all of the thing that go with a normal life __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ at first __PUNCT__ thei had to put back al __PUNCT__ qaeda and the variou jihadist group that were caus so much difficulti and chao in that countri __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ over time __PUNCT__ thi strategi succeed __PUNCT__
and there no doubt that it succeed __PUNCT__
it ha succeed __PUNCT__
and i happi to tell you that __PUNCT__
and we ar win thi conflict __PUNCT__
and the benefit of win thi conflict ar is that we will reduc the iranian influenc __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the iranian ar export into iraq __PUNCT__ the most lethal devic that ar kill brave __PUNCT__ young american __PUNCT__
have no doubt about that __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ it also would prevent al __PUNCT__ qaeda from establish anoth base there __PUNCT__
it would have had an incred impact in the region the unit state defeat in have lost and gone home __PUNCT__
and i knew all of that __PUNCT__ and that why i said at the time __PUNCT__
when peopl said __PUNCT__ you support __NUM__ more troop and a new strategi __PUNCT__ that your candidaci is doom to failur __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ i would rather lose a campaign than lose a war __PUNCT__
and i meant that then __PUNCT__ and i mean that now __PUNCT__ transcript end __PUNCT__
