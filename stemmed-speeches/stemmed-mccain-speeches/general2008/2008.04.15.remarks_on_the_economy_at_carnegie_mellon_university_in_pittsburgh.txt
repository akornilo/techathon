thi univers ha a fine reput for it program in busi __PUNCT__ financ __PUNCT__ and other disciplin in the field of econom __PUNCT__
and it alwai worth recal that econom is not a subject that can be wrench apart from all the rest of life __PUNCT__ or from the valu that give life direct __PUNCT__
when we debat econom polici __PUNCT__ we ar talk __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ about the deepest hope that carri us each along in the work we do __PUNCT__ about all the thing we wish for ourselv and for each other __PUNCT__
and these cannot be measur by simpli run the number __PUNCT__
in our free societi __PUNCT__ it is left to each on of us to make our own wai in the world __PUNCT__ and our job __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ save __PUNCT__ pension __PUNCT__ farm __PUNCT__ and home ar the work of year __PUNCT__
take these awai and you ar diminish a lot more than the gdp __PUNCT__ or the final talli on the big board on wall street __PUNCT__
take these awai __PUNCT__ and a million dream ar undon __PUNCT__
the gain of hard work and sacrific ar lost __PUNCT__
and someth can be lost that is veri crucial in our economi __PUNCT__ and veri slow to return __PUNCT__ confid __PUNCT__
everi so often in our nation capit __PUNCT__ we relearn thi lesson when the excess of trader and specul __PUNCT__ and the poor plan of politician __PUNCT__ catch up with them __PUNCT__ and the troubl spread far beyond wall street and washington __PUNCT__
thi ha happen in recent month __PUNCT__ at great cost to worker __PUNCT__ small busi __PUNCT__ famili __PUNCT__ and homeown across our nation __PUNCT__
and call these seriou problem a __PUNCT__ correct __PUNCT__ in the market __PUNCT__ or a __PUNCT__ cycl __PUNCT__ of the economi __PUNCT__ doesn't make their situat ani better __PUNCT__ their job and home ani safer __PUNCT__ their live ani easier __PUNCT__
econom polici is not just some academ exercis __PUNCT__ and we in washington ar not just passiv spectat __PUNCT__
we have a respons to act __PUNCT__ and if i am elect presid i intend to act quickli and decis __PUNCT__
we need reform that promot growth and opportun __PUNCT__
we need rule that assur fair and punish wrongdo in the market __PUNCT__
we need tax polici that respect the wage __PUNCT__ earner and job creator who make thi economi run __PUNCT__ and help them to succe in a global economi __PUNCT__
in all of thi __PUNCT__ it will not be enough to simpli dust off the econom polici of four __PUNCT__ eight __PUNCT__ or twenti __PUNCT__ eight year ago __PUNCT__
we have our own work to do __PUNCT__
we have our own challeng to meet __PUNCT__
million of work men and women in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ michigan and beyond can tell you how urgent is the work befor us __PUNCT__
on man put it thi wai to a report not long ago __PUNCT__ in repli to a question about the job he had just lost __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ i told my wife that i alwai keep a roof over her head __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i worri about keep that promis __PUNCT__
in the monthli report of our labor depart __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ american like thi man were let go recent and suddenli from job thei thought were safe __PUNCT__
a woman in the town of trainer __PUNCT__ in delawar counti __PUNCT__ also captur the feel of mani when she describ what it like to work and save for year __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ at the ag of __NUM__ still struggl for the basic of life __PUNCT__
the famili ha had medic problem __PUNCT__ and as she put it __PUNCT__ trust me __PUNCT__ no on want to be in our shoe __PUNCT__
and lot of peopl ar just a sick husband awai from where we ar __PUNCT__
for citizen like these __PUNCT__ do their best to keep promis and meet oblig __PUNCT__ there is no comfort know their problem ar common and their worri ar share __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ the peopl we expect to be most sober and level __PUNCT__ head in their econom decis __PUNCT__ banker and other home lender __PUNCT__ forgot some of the basic standard of their own profess __PUNCT__
hard __PUNCT__ work homeown ar learn for the first time about the endlessli complic borrow __PUNCT__ bundl __PUNCT__ and bet that ha been go on in our capit market __PUNCT__
american worri about a system that allow __NUM__ million bad loan to affect __NUM__ million good on __PUNCT__
thei wonder how asset can so quickli becom liabil __PUNCT__ and why the high __PUNCT__ risk scheme of a few were permit to inflict such grievou harm on our entir financi system __PUNCT__
american ar also right to be offend when the extravag salari and sever deal of ceo __PUNCT__ in some case __PUNCT__ the veri same ceo who help to bring on these market troubl __PUNCT__ bear no relat to the success of the compani or the wish of sharehold __PUNCT__
someth is serious wrong when the american peopl ar left to bear the consequ of reckless corpor conduct __PUNCT__ while mr __PUNCT__ cayn of bear stearn __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ mozilo of countrywid __PUNCT__ and other ar pack off with anoth forti __PUNCT__ or fifti million for the road __PUNCT__
i leav it for other to specul on the technic definit of a recess __PUNCT__
it all a littl besid the point __PUNCT__ if it your plant that close and your job that gone __PUNCT__ when you ar face foreclosur __PUNCT__ or back in debt after year of hard effort __PUNCT__ or hardli abl to bui food __PUNCT__ ga __PUNCT__ or heat for your home __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ the truest measur of prosper in america is the success and financi secur of those who earn wage and meet payrol in thi countri __PUNCT__
mani ar wait for their first home __PUNCT__
their first big break __PUNCT__
their first shot at financi secur __PUNCT__
and help them will be my first prioriti in set the econom polici of thi nation __PUNCT__
in so mani wai __PUNCT__ even now __PUNCT__ the worker and entrepreneur of america ar taken for grant by their govern __PUNCT__ while the lobbyist and special pleader ar seldom turn awai __PUNCT__
by the ten of billion of dollar __PUNCT__ our tax monei is routin squander by the congress on less than useless pork __PUNCT__ barrel project __PUNCT__ project have noth to do with the purpos of govern __PUNCT__ and everyth to do with the preserv of power __PUNCT__
in the same wai __PUNCT__ mani in congress think american ar under __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__
thei speak as if let you keep your own earn were an act of chariti __PUNCT__ and now thei have decid you had enough __PUNCT__
by allow mani of the current low tax rate to expir __PUNCT__ thei would impos __PUNCT__ overnight __PUNCT__ the singl largest tax increas sinc the second world war __PUNCT__
among support of a tax increas ar senat obama and clinton __PUNCT__
both promis big __PUNCT__ chang __PUNCT__
and a trillion dollar in new tax over the next decad would certainli fit that descript __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ thei would like you to think that onli the veri wealthi will pai more in tax __PUNCT__ but the realiti is quit differ __PUNCT__
under my oppon __PUNCT__ variou tax plan __PUNCT__ american of everi background would see their tax rise __PUNCT__ senior __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ small busi owner __PUNCT__ and just about everyon who ha even a modest invest in the market __PUNCT__
all these tax increas ar the fine print under the slogan of __PUNCT__ hope __PUNCT__ thei go to rais your tax by thousand of dollar per year __PUNCT__ and thei have the audac to hope you don't mind __PUNCT__
thei and other argu that the tax increas is necessari in part to financ social secur and medicar __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ thi claim onli serv to remind us of congress __PUNCT__ consist failur to repair both of these program even under the best of circumst __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ congress ha been bui time __PUNCT__ and leav the great challeng of entitl reform for other to deal with __PUNCT__
and now the two contend in the other parti have even propos enorm new feder commit befor the old commit have been kept __PUNCT__ trust that other __PUNCT__ somewher down the road __PUNCT__ will handl the financ and make all the number come out right __PUNCT__
but there will come a dai when the road dead __PUNCT__ end __PUNCT__ and the old excus seem even more hollow __PUNCT__
and it won't be the politician who bear the consequ __PUNCT__
it will be american worker and their children who ar left with worthless promis and trillion __PUNCT__ dollar debt __PUNCT__
we cannot let that happen __PUNCT__
and you have my pledg __PUNCT__ as presid i will work with everi member of congress __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ and independ __PUNCT__ who share my commit to reform and protect medicar and social secur __PUNCT__
in so mani wai __PUNCT__ we need to make a clean break from the worst excess of both polit parti __PUNCT__
for republican __PUNCT__ it start with reclaim our good name as the parti of spend restraint __PUNCT__
somewher along the wai __PUNCT__ too mani republican in congress becam indistinguish from the big __PUNCT__ spend democrat thei us to oppos __PUNCT__
the onli power of govern that could stop them wa the power of veto __PUNCT__ and it wa rare us __PUNCT__
if that author is entrust to me __PUNCT__ i will us the veto as need __PUNCT__ and as the founder intend __PUNCT__
i will veto everi bill with earmark __PUNCT__ until the congress stop send bill with earmark __PUNCT__
i will seek a constitution valid line __PUNCT__ item veto to end the practic onc and for all __PUNCT__
i will lead across __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ board reform in the feder tax code __PUNCT__ remov myriad corpor tax loophol that ar costli __PUNCT__ unfair __PUNCT__ and inconsist with a free __PUNCT__ market economi __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will also order a prompt and thorough review of the budget of everi feder program __PUNCT__ depart __PUNCT__ and agenc __PUNCT__
while that top to bottom review is underwai __PUNCT__ we will institut a on __PUNCT__ year paus in discretionari spend increas with the necessari exempt of militari spend and veteran benefit __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ discretionari spend __PUNCT__ is a term peopl throw around a lot in washington __PUNCT__ while actual discret is seldom exercis __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ everi program come with a built __PUNCT__ in assumpt that it should go on forev __PUNCT__ and it budget increas forev __PUNCT__
my administr will chang that wai of think __PUNCT__
i hold the agenc of the feder govern account for the monei thei spend __PUNCT__
i make sure the public help me __PUNCT__ and i provid feder agenc with the best execut leadership that can be found in america __PUNCT__
we go to make everi aspect of govern purchas and perform transpar __PUNCT__
inform on everi step of contract and grant will be post on the internet in plain and simpl english __PUNCT__
we go to post an agenc perform evalu as well __PUNCT__
we go to demand account __PUNCT__
we will make sure that feder spend serv the common interest __PUNCT__ that fail program ar not reward __PUNCT__ and that discretionari spend is go where it belong __PUNCT__ to essenti prioriti like job train __PUNCT__ the secur of our citizen __PUNCT__ and the care of our veteran __PUNCT__
in my administr there will be no more subsidi for special pleader __PUNCT__ no more corpor welfar __PUNCT__ no more throw around billion of dollar of the peopl monei on pet project __PUNCT__ while the peopl themselv ar struggl to afford their home __PUNCT__ groceri __PUNCT__ and ga __PUNCT__
we ar go to get our prioriti straight in washington __PUNCT__ a clean break from year of squander wealth and wast chanc __PUNCT__
i have a clear record of not ask for earmark for my state __PUNCT__
for their part __PUNCT__ senat obama and clinton have champion a long list of pork __PUNCT__ barrel project for their state __PUNCT__ like that all __PUNCT__ import woodstock museum that senat clinton expect american to pai for at the cost of a million dollar __PUNCT__
that kind of careless spend of tax dollar is not chang __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ it is busi as usual in washington __PUNCT__ and it all a part of the same wast and corrupt system that we need to end __PUNCT__
the goal of reform __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ is not mere to check wast and keep a tidi budget process __PUNCT__ although these ar import enough in themselv __PUNCT__
the great goal is to get the american economi run at full strength again __PUNCT__ creat the opportun american expect and the job american need __PUNCT__
and on veri direct wai to achiev that is by take the save from earmark __PUNCT__ program review __PUNCT__ and other budget reform __PUNCT__ on the order of __NUM__ billion dollar annual __PUNCT__ and us those save to lower the busi incom tax for everi employ that pai it __PUNCT__
so i will send to congress a propos to cut the tax these employ pai __PUNCT__ from a rate of __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
as it is __PUNCT__ we have the second __PUNCT__ highest tax on busi in the industri world __PUNCT__
high tax rate ar drive mani busi and job oversea __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ our foreign competitor wouldn't mind if we kept it that wai __PUNCT__
but if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ we go to get rid of that drag on growth and job creation __PUNCT__ and help american worker compet with ani compani in the world __PUNCT__
i will also send to the congress a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut __PUNCT__ a complet phase __PUNCT__ out of the altern minimum tax to save more than __NUM__ million middl __PUNCT__ class famili more than __NUM__ dollar everi year __PUNCT__
our tax law and those who enforc them should treat all citizen with respect __PUNCT__ whether thei ar marri or singl __PUNCT__
but mother and father bear special respons __PUNCT__ and the tax code must recogn thi __PUNCT__
inflat ha erod the valu of the exempt for depend __PUNCT__
i will send to congress a reform to increas the exempt __PUNCT__ with the goal of doubl it from __NUM__ dollar to __NUM__ dollar for everi depend __PUNCT__ in everi famili in america __PUNCT__
the tax law of america should also promot and reward innov __PUNCT__ becaus innov creat job __PUNCT__
tax law should not smother the ingenu of our peopl with needless regul and disincent __PUNCT__
so i will propos and sign into law a reform agenda to permit the first __PUNCT__ year expens of new equip and technolog __PUNCT__ to ban internet tax __PUNCT__ perman __PUNCT__ to ban new cell phone tax __PUNCT__ and to make the tax credit for r&d perman __PUNCT__ so that we never lose our competit edg __PUNCT__
it is not enough __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ to make littl fix here and there in the tax code __PUNCT__
what we need is a simpler __PUNCT__ a flatter __PUNCT__ and a fair tax code __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will propos an altern tax system __PUNCT__
when thi reform is enact __PUNCT__ all who wish to file under the current system could still do so __PUNCT__
and everyon els could choos a vastli less complic system with two tax rate and a gener standard deduct __PUNCT__
american do not resent pai their right share of tax __PUNCT__ what thei do resent is be subject to thousand of page of needless and often irrat rule and demand from the ir __PUNCT__
we know from experi that no seriou reform of the current tax code will come out of congress __PUNCT__ so now it is time to turn the decis over to the peopl __PUNCT__
we ar go to creat a new and simpler tax system __PUNCT__ and give the american peopl a choic __PUNCT__
better tax polici is just on part of a pro __PUNCT__ growth agenda that includ smarter regul and a leaner __PUNCT__ more focus govern __PUNCT__
among the mani benefit to america __PUNCT__ these reform will help to creat job __PUNCT__ improv the invest climat __PUNCT__ attract global investor __PUNCT__ and strengthen the dollar __PUNCT__
american also worri about stagnant wage __PUNCT__ which ar caus in part by the rise cost of health care __PUNCT__
each year employ pai more and more for insur __PUNCT__ leav less and less to pai their employe __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will propos and relentlessli advoc chang that will bring down health care cost __PUNCT__ make health care more afford and access __PUNCT__ help individu and famili bui their health insur with gener tax credit __PUNCT__ and enabl you to keep your insur when you chang job __PUNCT__
mani retir american face the terribl realiti of decid whether to bui food __PUNCT__ pai rent or bui their prescript __PUNCT__
and their govern should help them __PUNCT__
but when we ad the prescript drug benefit to medicar __PUNCT__ a new and costli entitl __PUNCT__ we includ mani peopl who ar more than capabl of purchas their own medicin without assist from taxpay who struggl to purchas their own __PUNCT__
peopl like bill gate and warren buffet don't need their prescript underwritten by taxpay __PUNCT__
those who can afford to bui their own prescript drug should be expect to do so __PUNCT__
thi reform alon will save billion of dollar that could be return to taxpay or put to better us __PUNCT__
there never been a problem american couldn't solv __PUNCT__
we ar the world leader __PUNCT__ and leader don't fear chang __PUNCT__ pine for the past and dread the futur __PUNCT__
we make the futur better than the past __PUNCT__
that is why i object when senat obama and clinton and other preach the fals virtu of econom isolation __PUNCT__
senat obama recent suggest that american ar protectionist becaus thei ar bitter about be left behind in the global economi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ what hi excus for embrac the fals promis of protection __PUNCT__ open new market for american good and servic is indispens to our futur prosper __PUNCT__
we can compet with anyon __PUNCT__
senat obama and clinton think we should hide behind wall __PUNCT__ buri our head and industri in the sand __PUNCT__ and hope we have enough left to live on while the world pass us by __PUNCT__
but that is not good polici and it is not good leadershi p __PUNCT__
and the short __PUNCT__ sighted of these polici can be seen todai in congress __PUNCT__ refus to vote on the colombian free trade agreement __PUNCT__
when new trade partner can sell in our market __PUNCT__ and american compani can sell in their __PUNCT__ the gain ar great and thei ar last __PUNCT__
the strength of the american economi offer a better life to everi societi we trade with __PUNCT__ and the good come back to us in mani wai __PUNCT__ in better job __PUNCT__ higher wage __PUNCT__ and lower price __PUNCT__
free trade can also give onc troubl and impoverish nation a stake in the world economi __PUNCT__ and in their relat with america __PUNCT__
in the case of colombia __PUNCT__ a friend and crucial democrat alli __PUNCT__ it stabil and econom vital ar more critic now __PUNCT__ as other in the region seek to turn latin america awai from democraci and awai from our countri __PUNCT__
trade serv all of these nation interest __PUNCT__ and the interest of the american economi as well __PUNCT__ and i call on the congress onc again to put thi vital agreement to an up or down vote __PUNCT__
i know that open market don't automat translat into a higher qualiti of life for everi singl american __PUNCT__
chang is hard __PUNCT__ and while most of us gain __PUNCT__ some industri __PUNCT__ compani and worker ar left to struggl with veri difficult choic __PUNCT__
and govern should help worker get the educ and train thei need __PUNCT__ for the new job that will be creat by new busi in thi new centuri __PUNCT__
right now we have more than a half __PUNCT__ dozen differ program that ar suppos to help displac worker __PUNCT__ and for those who ar not work at all __PUNCT__
we have an unemploy insur program straight out of the 1950 __PUNCT__
it wa design to assist worker through a few tough month dure an econom downturn until their old job came back __PUNCT__
that program ha no relev to the world we live in todai __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i work with congress and the state to make job train and unemploy insur what thei should be __PUNCT__ a swift path from a job that not come back to a job that won't go awai __PUNCT__
we will build a new system __PUNCT__ us the unemploy __PUNCT__ insur tax to build for each worker a buffer account against a sudden loss of incom __PUNCT__ so that in time of need thei not just told to fill out form and take a number __PUNCT__
and we will draw on the great strength of america commun colleg __PUNCT__ appli the fund from feder train account to give displac worker of everi ag a fresh start with new skill and new opportun __PUNCT__
these reform must wait on the next elect __PUNCT__ but to help our worker and our economi we must also act in the here and now __PUNCT__
and we must start with the subprim mortgag crisi __PUNCT__ with the hundr of thousand of citizen who plai by the rule __PUNCT__ yet now fear lose their hous __PUNCT__
under the home plan i have propos __PUNCT__ our govern will offer these american direct and immedi help that can make all the differ __PUNCT__ if you can't make your payment __PUNCT__ and you in danger of foreclosur __PUNCT__ you will be abl to go to ani post offic and pick up a form for a new home loan __PUNCT__
in place of your flaw mortgag loan __PUNCT__ you be elig for a new __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year fix __PUNCT__ rate loan back by the unit state govern __PUNCT__
citizen will keep their home __PUNCT__ lender will cut their loss __PUNCT__ and everyon will move on __PUNCT__ follow the sounder practic that should have been observ in the first place __PUNCT__
it import as well to rememb that the foolish risk __PUNCT__ take of lender __PUNCT__ invest bank __PUNCT__ and other that led to these troubl don't reflect our free market as it should be work __PUNCT__
in a free market __PUNCT__ there must be transpar __PUNCT__ account __PUNCT__ and person and corpor respons __PUNCT__
the hous crisi came about becaus these standard collaps __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i intend to restor them __PUNCT__
the grave problem in the hous market have been viral __PUNCT__ spread out to affect the credit and bui power of american even as the price of oil and ga is rise as never befor __PUNCT__
there ar larger problem underli the price of oil __PUNCT__ all of which i will address in my energi plan __PUNCT__ but in the short term there ar crucial measur we can take __PUNCT__
i propos that the feder govern suspend all tax on gasolin now paid by the american peopl __PUNCT__ from memori dai to labor dai of thi year __PUNCT__
the effect will be an immedi econom stimulu __PUNCT__ take a few dollar off the price of a tank of ga everi time a famili __PUNCT__ a farmer __PUNCT__ or trucker stop to fill up __PUNCT__
over the same period __PUNCT__ our govern should suspend the purchas of oil for the strateg petroleum reserv __PUNCT__ which ha also contribut to the rise price of oil __PUNCT__
thi measur __PUNCT__ combin with the summer __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ ga __PUNCT__ tax holidai __PUNCT__ will bring a time reduct in the price of gasolin __PUNCT__
and becaus the cost of ga affect the price of food __PUNCT__ packag __PUNCT__ and just about everyth els __PUNCT__ these immedi step will help to spread relief across the american economi __PUNCT__
by summer end __PUNCT__ moreov __PUNCT__ million of colleg student will be count on their student loan to come through __PUNCT__ and we need to make sure that happen __PUNCT__
these young american __PUNCT__ includ perhap some of you at cmu __PUNCT__ ar among the mani citizen whose abil to obtain a loan might be serious hurt by farawai problem not of their own make __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ i propos that the depart of educ work with the governor to make sure that each state guarante agenc ha the mean and manpow to meet it oblig as a lender __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ last __PUNCT__ resort for student loan __PUNCT__
in the year ahead __PUNCT__ these young american will be need to sustain america primaci in the global marketplac __PUNCT__
and thei should not be deni an educ becaus the reckless of other ha made credit too hard to obtain __PUNCT__
these ar just some of the reform i intend to fight for and differ i will debat with whoever my democrat oppon is __PUNCT__
in the week and month ahead __PUNCT__ i will detail my plan to reform health care in america __PUNCT__ to make our school more account to parent and taxpay __PUNCT__ to keep america edg in technolog __PUNCT__ to us the power of free market to grow our economi __PUNCT__ to escap our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ and to guard against climat chang and to be better steward of the earth __PUNCT__
all of these challeng __PUNCT__ and more __PUNCT__ will face the next presid __PUNCT__ and i will not leav them for some unlucki gener of leader to deal with __PUNCT__
we ar go to restor the confid of the american peopl in the futur of thi great and bless countri __PUNCT__
i do not seek the presid on the presumpt that i am bless with such person great that histori ha anoint me to save my countri in it hour of need __PUNCT__
i seek the presid with the humil of a man who cannot forget that my countri save me __PUNCT__
i am run to serv america __PUNCT__ and to champion the idea i believ will help us do what everi american gener ha done __PUNCT__ to make in our time __PUNCT__ and from our challeng __PUNCT__ a safer __PUNCT__ stronger __PUNCT__ more prosper countri and a better world __PUNCT__
as i have alwai done __PUNCT__ i will make my case to everi american who will listen __PUNCT__
i will not confin myself to the comfort of speak onli to those who agre with me __PUNCT__
i will make my case to all the peopl __PUNCT__
i will listen to those who disagre __PUNCT__
i will try to persuad them __PUNCT__
i will debat __PUNCT__
and i will learn from them __PUNCT__
but i will fight everi moment of everi dai for what i believ is right for thi countri __PUNCT__ and i will not yield __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
