let take a look __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin videotap __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ you just came off your debat last night __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ and you just came off your debat last thursdai __PUNCT__
do you critiqu each other __PUNCT__ do you give each other advic __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ the onli advic we give each other is to have fun __PUNCT__ two word __PUNCT__ and we talk befor the debat __PUNCT__ and just have fun __PUNCT__ and it wa obviou that certainli sarah wa have fun at her debat __PUNCT__ and i wa try to have fun at mine __PUNCT__ and i think we did __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ but you did __PUNCT__ you did have fun __PUNCT__
and you had __PUNCT__ wa there a moment mayb befor the debat where you were nervou __PUNCT__ you begin to feel the pressur __PUNCT__ it end up be __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ __NUM__ some __PUNCT__ odd million peopl __PUNCT__
we don't know the number from last night watch the debat __PUNCT__
is that roll through your head or you just focus on what the mission is __PUNCT__ palin __PUNCT__ just focus on the mission __PUNCT__
and it wa help though that you call me right beforehand __PUNCT__ and he said those two word __PUNCT__ you said __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ have fun __PUNCT__
palin __PUNCT__ have fun __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ no pressur __PUNCT__
but while i have you both togeth __PUNCT__ i want to talk about __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ we discuss that you two had discuss the role that governor palin would plai in the mccain administr __PUNCT__
between the two of you __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ let start with you __PUNCT__ tell us what do you envis for the governor __PUNCT__ as her role __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all she probabl on of the foremost expert in thi nation on energi issu __PUNCT__
she wa respons for __PUNCT__ to make a long stori short __PUNCT__ a pipelin __PUNCT__ the __MONEY__ billion pipelin bring natur ga from alaska down to the lower __NUM__ __PUNCT__
she ha been involv in these issu of energi in mani uniqu wai __PUNCT__ includ be on the board that oversight __PUNCT__ sic __PUNCT__ the natur ga and oil resourc __PUNCT__ and other resourc in the state of alaska __PUNCT__
and so i think that there nobodi more qualifi to take on our mission of becom energi independ __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ she ha been a great reform __PUNCT__
i still don't think a lot of american appreci what it like for a republican to take on an incumb sit governor of your own parti __PUNCT__
it almost never happen __PUNCT__
thei wait until thei retir or whatev it is __PUNCT__ so it clear that she got a great record of reform __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ you know those special need famili __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ when you __PUNCT__ after a debat you alwai kind of wish you had said someth __PUNCT__
and on thing that i want to sai wa that __PUNCT__ in our town hall meet we have lot of famili show up with children that have autism __PUNCT__ and other special need famili __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ sarah palin want to take on that task of help reliev the burden __PUNCT__ find what caus autism __PUNCT__ find a cure for it __PUNCT__
and so i think that those respons __PUNCT__ not onli would i like for her to do __PUNCT__ but she uniqu qualifi to do __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ and on top of all the other respons of be vice presid __PUNCT__ and that mean nation secur __PUNCT__ and all the other issu __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ can i just interrupt on second __PUNCT__ energi is __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ you can do whatev you want __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ energi is nation secur __PUNCT__
secur __PUNCT__ nation secur is energi __PUNCT__
if we don't becom independ of foreign oil we go to have greater nation secur challeng __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ mayb then i can have you two debat among yourselv on thi on point __PUNCT__
becaus governor palin you have said that you try __PUNCT__ you work on senat mccain on the issu of anwr __PUNCT__
and you said you haven't had success yet __PUNCT__ but you still try __PUNCT__
palin __PUNCT__ the import thing to rememb __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ is that we on the same page in understand that it ha to be an all of the abov approach in deal with the energi crisi that we ar in __PUNCT__
it got to be the altern sourc of energi __PUNCT__ get plug into the solut here __PUNCT__
certainli __PUNCT__ the domest suppli of convent sourc also be tap into __PUNCT__ and then we got to remind american that an effort ha got to be even greater todai toward conserv becaus these finit resourc that we deal with obvious __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ onc oil is gone it gone __PUNCT__ onc the ga is gone __PUNCT__ it gone __PUNCT__
and we __PUNCT__ i think our nation ha realli becom kind of spoil in that arena __PUNCT__
so it an all of the abov approach that he embrac __PUNCT__ and that good __PUNCT__
that will lead us to that energi independ __PUNCT__ as oppos to the other ticket where thei have said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ to everi domest solut that ha been propos __PUNCT__
and that wa kind of perplex last night listen to barack obama posit __PUNCT__ all of a sudden __PUNCT__ sai that we need clean coal and perhap we need to offshor __PUNCT__ he so on record as have oppos __PUNCT__ and senat biden also __PUNCT__ have oppos those __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i think last night __PUNCT__ come awai from your debat __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ on of the thing that i got out of it wa __PUNCT__ i think barack obama is drill for vote __PUNCT__
i don't think that he too keen on drill for those sourc of energi that we need __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you had point out about governor biden __PUNCT__ sic __PUNCT__ had onc said __PUNCT__ the us of word __PUNCT__ rape __PUNCT__ the outer continent shell __PUNCT__
palin __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__

you visit the french __PUNCT__ the british __PUNCT__ the japanes __PUNCT__ thei all reprocess spent nuclear fuel __PUNCT__
but senat obama ha done __PUNCT__ he veri good with word __PUNCT__
he veri eloqu __PUNCT__
but when you look past it __PUNCT__ he ha oppos offshor drill and he ha oppos nuclear power __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ on of the thing i wa try to stress in the campaign and in the debat last night __PUNCT__ look at the gap between hi rhetor and hi record __PUNCT__
the most liber senat in the unit state senat __PUNCT__ that why i urg the peopl watch last night __PUNCT__ go to these web site __PUNCT__ the nation taxpay union __PUNCT__ citizen against govern wast __PUNCT__ and these other watchdog organ __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ thi mai sound a bit gratuit __PUNCT__ but at least becaus senat __PUNCT__ governor palin __PUNCT__ sarah palin is so persuas __PUNCT__ i would like to come to alaska __PUNCT__ i haven't been there in mani year anywai __PUNCT__ and mayb i agre to go visit that area and have a look __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ crosstalk __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ ar you go to take him moos hunt __PUNCT__ palin __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ let do that __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ while we at it __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ would you do that __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ have some fish __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ but moos hunt is fine __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ colm __PUNCT__ come up __PUNCT__ doe john mccain think barack obama ha the experi to lead thi countri __PUNCT__ sean press him on that and found out why it not obama experi that mccain is worri about __PUNCT__
more of sean exclus sit __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__
and newt gingrich come up with a reaction on hanniti __PUNCT__ colm __PUNCT__
announc __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ colm is brought to you by __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ colm __PUNCT__ we now continu with sean exclus sit __PUNCT__ down with senat john mccain and governor sarah palin __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin videotap __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ thi came up last night and thi came up in your debat here __PUNCT__
you us the line last night __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ wa interestingli __PUNCT__ wa a line that senat biden us about senat obama back when thei were debat __PUNCT__
and that is the presid doe not lend itself to on __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ job train __PUNCT__
and that rais the question __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ becaus it seem to me a narr ha emerg __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the same line that were us in the first debat by senat obama were us by joe biden in the second debat __PUNCT__ were us by senat obama in the third debat __PUNCT__
do you realli believ that senat obama is prepar to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ doe he have the experi __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__
but i let the american peopl make a judgment in just __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
but i think he lack the experi and the knowledg __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ the judgment that he ha displai __PUNCT__
the judgment that he displai over hi comment when russia commit aggress against georgia __PUNCT__ and hi failur __PUNCT__ as i mention last night __PUNCT__ to acknowledg that he wa wrong about the surg __PUNCT__
he is __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ doe not have the judgment necessari to lead thi countri in veri difficult time __PUNCT__
and hi record is replet with those misjudg __PUNCT__ whether it be hi comment about __PUNCT__ in afghanistan __PUNCT__ all american ar do is bomb villag and kill innoc civilian __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ exactli __PUNCT__ the exact quot is __PUNCT__ air __PUNCT__ raid villag and kill civilian __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ air __PUNCT__ raid villag __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ that so insult to the men and women who ar serv in the militari __PUNCT__
i think that he should at least retract that statement __PUNCT__
but i think the import thing is hi world view __PUNCT__ hi willing to sit down with ahmadinejad without precondit __PUNCT__ or hugo chavez __PUNCT__ or the castro brother __PUNCT__ without precondit __PUNCT__ give them legitimaci __PUNCT__ affirm their behavior and attitud toward their own peopl as well as toward us __PUNCT__
it show a lack of knowledg and experi __PUNCT__ and therefor __PUNCT__ judgment __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ governor palin __PUNCT__ you had echo those comment in recent dai __PUNCT__ thi wa immedi after the debat __PUNCT__
and you actual is __PUNCT__ the phrase that senat mccain just mention __PUNCT__ air __PUNCT__ raid villag and kill civilian __PUNCT__ you said that that should disqualifi him __PUNCT__ mean barack obama __PUNCT__ from be command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__
palin __PUNCT__ becaus there is such a gross misunderstand of what our u. __PUNCT__ troop ar do in afghanistan __PUNCT__
what thei do __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is fight terror and protect us __PUNCT__ protect our countri __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ thei build school for the children in afghanistan so that there is hope and opportun there __PUNCT__
so that just __PUNCT__ that gross misunderstand of what the unit state militari mission is right now is veri __PUNCT__ veri concern __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ could i mention on other __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__
point on hi record __PUNCT__ senat obama said that he would never vote to cut off the fund for american troop in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
after promis that __PUNCT__ he and a hand of other vote that wai __PUNCT__
now both he and senat biden said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it the same vote that i cast __PUNCT__
i cast a vote against withdraw and surrend __PUNCT__
and i had promis that i would do everyth that i could to fight against ani resolut that would entail withdraw __PUNCT__ set date for withdraw and therefor defeat in iraq __PUNCT__
so thei vastli differ vote __PUNCT__ thei vastli differ __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ and senat biden had actual critic him and said if you vote to cut off the fund __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and said he took a polit vote __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he said live would be lost __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
and ha also said that senat obama took a __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ polit vote __PUNCT__
i agre with senat biden __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ on of the thing that keep come up is the economi __PUNCT__ the economi __PUNCT__
and mayb both of you can answer thi question becaus it came up in your two debat and your on debat __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of the american peopl ar not go to see their tax go up __PUNCT__
you spent a lot of time in your debat deal with that __PUNCT__
you spent a lot of time in your debat deal with that __PUNCT__
is that honest __PUNCT__ is that truth __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ it not truth in the respect that __NUM__ percent or __NUM__ percent of the american peopl __PUNCT__ of taxpay __PUNCT__ american citizen don't pai tax __PUNCT__ feder incom tax __PUNCT__
so right there __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ is wrong __PUNCT__
and mayb that mean that he just want to give them a check __PUNCT__
but i don't know if you could interpret that as a __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__
but more importantli __PUNCT__ senat obama didn't tell __PUNCT__ nor did he deni last night __PUNCT__ that hi plan rais tax on small busi incom __PUNCT__
small busi creat __NUM__ job __PUNCT__ thousand job last year __PUNCT__
we lost at thi __PUNCT__ so far thi year __PUNCT__ we lost __NUM__ and some job __PUNCT__
small busi ha creat some __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
eighti __PUNCT__ four percent of employe __PUNCT__ worker in america ar emploi by small busi __PUNCT__
and he want to tax __NUM__ percent of small busi incom __PUNCT__
that kill job __PUNCT__
that keep peopl from hire __PUNCT__
so with senat obama rhetor __PUNCT__ you alwai have to __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ look at the rhetor __PUNCT__ and two __PUNCT__ look at the fine print __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ do you think that __PUNCT__ and i ask you __PUNCT__ governor palin __PUNCT__ thi __PUNCT__ do you think __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ both of you have brought up the fact in two of the debat that he keep sai __PUNCT__ you have made a point __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__ you rais tax __NUM__ time __PUNCT__ you had onli been in the senat a short period of time __PUNCT__ and you vote to rais tax on peopl make __MONEY__ a year and now you sai that __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ that not go to happen for __NUM__ percent of the peopl __PUNCT__
so is thi just someth __PUNCT__ is thi a misnom __PUNCT__ is thi __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ campaign rhetor __PUNCT__ is he be dishonest __PUNCT__ just not truth with the american peopl __PUNCT__ palin __PUNCT__ voter have got to go to someon record and see what thei have proven alreadi in term of what thei capabl of do in the futur __PUNCT__ __NUM__ time be on the wrong side of the american peopl in vote for higher tax __PUNCT__
and then he propos to spend now nearli a trillion dollar in new govern growth __PUNCT__
he doesn't explain how he is go to get the monei to pai for that also __PUNCT__
and then two __PUNCT__ these three year in the senat __PUNCT__ that nearli __MONEY__ million a dai in hi own request of earmark for govern to spend it __PUNCT__
that somebodi record __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it shouldn't be controversi __PUNCT__ it shouldn't hurt anybodi feel or anyth els __PUNCT__
but these type of issu ar brought up as somebodi record __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that as oppos to john mccain record and my record where we have truli __PUNCT__ that track record that show the reform __PUNCT__ the desir to and the success in put govern back on the side of the peopl __PUNCT__ our small busi and our famili __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and on addit point __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ when he ran for the __PUNCT__ for the unit state senat __PUNCT__ he said he support a middl incom work famili tax cut __PUNCT__
he never introduc a singl piec of legisl to implement that __PUNCT__
and instead __PUNCT__ he vote __NUM__ time to either increas peopl tax __PUNCT__ or against tax cut and __PUNCT__ vote for a resolut which call for tax individu who make as low as __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ look at the record __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ now you brought up in your debat __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ that sinc the time you been in senat __PUNCT__ about __PUNCT__ i think you said a __MONEY__ million of pork a dai __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ roughli __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ roughli __PUNCT__
joe biden __PUNCT__ last year __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ i think it wa __MONEY__ million in pork barrel that he brought back to the state of delawar __PUNCT__
both of them were __PUNCT__ pretti much dismiss in sai that not that much monei __PUNCT__
is that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ the fascin thing is when he sai it onli __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it a lot more than that __PUNCT__
but __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ and anybodi but an insid the beltwai pork barrel would think it a lot of monei __PUNCT__
and you know the other thing that thei keep not talk about __PUNCT__ sean __PUNCT__ is the corrupt influenc __PUNCT__
now fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ we blew the whistl two year ago __PUNCT__ a bunch of us __PUNCT__
and fanni and freddi __PUNCT__ with campaign contribut to the same kind of system __PUNCT__ were basic gain and purchas influenc so that the democrat were fight back against ani real regul and bring under control what a lot of us said wa go to be a train wreck __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ and come up governor palin ha been hit obama hard on the campaign trail over hi ti to the unrepent terrorist bill ayer __PUNCT__

and you know not onli those terrorist activ that bill ayer wa involv in __PUNCT__ but the question need to be ask __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ when did barack obama know of hi activ __PUNCT__ we heard so mani conflict stori __PUNCT__ and flip __PUNCT__ flop answer about when he knew the gui __PUNCT__ did he realiz that he kick off hi polit career in the gui live room __PUNCT__ first it wa ye __PUNCT__ and then it wa no __PUNCT__
it come down to again __PUNCT__ judgment and truth and a candid charact __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi is what we know __PUNCT__
we know that he did kick off hi polit career in hi hous __PUNCT__
palin __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ the year wa __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we know thei sat on multipl board togeth __PUNCT__
we know thei given speech togeth __PUNCT__
we know there been sort of a back and forth financi __PUNCT__
ayer contribut to obama __PUNCT__ obama sort of work some monei back through them __PUNCT__
what question __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ would you like answer as it relat to thi relationship __PUNCT__ and do you think the american peopl should care about thi __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think thei should care about senat obama truth __PUNCT__
i don't care much about old terrorist and hi wife who ar still unrepent __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ she wa as much or more activ than mr __PUNCT__ ayer wa __PUNCT__
but the point is __PUNCT__ it not about them __PUNCT__
it about senat obama be candid and straight forward with the american peopl about their relationship __PUNCT__
he ha dismiss it by sai he wa just a gui in the neighborhood __PUNCT__
we know it much more than that __PUNCT__
let reveal all the detail of that relationship and then the american peopl can make a judgment __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ but here a question __PUNCT__ hi answer is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i hardli knew him __PUNCT__
i wa __NUM__ year old when he commit these __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ despic act __PUNCT__

mccain __PUNCT__ when he wa in hi live room __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ and wa in hi live room __PUNCT__
and i guess my question is __PUNCT__ should the american peopl be concern that he capabl in a post __PUNCT__ 9/11 world of fight terror __PUNCT__ when he is friend with an unrepent terrorist __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think that also part of the judgment the american peopl make __PUNCT__
but first __PUNCT__ i think we ought to have a full and complet examin of the relationship __PUNCT__
and then the american peopl can make a judgment __PUNCT__
and so far __PUNCT__ i think it veri clear that he wa a lot more than just a gui in the neighborhood __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ do you think thi need to be ask more in your next debat __PUNCT__ do you think it should have __PUNCT__ becaus a lot of us in the media wa sit back think __PUNCT__ becaus of the __PUNCT__ new york time __PUNCT__ and becaus of your comment __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ that thi is someth that need to be vet out __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i hope it vet out __PUNCT__ if it need to be vet out __PUNCT__
and i think the american peopl understand whether senat obama ha been truth and candid about hi entir relationship with mr __PUNCT__ ayer __PUNCT__ and with other veri frankli __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let talk about other __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ includ the acorn organ __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we got __PUNCT__ thi is now part of a larger narr that emerg __PUNCT__
and the obama campaign seem veri __PUNCT__ veri defens about thi __PUNCT__
thei don't want ani question __PUNCT__ how dare you ask __PUNCT__ thi is unfair __PUNCT__
but he friend with father pfleger __PUNCT__ a radic __PUNCT__ fairli radic figur in chicago __PUNCT__ toni rezko __PUNCT__ a convict slumlord __PUNCT__ we have in on case __PUNCT__
and we know that he spent __NUM__ year in the pew of reverend wright __PUNCT__ who ha said the most outrag thing __PUNCT__ includ g.d __PUNCT__ america and __PUNCT__ america chicken have come home to roost __PUNCT__ after 9/11 __PUNCT__
what doe that tell you __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ about senat obama and hi radic associ __PUNCT__ palin __PUNCT__ it goe right back again to the candid judgment and who he choos to associ himself with in the past __PUNCT__ perhap the present __PUNCT__

and we should __PUNCT__ american should be concern about it __PUNCT__
palin __PUNCT__ i concern about it __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ in what wai __PUNCT__ palin __PUNCT__ concern about it becaus __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ somebodi track record sai so much about who thei ar and where thei want to lead thi countri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ colm __PUNCT__ and come up __PUNCT__ more of sean exclus interview __PUNCT__
mccain and palin explain why thei happi and comfort to be the role of the underdog __PUNCT__
plu we get a reaction from former speaker of the hous newt gingrich __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ newsbreak __PUNCT__ colm __PUNCT__ we continu with sean exclus interview with senat john mccain and governor sarah palin __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin videotap __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ your life stori is you spent five __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half year in the hanoi hilton __PUNCT__
i think what i read __PUNCT__ almost everi bone in your bodi ha been broken __PUNCT__
and you been tortur __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ on of the reason you don't us the comput __PUNCT__ thei ran that ad __PUNCT__ is becaus of your war injuri __PUNCT__
and you cannot lift your arm abov your shoulder __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i can do better than that __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ but think of how thi war ha been politic through the prism of your experi in vietnam __PUNCT__
the leader in the senat __PUNCT__ harri reid __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__ the surg ha fail __PUNCT__ the war is lost __PUNCT__
dick durbin compar our troop to nazi __PUNCT__

there ar verbatim quot __PUNCT__
and barack obama said thei __PUNCT__ air __PUNCT__ raid villag and kill civilian __PUNCT__

what doe it mean __PUNCT__ how do you stop that if you elect presid and vice presid __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we show them __PUNCT__ we show them victori __PUNCT__
the american peopl understand what at stake here __PUNCT__
and the american peopl have reject that __PUNCT__
and a lot of voter will be make a judgment __PUNCT__
when the major leader of the senat declar the war lost __PUNCT__ then a legitim question is __PUNCT__ who won __PUNCT__ al qaeda __PUNCT__ who won __PUNCT__ so these comment have been reminisc in mani wai to some of the rhetor that wa us dure the vietnam war that harm our veteran so much __PUNCT__ and harm their abil to come all the wai home __PUNCT__
word matter __PUNCT__
word matter __PUNCT__
and when senat harri reid declar that the war is lost __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ our young american who ar over there put their live on the line __PUNCT__ it not right __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
last question __PUNCT__
