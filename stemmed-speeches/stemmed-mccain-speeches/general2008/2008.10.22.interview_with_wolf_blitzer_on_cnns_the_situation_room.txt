you seem to have __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ a differ approach __PUNCT__
he sens you didn't have a complet grasp of the econom crisi the american peopl ar go through right now __PUNCT__
i wonder if you like to respond to secretari powel __PUNCT__

i respect gen __PUNCT__ powel __PUNCT__ but i respectfulli disagre __PUNCT__
i especi disagre when he said the comment that he made about gov __PUNCT__ sarah __PUNCT__ palin __PUNCT__ the most popular governor in america __PUNCT__ a governor who know energi issu __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion pipelin reform __PUNCT__ took on the governor of her own parti __PUNCT__
and i hope that sometim gen __PUNCT__ powel will take time out of hi busi schedul to meet with her __PUNCT__
i know she be pleas to meet with him __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but on the econom issu __PUNCT__ hi critic wa that you were go back and forth on some of the specif issu __PUNCT__ and he didn't like that __PUNCT__
he thought that sen __PUNCT__ obama had a consist in hi approach __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ all i can do is laugh __PUNCT__
we been veri consist about cut spend __PUNCT__ cut tax and the fundament of our econom messag __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama been all over the place __PUNCT__ includ want to __PUNCT__ rais tax on onli the rich __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ a tax cut for __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ when __NUM__ percent of them pai no feder incom tax as it is __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ whatev it is he chang with __PUNCT__ look at the posit that he held on tax increas when he wa first run in the primari __PUNCT__ and look at them now __PUNCT__
thei vastli differ __PUNCT__
and the fundament differ __PUNCT__ and mayb secretari powel agre with him __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__ but to spread the wealth around is certainli not someth that i would ever do __PUNCT__ that i would ever do __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ do you agre with ben bernank __PUNCT__ the chairman of the feder reserv __PUNCT__ who said thi week __PUNCT__ he said that it now a good time for a second econom stimulu packag __PUNCT__ seem to join hand with nanci pelosi and harri reid __PUNCT__
is it a good time to do that __PUNCT__ to come up with anoth __MONEY__ billion stimulu packag __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i would be glad to look at anyth that could be help to our economi __PUNCT__
i respect ben bernank __PUNCT__
i sick and tire __PUNCT__ and the american peopl ar sick and tire of the pork barrel spend __PUNCT__
why don't we cancel the __MONEY__ billion in pork barrel project that we put in last year at a minimum and us some of that monei to help stimul the economi as well __PUNCT__ instead of bridg to nowher and projector and planetarium such as sen __PUNCT__ obama ask for __PUNCT__ he ask for nearli __MONEY__ billion in pork barrel project __PUNCT__
why don't we ask him to make sure that monei that wa given to pork barrel project back to help american famili __PUNCT__ and then i think that american would be more like to support such a thing __PUNCT__
approv rate of congress at __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
no wonder __PUNCT__
we got a __MONEY__ trillion debt to our kid __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion to china __PUNCT__
we don't want to continu that spend practic __PUNCT__ and american ar sick and tire of it __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but you vote for that __MONEY__ billion rescu plan __PUNCT__ or bailout plan __PUNCT__ even though it had anoth __MONEY__ billion or so in unrel expenditur __PUNCT__ some would call pork or earmark or whatev __PUNCT__
where doe the u. __PUNCT__ presid draw the line between veto that kind of spend bill or accept it becaus of the greater good that it also includ __PUNCT__ as you decid in the bailout __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i would have veto liter everi spend bill __PUNCT__ even those that i vote for __PUNCT__ if i were presid of the unit state and made them famou the wai ronald reagan did __PUNCT__
let have no doubt about thi situat __PUNCT__
we presid over the largest increas in the size of govern in the last eight year than ani time in histori __PUNCT__
so we can take a hatchet __PUNCT__ and we can take a scalpel __PUNCT__ and we can reduc the spend __PUNCT__
and we can start by veto the normal appropri bill __PUNCT__
we all know that we ar in a situat of sever financi crisi __PUNCT__
and the democrat shouldn't be proud of ad __MONEY__ billion in pork barrel spend __PUNCT__
thei should be embarrass __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but you vote for it __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i had to vote for it __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ when we were in a situat of huge financi crisi __PUNCT__
but we wouldn't be in the crisi we in if a coupl of thing hadn't happen __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion of debt __PUNCT__ dramat overspend __PUNCT__ increas the size of govern __PUNCT__ and democrat defend fanni and freddi in their outrag practic which put us into the ditch to start with __PUNCT__
the same peopl that ar for the rescu packag ar the same peopl that defend fanni and freddi __PUNCT__ and when some of us propos legisl to fix it __PUNCT__
and so we should have start long ago toward veto these bill __PUNCT__
when you ar in an extraordinari crisi __PUNCT__ obvious you have to take extraordinari measur __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
we ask some of our viewer to send us some question __PUNCT__ ireport __PUNCT__ as we call them __PUNCT__
we got on from steve urquhart of quinci __PUNCT__ massachusett __PUNCT__
he said he plan to vote for obama __PUNCT__ but he consid himself an independ __PUNCT__
let me read to you what he said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ don't you think it hypocrit for you to be accus sen __PUNCT__ obama of be a socialist when you also sign on to that __MONEY__ billion bailout of our financi system __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thank __PUNCT__ steve __PUNCT__
we all know that we ar in a sever financi crisi __PUNCT__
and the big mistak that the administr ha made now __PUNCT__ and the secretari of the treasuri __PUNCT__ is not go out and bui up these home loan mortgag that ar bad and give them back to the homeown at a mortgag rate thei can afford and stai in their home __PUNCT__
it wa the hous crisi that start thi __PUNCT__
it the hous valu that ar go to start get us out __PUNCT__
dure the depress __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ clinton suggest the homeownership loan corpor __PUNCT__ which we __PUNCT__ which wa an enact of the depress era __PUNCT__ and we end up have more monei go back to the treasuri __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we bail out the bank and other institut that were complicit in thi __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ extraordinari circumst requir extraordinari action __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus you do want to spend __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ but it the failur __PUNCT__ and if we had done what i want done and what i fought for __PUNCT__ for reform and transpar and fix fanni and freddi __PUNCT__ as i did __PUNCT__ we wouldn't have been in thi situat we in and i wouldn't have been face with the decis of whether to vote for it or not __PUNCT__
it never should have happen __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus you want to us __MONEY__ billion of that __MONEY__ billion to bui up what ar call these bad mortgag __PUNCT__ and then try to renegoti them at a reduc price __PUNCT__
is that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ not try to __PUNCT__
it exactli what we did dure the depress __PUNCT__
it not a new invent __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but is that too much feder govern involv in the free market system __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ of cours it is __PUNCT__
but we ar in an extraordinari crisi __PUNCT__
the homeown ar the innoc bystand in a drive __PUNCT__ by shoot by washington and wall street __PUNCT__ greed __PUNCT__ excess and corrupt __PUNCT__
so why shouldn't we help __PUNCT__ the first role of govern is to help peopl who ar in crisi or need __PUNCT__
that why we have govern __PUNCT__
but if we had not done what we did to set thi whole hous of card up __PUNCT__ we wouldn't be face with these situat we have todai __PUNCT__
i proud of my record of reform __PUNCT__ take on my own parti __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama ha never taken on hi parti on ani major issu __PUNCT__ and that just a matter of record __PUNCT__
and he the most liber senat and the biggest taxer and the biggest spender __PUNCT__
that not the wai out __PUNCT__
we have stark differ __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let talk about tax right now __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ it a kei issu __PUNCT__
among other thing __PUNCT__ you like to cut __PUNCT__ and correct me if i wrong __PUNCT__ the corpor tax rate from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
is that right __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
absolut __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus what he sai and what democrat __PUNCT__ a lot of democrat sai __PUNCT__ that would be a corpor bonanza for exxonmobil __PUNCT__
thei would get an extra __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
here the question __PUNCT__
should exxonmobil be exclud from that cut in the corpor tax rate __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
we should be cut corpor tax for everi busi in america __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ barnei frank just said we go to take some of that monei awai from the rich peopl __PUNCT__
that what obama all about __PUNCT__
that what thi is about __PUNCT__
let me tell you __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ we tri a windfal profit tax back dure the dai of jimmi carter __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ we tri it __PUNCT__
it didn't work __PUNCT__
but the import thing is __PUNCT__ if you talk to the ceo of fedex __PUNCT__ fred smith __PUNCT__ if you talk to the ceo of cisco __PUNCT__ john chamber __PUNCT__ you talk to meg whitman __PUNCT__ former ceo of ebai __PUNCT__ you know what thei tell you __PUNCT__ thei tell you thei pai their full __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
and you know what els thei tell you __PUNCT__ when thei have the abil to go oversea __PUNCT__ unfortun thei do go oversea __PUNCT__
and you know why __PUNCT__ becaus we pai __PUNCT__ thei pai __NUM__ percent full freight __PUNCT__ no evas or escap from the tax __PUNCT__
thei pai full freight __PUNCT__ and thei show you their tax return __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ if thei go to ireland __PUNCT__ thei onli pai __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
so where ar thei go to go where thei can creat wealth and creat job __PUNCT__ it simpl fundament econom __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ to somehow alleg that a compani or corpor that can be intern is not go to go where thei pai the lowest tax and can creat the most job is just foolish __PUNCT__
the last time we practic thi kind of isolation and protection that senat obama espous on higher tax wa a gui name herbert hoover __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
we have anoth question from a viewer __PUNCT__ freder lumier of doylestown __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__
he sai he an independ __PUNCT__
he normal sai he vote republican __PUNCT__ but he sai you lost hi vote thi time becaus of what he call neg campaign __PUNCT__
here hi question __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ you got anybodi who sai thei chang their mind and thei support me __PUNCT__ you got a question from them __PUNCT__ wolf __PUNCT__ i just love to hear that __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__
here hi question __PUNCT__
he sai __PUNCT__ my question to you is about tax cut __PUNCT__
how can you explain to the american peopl that tax cut ar go to solv our econom crisi __PUNCT__ whether it might be for the rich or for the poor __PUNCT__ whoever it for __PUNCT__ when thei realli haven't work for the last eight year __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ all i can sai to him is that __PUNCT__ look at histori __PUNCT__
look at histori __PUNCT__
you rais tax dure an econom crisi time __PUNCT__ as we did in __PUNCT__ back in the time of herbert hoover __PUNCT__ you send the countri into a depress __PUNCT__
i not go to do that __PUNCT__
we have a fundament differ of opinion __PUNCT__
some peopl thing you got to spread the wealth around __PUNCT__ you got to rais tax __PUNCT__
as i said __PUNCT__ barnei frank and other have said we go to get those rich peopl __PUNCT__ and we go to take their monei from them __PUNCT__
fine __PUNCT__ if that what thei want to do __PUNCT__
and i can hardli __PUNCT__ it incred to think of speaker pelosi __PUNCT__ harri reid and barack obama with the tax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ spend polici that thei did in the past and that thei espous now and might happen in the futur __PUNCT__
it invigor me to keep my campaign go and go hard __PUNCT__
i don't want that to happen to america __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ social secur __PUNCT__ it a potenti problem out there for our children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ and you said noth is off the tabl as far as come up with some solut __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ term solut to social __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that funni __PUNCT__
that the wai you negoti __PUNCT__ and that the wai you negoti and get solut __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ there a cap at __MONEY__ for social secur payrol withhold tax __PUNCT__
ar you open __PUNCT__ as part of an effort to save social secur __PUNCT__ to let that cap go up __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i obvious against it __PUNCT__
and i want to tell you again __PUNCT__ the wai you succe in negoti __PUNCT__ and i done it mani time across the aisl __PUNCT__ whether it be ted kennedi or russ feingold or joe lieberman or anybodi els __PUNCT__ is you sit down __PUNCT__ and you negoti __PUNCT__
you go in with your negoti posit __PUNCT__
i go in with my negoti posit __PUNCT__
my posit is that i won't rais tax on anybodi __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ what about increas the retir ag from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i will have thing on the tabl __PUNCT__ we will negoti __PUNCT__
ronald reagan __PUNCT__ tip o'neil __PUNCT__ __NUM__ went in __PUNCT__ negoti and came out and save social secur __PUNCT__
guess what __PUNCT__ that what the american peopl want from us __PUNCT__
that what i done all the time i been in the congress of the unit state __PUNCT__
and so for me to sai anyth but i go to do what i saw two great leader __PUNCT__ tip o'neil and ronald reagan __PUNCT__ do is just foolish __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ so rais the retir ag __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ the democrat __PUNCT__ the reason why we couldn't get agreement in __NUM__ is becaus the democrat insist as a precondit that we rais tax __PUNCT__
so guess what __PUNCT__ we never sat down at the tabl togeth __PUNCT__
the american want us to sit down togeth __PUNCT__ wolf __PUNCT__
and so all i can tell you is i sit down with them __PUNCT__
i work with them befor __PUNCT__
i sit across the tabl from them __PUNCT__
i against tax increas __PUNCT__
i against a lot of the bad thing that a lot of the peopl support __PUNCT__
but i get a result __PUNCT__ and we save social secur __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ and how do you feel about rais the retir ag __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i feel veri strongli that i sit down with the democrat and we negoti out someth that will save social secur __PUNCT__ becaus that our oblig to futur gener of american __PUNCT__
and you can ask me __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ for the next half __PUNCT__ hour if you like __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ it would be kind of fun __PUNCT__ and my answer is go to be the same __PUNCT__
i will sit down and negoti the wai i have done in the past __PUNCT__ which sen __PUNCT__ obama ha never done __PUNCT__ whether it be in judici nomin or whether it be in immigr reform or ethic or lobbi reform __PUNCT__
he alwai went home to the democrat leadership __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ let talk a littl bit about your support __PUNCT__ and correct me if i wrong __PUNCT__ you did support presid bush plan to overhaul social secur and allow social secur recipi to us about __NUM__ percent of their social secur save in the stock market __PUNCT__
that collaps __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__
it didn't go forward __PUNCT__
know what we know now about the volatil of the stock market __PUNCT__ is that still a good idea __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ the reason why the talk collaps is becaus the democrat insist on agre to tax increas befor we sat down __PUNCT__
so let understand histori __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ what about social secur invest __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ crosstalk __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ that what thei want to do __PUNCT__
and all thi other stuff wa worth negoti __PUNCT__
and i will protect as presid of the unit state the social secur benefit of retire and futur retire __PUNCT__
i will protect those benefit __PUNCT__ and i do whatev necessari to protect those benefit __PUNCT__ and i said that time over time __PUNCT__
everi even __PUNCT__ number year __PUNCT__ democrat run out __PUNCT__ scare the senior citizen __PUNCT__ sai thei go to rais your tax __PUNCT__ thei go to destroi social secur __PUNCT__
same old stuff __PUNCT__
i seen it for more year than i can count __PUNCT__
i not scare ani senior __PUNCT__
i go to preserv their __PUNCT__ protect their social secur benefit __PUNCT__ despit what ad mai be run __PUNCT__
and the senior citizen __PUNCT__ as well as all citizen in thi countri __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ and the notion of us __NUM__ percent in the stock market __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__
thei know about how i go to fix social secur __PUNCT__
and i go to make their social secur the best i can __PUNCT__ and we preserv the benefit that thei have __PUNCT__ and i protect social secur __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ and the __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ and i protect social secur __PUNCT__ and i sit down at the tabl with the democrat __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we can keep __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ thi is __PUNCT__ i give you __PUNCT__ i tell __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ thi is an import issu __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__
i go to protect social secur __PUNCT__ and that what i done my entir career __PUNCT__
and i will do what ronald reagan and tip o'neil did __PUNCT__ and that is save social secur and make american awar that __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__ dai retire have __PUNCT__ work american todai ar not go to receiv the same benefit as present __PUNCT__ dai retire unless we fix it __PUNCT__
and i think i can convinc the american peopl that we sit down togeth __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ let move on and talk about nation secur __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ good __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ if you elect presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ do you believ america enemi __PUNCT__ whether terrorist or hostil govern __PUNCT__ would test you dure the first six month of your presid __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ we alreadi been test __PUNCT__
and i astonish and amaz to hear sen __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ biden predict that the untri __PUNCT__ untest presid obama will be test by our enemi __PUNCT__ and we mai not agre __PUNCT__ hi own backer mai not agre __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i been test __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ biden refer to the cuban missil crisi __PUNCT__
i wa there __PUNCT__
we came that close __PUNCT__ as historian sai __PUNCT__ to a nuclear exchang __PUNCT__
and sen __PUNCT__ biden expect __PUNCT__ hi own run mate expect sen __PUNCT__ obama to be test in that wai __PUNCT__ that a remark statement __PUNCT__ and that should concern all american __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but usual in a __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ there ar test earli on by hostil power out there __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ thei know i been test __PUNCT__
thei know i been test __PUNCT__
i been test mani time __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ the bush administr __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and the thing that probabl mai encourag them a littl is that sen __PUNCT__ obama ha been wrong __PUNCT__
he wa wrong about the surg in iraq __PUNCT__
he still fail to acknowledg that he wa wrong __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ remark __PUNCT__
he wa wrong when he said georgia should show restrain __PUNCT__
he wa wrong when he said he would sit down across the tabl from ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ chavez and the castro brother __PUNCT__
he wa wrong about those __PUNCT__
so i can understand why the american peopl might be concern __PUNCT__ particularli when hi own run mate is go to be test __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i been test __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ we got a limit amount of time __PUNCT__ so i just want to get a coupl thing in befor i let you go __PUNCT__
iraq __PUNCT__ a veri import issu right now __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ we still have __NUM__ troop in iraq __PUNCT__
the bush administr seem to be close to what call a statu of forc agreement with the iraqi govern of prime minist nuri al __PUNCT__ maliki __PUNCT__
it call __PUNCT__ the draft agreement __PUNCT__ at least __PUNCT__ for a complet withdraw of combat forc from villag and citi by __DATE__ of __NUM__ and out of the countri by __DATE__ __PUNCT__
if you elect presid __PUNCT__ would you as command in chief honor thi agreement if __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ it formal __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ with respect __PUNCT__ wolf __PUNCT__ and you know better __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__
you know better __PUNCT__
it condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__
it condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__
and ryan crocker __PUNCT__ our ambassador in baghdad __PUNCT__ said if you want to know what victori look like __PUNCT__ look at thi agreement __PUNCT__
so you know better than that __PUNCT__ wolf __PUNCT__
you know it condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ and that what the big fight wa all about __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ so you would accept thi if it on the tabl right now __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i alwai said we would be out base on condit __PUNCT__ and honor and victori __PUNCT__ and not defeat __PUNCT__
and it veri clear to ani observ now that if we had done what sen __PUNCT__ biden want to do __PUNCT__ break iraq up into three countri __PUNCT__ if we had done what sen __PUNCT__ obama want to do __PUNCT__ which wa immedi withdraw and set firm date for it __PUNCT__ we would have probabl been defeat in iraq __PUNCT__
and the problem there is we would have had increas iranian influenc __PUNCT__ we would have had sectarian violenc on the increas __PUNCT__
and probabl __PUNCT__ we would have had to go back __PUNCT__
so a big issu __PUNCT__
a big issu for the american peopl __PUNCT__
and i understand why it not on the front page or the lead on cnn __PUNCT__ becaus we have a rel secur environ that get more secur __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ we have to wrap up the interview __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__

your poll number were not veri good __PUNCT__ there were some formid challeng __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ thei were in the tank __PUNCT__
