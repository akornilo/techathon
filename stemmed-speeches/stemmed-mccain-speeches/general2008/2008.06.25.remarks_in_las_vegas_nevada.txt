thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
it good to be here in la vega __PUNCT__ and i appreci your invit me to speak about america energi problem __PUNCT__
some might think vega an unlik set for a discours touch on energi conserv __PUNCT__
and in the interest of breviti __PUNCT__ i just skip the part about air condit and neon light __PUNCT__
polit campaign have a wai of settl on a few great question __PUNCT__ with littl regard for the expect of pundit __PUNCT__ and even less concern for the carefulli craft strategi of the candid themselv __PUNCT__
these question ar rare easi __PUNCT__
politician usual avoid them for just that reason __PUNCT__
and so it is good when event intrud on the familiar routin of stale soundbit __PUNCT__ stage ralli __PUNCT__ and over __PUNCT__ manag messag __PUNCT__ and turn to the concern of the peopl themselv __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ the price and secur of energi in america is on of those great question __PUNCT__
it is an urgent question becaus the rise price of oil ha brought hardship to our countri __PUNCT__ and threaten to bring much more __PUNCT__
gasolin at well over four dollar a gallon is bad enough all by itself __PUNCT__ but it also affect the price of everyth els __PUNCT__
the cost of live is rise __PUNCT__
the valu of paycheck is fall __PUNCT__
mani of our citizen can't keep up __PUNCT__ and we need to think first of them __PUNCT__
as a countri __PUNCT__ we find ourselv caught between the rock of slower growth and the hard place of inflat __PUNCT__
all of thi __PUNCT__ in larg part __PUNCT__ becaus the price of oil is too high __PUNCT__ the suppli of oil is too uncertain __PUNCT__ and we depend on oil too much __PUNCT__
energi secur is a vital question becaus it concern america most fundament interest __PUNCT__ and abov all the safeti of our citizen from the violenc of the world __PUNCT__
all the tact of diplomaci cannot conceal a blunt realiti __PUNCT__
when we bui foreign oil __PUNCT__ we ar enrich some of our worst enemi __PUNCT__
and in the middl east __PUNCT__ venezuela __PUNCT__ and elsewher __PUNCT__ these regim know how to us the power of that wealth __PUNCT__
in the case of iran __PUNCT__ despit our own sanction __PUNCT__ thei us it to pursu nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
thei us it to threaten israel and other democraci __PUNCT__
elsewher __PUNCT__ oil wealth allow undemocrat govern to control their own peopl __PUNCT__ to crush dissent and to subjug women __PUNCT__
thei us it to financ terrorist around the world and crimin syndic in our own hemispher __PUNCT__
these ar some of the most stagnant and oppress societi on earth __PUNCT__ held back by oil __PUNCT__ rich elit who would not last long if their own peopl had a choic in the matter __PUNCT__
from these elit __PUNCT__ we get the oil that fuel our product economi __PUNCT__
from us __PUNCT__ thei get the monei that preserv their unjust power __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ by reli upon oil from the middl east __PUNCT__ we not onli provid wealth to the sponsor of terror __PUNCT__ we provid high __PUNCT__ valu target to the terrorist themselv __PUNCT__
across the world ar pipelin __PUNCT__ refineri __PUNCT__ transit rout __PUNCT__ and termin for the oil we r eli on __PUNCT__
and al qaeda terrorist know where thei ar __PUNCT__
even if these other interest were not in the balanc __PUNCT__ america would still need to follow the straightest path to energi secur __PUNCT__ becaus of a threat liter gather around the earth itself __PUNCT__
back when american first learn to associ the word __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ with __PUNCT__ crisi __PUNCT__ we didn't fulli understand how fossil fuel emiss retain heat within the atmospher __PUNCT__
we didn't know that over time these greenhous gass could warm the planet __PUNCT__
we didn't know thei could melt glacier and ic sheet __PUNCT__ or rais the water and alter the balanc that sustain life __PUNCT__
good stewardship __PUNCT__ prudenc __PUNCT__ and simpl common sens demand that we act to meet thi challeng __PUNCT__ act quickli __PUNCT__ and act togeth __PUNCT__
energi secur requir uniti becaus it is not just on issu among mani __PUNCT__ anoth box on the candid questionnair __PUNCT__
our countri need for a safe __PUNCT__ clean __PUNCT__ and afford suppli of energi is not just on more competitor for attent in washington __PUNCT__ on more special interest in an overcrowd field __PUNCT__
the great issu of energi secur is the sum total of so mani problem that confront our nation __PUNCT__
and it demand of us that we shake off old wai __PUNCT__ negoti new hazard __PUNCT__ and make hard choic long defer __PUNCT__
thi is a matter that ha confound nearli twenti congress and seven presid __PUNCT__
yet even now our energi debat carri the echo of ten __PUNCT__ twenti __PUNCT__ or even thirti year ago __PUNCT__
we hear the same call for new energi tax __PUNCT__ instead of new energi product __PUNCT__
we ar offer the same agenda of inact __PUNCT__ that long recit of thing we cannot do __PUNCT__ energi we cannot produc __PUNCT__ refineri we cannot build __PUNCT__ plant we cannot approv __PUNCT__ coal we cannot us __PUNCT__ technolog we cannot master __PUNCT__
the timid litani of limit goe on and on __PUNCT__
and it sai more about the cultur of washington than it doe about the charact of america __PUNCT__
in the same wai __PUNCT__ energi bill ar debat __PUNCT__ pass __PUNCT__ and sign into law with littl seriou thought to energi reform __PUNCT__ but never without the familiar corpor handout and fight over scrap of pork __PUNCT__
even now __PUNCT__ some in washington still seem to think the best plan is a direct __PUNCT__ heartfelt appeal for saudi sympathi __PUNCT__ as if that convei anyth other than weak __PUNCT__
in the wai of new idea __PUNCT__ a major of the hous of repres actual vote in favor of su opec __PUNCT__ as if we can litig our wai to energi secur __PUNCT__
ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ america is go to meet thi great challeng __PUNCT__ but we ar not go to do it as a supplic or as a plaintiff __PUNCT__
we ar not go to meet it with word at all __PUNCT__
we ar go to meet it with action __PUNCT__
and we ar go to meet thi challeng in a wai consist with the charact of our nation __PUNCT__
three decad of partisan paralysi on energi secur is enough __PUNCT__
sinc i am not presid __PUNCT__ i cannot sai the buck stop here __PUNCT__ but i will sai that it must stop now __PUNCT__
should i be entrust with the honor of that offic __PUNCT__ i will break the stalem in washington __PUNCT__ and i will put thi countri on a cours to energi secur __PUNCT__
i will author and support new explor and product of america own oil and ga reserv __PUNCT__ becaus we cannot outsourc the solut to america energi problem __PUNCT__
oppon of domest product cling to their posit even as the price of foreign oil ha doubl and doubl again __PUNCT__
thei were against it when a gallon of ga cost two dollar __PUNCT__
thei ar still against it when a gallon of ga cost well abov four dollar __PUNCT__
and we left to wonder what it will take to shake their faith in thi dogma of depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
as for me __PUNCT__ my convict place a prioriti on the well __PUNCT__ be of peopl who cannot afford these ever __PUNCT__ rise price __PUNCT__
everi year __PUNCT__ we ar send hundr of billion of dollar out of the countri for oil import __PUNCT__ much of it from opec __PUNCT__ while trillion of dollar __PUNCT__ worth of oil reserv in america go unus __PUNCT__
as a matter of fair __PUNCT__ we must deal with the here and now __PUNCT__ and assur afford fuel for america by produc more of it ourselv __PUNCT__
fair also requir that we reform the oil futur market __PUNCT__
we must purg the market of the reckless specul __PUNCT__ unrel to ani kind of product commerc __PUNCT__ that ha inflat the price of gasolin __PUNCT__ at the expens of work men and women across our countri __PUNCT__
with new regul __PUNCT__ i intend to assur integr in oil __PUNCT__ futur trade __PUNCT__ and to protect the public interest __PUNCT__
the need for more product extend as well to anoth long __PUNCT__ neglect sourc of energi __PUNCT__ and that is nuclear power __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ opposit to thi clean and proven technolog ha more to do polit than with the merit __PUNCT__
the experi of nation across europ and asia ha shown that nuclear energi is effici __PUNCT__
it is safe __PUNCT__ it is proven __PUNCT__ and it is essenti to america energi futur __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i will set thi nation on a cours to build __NUM__ new reactor by the year __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and i will set the goal of __NUM__ new plant to power the home and factori and citi of america __PUNCT__
thi task will be as difficult as it is necessari __PUNCT__
we will need to recov all the knowledg and skill that have been lost over three stagnant decad in a highli technic field __PUNCT__
as nevadan ar well awar __PUNCT__ we will need to solv complex problem of move and store materi that will alwai need safeguard __PUNCT__
we will need to do all of these thing __PUNCT__ and do them right __PUNCT__ as we have done great thing befor __PUNCT__
perhap no achiev would do more to secur our energi futur than the masteri of clean __PUNCT__ coal technolog __PUNCT__
from wyom to west virginia __PUNCT__ america coal resourc ar greater than the oil rich of ani kingdom of the middl east __PUNCT__
burn coal cleanli is a challeng of practic problem __PUNCT__ solv and human ingenu __PUNCT__ and we have no shortag of those in america either __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will commit two billion dollar each year __PUNCT__ until __NUM__ to clean __PUNCT__ coal research __PUNCT__ develop __PUNCT__ and deploy __PUNCT__
we will build the demonstr plant __PUNCT__
we will refin the techniqu and equip __PUNCT__
we will deliv not onli electr but job to some of the area hardest hit by our econom troubl __PUNCT__
and in the end __PUNCT__ we will make clean coal a realiti __PUNCT__
the strategi here is to produc more __PUNCT__ us less __PUNCT__ and invent new wai of do both __PUNCT__
and invent new wai is what we american do __PUNCT__
what we need most right now is better and faster innov in the car and truck we drive __PUNCT__
and govern polici is suppos to serv thi purpos __PUNCT__
yet the highest fuel effici standard ar useless if violat incur no seriou penalti __PUNCT__
incent for the purchas of fuel __PUNCT__ effici car ar too often the handiwork of lobbyist __PUNCT__ with all the inconsist and irration that involv __PUNCT__
support for corn __PUNCT__ base ethanol ha been a case studi in the law of unintend consequ __PUNCT__ distort food market through cropland competit __PUNCT__ and depriv america of better and cheaper altern fuel __PUNCT__
in each case __PUNCT__ our govern ha sought the right object __PUNCT__ but often with bad execut __PUNCT__
and thi failur of leadership must end __PUNCT__
standard in fuel effici serv a great nation goal __PUNCT__ and in my administr the penalti will assur complianc __PUNCT__
in place of the current patchwork of incent and credit for hybrid and other carbon __PUNCT__ cut vehicl __PUNCT__ we will issu a clean car challeng to the automak of america __PUNCT__ in the form of a singl and substanti tax credit to buyer base on the reduct of carbon emiss __PUNCT__
for everi automak who can sell a zero __PUNCT__ emiss car __PUNCT__ we will commit a __NUM__ dollar tax credit to each and everi custom who bui that car __PUNCT__
for other vehicl __PUNCT__ whatev type thei mai be __PUNCT__ the lower the carbon emiss __PUNCT__ the higher the tax credit __PUNCT__
instead of plai favorit among the lobbyist __PUNCT__ our govern must also level the plai field for all alcohol fuel that break the monopoli of gasolin __PUNCT__ to lower both gasolin price and carbon emiss __PUNCT__
thi can be done with a simpl feder standard to hasten the convers of all new vehicl in america to flex __PUNCT__ fuel technolog __PUNCT__ allow driver to us alcohol fuel instead of ga in their car __PUNCT__
whether it take a meet with automak dure my first month in offic __PUNCT__ or my signatur on an act of congress __PUNCT__ we will meet the goal of a swift convers of american vehicl awai from oil __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we must not overlook the possibl that on dai our car can run without burn liquid fuel at all __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ car can run on batteri power alon __PUNCT__ or as plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid us both liquid and electr __PUNCT__
some talent engin ar on the case __PUNCT__ but thi is a nation prioriti and we must give it nation focu __PUNCT__
to add urgenc to the mission __PUNCT__ we will offer a prize of __NUM__ million dollar __PUNCT__ a dollar for everi citizen __PUNCT__ to the creator of a batteri packag of a size __PUNCT__ capac __PUNCT__ cost __PUNCT__ and power far surpass exist technolog __PUNCT__
in the quest for altern to oil __PUNCT__ our govern ha thrown around enough monei subsid special interest and excus failur __PUNCT__
from now on __PUNCT__ we will encourag heroic effort in engin __PUNCT__ and we will reward the greatest success __PUNCT__
at thi moment __PUNCT__ some of the best mind in our countri ar also at work discov or perfect altern technolog __PUNCT__
thei ar not tilt at windmil __PUNCT__ thei build them __PUNCT__
thei ar captur the boundless power of the sun __PUNCT__ the tide __PUNCT__ the mighti river __PUNCT__ and the warmth of the earth itself __PUNCT__
yet for all the good work of entrepreneur and inventor in find cleaner and better technolog __PUNCT__ the fundament incent of the market ar still on the side of carbon __PUNCT__ base energi __PUNCT__
even with oil run at about __NUM__ dollar per barrel __PUNCT__ these new altern have yet to take the place of oil in our economi for two basic reason __PUNCT__ our infrastructur is outdat and our product capac ha been constrain __PUNCT__
and thi ha to chang as we can make the great turn awai from fossil fuel __PUNCT__
to lead in thi effort __PUNCT__ our govern must strike at the sourc of the problem __PUNCT__ with reform that onli congress can enact and the presid can sign __PUNCT__
we must do thi in a wai that give american busi new incent and new reward to seek __PUNCT__ instead of just give them new tax to pai and new order to follow __PUNCT__
the most direct wai to achiev thi is through a system that set clear limit on all greenhous gase __PUNCT__ while also allow the sale of right to excess emiss __PUNCT__
and thi is the propos i will submit to the congress if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system to chang the dynam of our energi economi __PUNCT__
for all of the last centuri __PUNCT__ the profit motiv basic led in on direct toward machin __PUNCT__ method __PUNCT__ and industri that us oil and ga __PUNCT__
enorm good came from that industri growth __PUNCT__ and we ar all the beneficiari of the nation prosper it built __PUNCT__
but there were cost we weren't count __PUNCT__ and these have ad up now __PUNCT__ in the atmospher __PUNCT__ in the ocean __PUNCT__ and all across the natur world __PUNCT__
and what better wai to correct past error than to turn the creativ energi of the free market in the other direct __PUNCT__ under the cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system __PUNCT__ thi can happen __PUNCT__
in all it power __PUNCT__ the profit motiv will suddenli begin to shift and point the other wai toward cleaner fuel __PUNCT__ wiser wai __PUNCT__ and a healthier planet __PUNCT__
as never befor __PUNCT__ the market would reward ani person or compani that seek to invent __PUNCT__ improv __PUNCT__ or acquir altern to carbon __PUNCT__ base energi __PUNCT__
it is veri hard to pictur ventur capitalist __PUNCT__ corpor planner __PUNCT__ small busi and environmentalist all work to the same good purpos __PUNCT__
but such cooper is actual possibl __PUNCT__ and thi reform will set it in motion __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ america depend on foreign oil wa a troubl situat __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
it wa an alarm situat twenti year ago __PUNCT__
it is a danger situat todai __PUNCT__
and start in the term of the next presid __PUNCT__ we must take control over our own energi futur __PUNCT__ and becom onc again the master of our fate __PUNCT__
in recent dai i have set befor the american peopl an energi plan __PUNCT__ the lexington project __PUNCT__ name for the town where american assert their independ onc befor __PUNCT__
and let it begin todai with thi commit __PUNCT__ in a world of hostil and unstabl supplier of oil __PUNCT__ thi nation will achiev strateg independ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi pledg is address to all concern __PUNCT__ to those abroad whose power flow from an accid of geologi __PUNCT__ and to you __PUNCT__ my fellow american __PUNCT__ whose strength proce from uniti of purpos __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we will break the power of opec over the unit state __PUNCT__
and never again will we leav our vital interest at the merci of ani foreign power __PUNCT__
some will sai thi goal is unattain within that rel short span of year __PUNCT__ it too hard and we need more time __PUNCT__
let me remind them that in the space of half that time __PUNCT__ about eight year __PUNCT__ thi nation conceiv and carri out a plan to take three american to the moon and bring them safe home __PUNCT__
in less than a third of that time __PUNCT__ the gather energi of my father gener built the industri might that overcam nazi germani and imperi japan __PUNCT__
that is the scale of our achiev when we set our mind to a task __PUNCT__
that is what thi countri can do when we see a danger __PUNCT__ and declar a purpos __PUNCT__ and find the will to act __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will turn all the apparatu of govern in the direct of energi independ for our countri __PUNCT__ author new product __PUNCT__ build nuclear plant __PUNCT__ perfect clean coal __PUNCT__ improv our electr grid __PUNCT__ and support all the new technolog that on dai will put the ag of fossil fuel behind us __PUNCT__
much will be ask of industri as well __PUNCT__ as automak and other adapt to thi great turn toward new sourc of power __PUNCT__
and a great deal will depend on each on of us __PUNCT__ as we learn to make smarter us of energi __PUNCT__ and also to draw on the best idea of both parti __PUNCT__ and work togeth for the common good __PUNCT__
thi project is not a plan calibr to pleas everi interest group or to meet everi object __PUNCT__
that is how we arriv to our present predica __PUNCT__
that is how energi polici in washington becam a long list of subject avoid __PUNCT__ option rule out __PUNCT__ and possibl foreclos __PUNCT__
nor can i promis you that the long __PUNCT__ term success of thi project will bring instant relief __PUNCT__
in the mission of energi secur __PUNCT__ some task ar the work of decad and some the work of year __PUNCT__
and thei will take all the will and resolv of which we ar capabl __PUNCT__
but i can promis you thi __PUNCT__
unless we begin thi mission now __PUNCT__ noth will chang at all __PUNCT__ except for the wors __PUNCT__
and when we succe in the hard reform ahead __PUNCT__ your children will live in a more prosper countri __PUNCT__ in a more peac world __PUNCT__
thi is a test of foresight __PUNCT__ of polit courag __PUNCT__ and of the unselfish concern that on gener ow to the next __PUNCT__
it is a test of our nation abil to deal with seriou matter in a seriou wai __PUNCT__
it is even a test of america charact __PUNCT__ of our capac to respond to pressur and to overcom advers __PUNCT__
american don't hide from histori or acquiesc in plai it victim __PUNCT__
we make histori __PUNCT__ and we make the futur better than the past __PUNCT__
in my life i have seen the charact of american test __PUNCT__ and test in the most extrem circumst __PUNCT__ and i never doubt that american can do hard thing and do them right __PUNCT__
that is what is ask of us right now __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ and togeth we will see the mission through __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
