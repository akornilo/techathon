thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
it a great pleasur to be introduc by governor sarah palin __PUNCT__ and i can't wait to introduc her to washington __PUNCT__
if governor palin and i ar elect in __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ we ar not go to wast a moment in chang the wai washington doe busi __PUNCT__
and we go to start where the need for reform is greatest __PUNCT__
in short order __PUNCT__ we ar go to put an end to the reckless conduct __PUNCT__ corrupt __PUNCT__ and unbridl greed that have caus a crisi on wall street __PUNCT__
here and all across our countri __PUNCT__ peopl ar wonder what exactli is happen on wall street __PUNCT__
and with good reason __PUNCT__ thei want to know how their govern will meet the crisi __PUNCT__
clear answer ar hard to come by in washington __PUNCT__
as senat obama leader in congress memor put it the other dai __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ no on know what to do __PUNCT__
perhap given that reaction __PUNCT__ it shouldn't surpris us that the congression leader of thi do __PUNCT__ noth congress also said that thei weren't go to take action until after the elect __PUNCT__ claim that it wasn't their fault __PUNCT__
i am hope that last night discuss ar a sign thei have chang their mind and will take action soon __PUNCT__
but ani action should be design to keep peopl in their home and safe guard the life save of all american by protect our financi system __PUNCT__
there ar certainli plenti of place to point finger __PUNCT__ and it mai be hard to pinpoint the origin event that set it all in motion __PUNCT__
but let me give you an educ guess __PUNCT__
the financi crisi we live through todai start with the corrupt and manipul of our home mortgag system __PUNCT__
at the center of the problem were the lobbyist __PUNCT__ politician __PUNCT__ and bureaucrat who succeed in persuad congress and the administr to ignor the fester problem at fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__
these quasi __PUNCT__ public corpor lead our hous system down a path where quick profit wa place befor sound financ __PUNCT__
thei institution a system that reward forc mortgag on peopl who couldn't afford them __PUNCT__ while turn around and sell those bad mortgag to the bank that ar now go bankrupt __PUNCT__
us monei and influenc __PUNCT__ thei prevent reform that would have curb their power and limit their abil to damag our economi __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ as ever __PUNCT__ the american taxpay ar left to pai the price for washington failur __PUNCT__
two year ago __PUNCT__ i call for reform of thi corrupt at fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__
congress did noth __PUNCT__
the administr did noth __PUNCT__
senat obama did noth __PUNCT__ and actual profit from thi system of abus and scandal __PUNCT__
while fanni and freddi were work to keep congress awai from their hous of card __PUNCT__ senat obama wa take their monei __PUNCT__
he got more __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ than ani other member of congress __PUNCT__ except for the democrat chairmen of the committe that overse them __PUNCT__
and while fanni mae wa betrai the public trust __PUNCT__ somehow it former ceo had manag to gain my oppon trust to the point that senat obama actual put him in charg of hi vice presidenti search __PUNCT__
thi ceo __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ johnson __PUNCT__ walk off with ten of million of dollar in salari and bonus for servic render to fanni mae __PUNCT__ even after author discov account improprieti that pad hi compens __PUNCT__
anoth ceo for fanni mae __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ rain __PUNCT__ ha been advis senat obama on hous polici __PUNCT__
thi even after fanni mae wa found to have commit quot __PUNCT__ extens financi fraud __PUNCT__ under hi leadership __PUNCT__
like mr __PUNCT__ johnson __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ rain walk awai with ten of million of dollar __PUNCT__
senat obama mai be take their advic and he mai be take their monei __PUNCT__ but in a mccain __PUNCT__ palin administr __PUNCT__ there will be no seat for these peopl at the polici __PUNCT__ make tabl __PUNCT__
thei won't even get past the front gate at the white hous __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ thi is the problem with washington __PUNCT__
peopl like senat obama have been too busi game the system and haven't ever done a thing to actual challeng the system __PUNCT__
we heard a lot of word from senat obama over the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__
but mayb just thi onc he could spare us the lectur __PUNCT__ and admit to hi own poor judgment in contribut to these problem __PUNCT__
the crisi on wall street start in the washington cultur of lobbi and influenc peddl __PUNCT__ and he wa squar in the middl of it __PUNCT__
the financi servic industri __PUNCT__ and there ar mani honest and honor peopl who work in it __PUNCT__ plai a vital role in our economi __PUNCT__
mutual fund compani help american save for retir __PUNCT__
bank and lend compani provid the mortgag that help us bui our home __PUNCT__
invest firm suppli the seed monei that help entrepreneur creat tomorrow job __PUNCT__
insur compani protect us against unknown risk __PUNCT__
yet as the financi crisi continu and bailout and bankruptci mount __PUNCT__ it clear financi firm have lost the trust of the american peopl __PUNCT__
that trust cannot be regain unless we adopt some fundament reform __PUNCT__
govern ha a clear respons to act and to defend the public interest __PUNCT__
that is exactli what i intend to do __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ to deal with the immedi crisi __PUNCT__ i will lead in the creation of the mortgag and financi institut trust __PUNCT__ the mfi __PUNCT__
the underli principl of the mfi or ani approach consid by congress should be to keep peopl in their home and safe guard the life save of all american by protect our financi system and capit market __PUNCT__
thi trust will work with the privat sector and regul to identifi institut that ar weak and fix them befor thei becom insolv __PUNCT__
the mfi is an earli intervent program to help financi institut avoid bankruptci __PUNCT__ expens bailout and damag to their custom __PUNCT__
thi will get the treasuri and other financi regulatori author in a proactiv posit instead of react in a crisi mode to on situat after anoth __PUNCT__
the mfi will restor investor and market confid __PUNCT__ build sound financi institut __PUNCT__ assist troubl institut and protect our financi system while minim taxpay exposur __PUNCT__
thi is an import step __PUNCT__ but it is not enough __PUNCT__
i will also take the addit action need to make sure a crisi like thi is never allow to build and break over the american peopl again __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i will propos and sign into law reform to prevent financi firm from conceal their bad practic __PUNCT__
an inexcus lack of financi transpar allow wall street firm to engag in reckless behavior that pad their profit and fatten execut bonus when time were good __PUNCT__ but now imperil the financi secur of million of american when their bet turn sour __PUNCT__
so much of the damag to our economi could have been avoid if these practic had been expos to the light of dai __PUNCT__
american have a right to know when their job __PUNCT__ pension __PUNCT__ ira __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ and our whole economi ar be put at risk by the reckless of wall street __PUNCT__
and under my reform for the financi sector __PUNCT__ that fundament right will be protect __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we need regulatori clariti __PUNCT__
the lack of transpar in our financi market went unnot by the regulatori agenc scatter throughout washington charg with protect the common good __PUNCT__
we got the sec __PUNCT__ the fdic __PUNCT__ the cftc __PUNCT__ the sipc __PUNCT__ the occ __PUNCT__ the fed __PUNCT__
at best __PUNCT__ thi confus assort of regul and institut wa egregi lax in carri out their respons __PUNCT__
at worst __PUNCT__ thei engag in the old washington game of guard their bureaucrat turf __PUNCT__ instead of safeguard the public interest and protect investor __PUNCT__
mani in the financi servic industri also either forgot or neglect their duti to act ethic and honor __PUNCT__
thi shortcom wa aid and abet by the creation of financi instrument that allow lender to escap ani respons for the risk of their loan __PUNCT__
in the past __PUNCT__ lender had to pai a price if thei made a bad loan __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ fanni mae and freddi mac work with wall street to bundl togeth all these dicei subprim loan and then push them off on investor who didn't have the tool of transpar need to assess or even understand the risk __PUNCT__
the current system promot confus __PUNCT__ encourag bureaucrat infight and creat incent for financi firm to cut corner __PUNCT__
we need to enhanc regulatori clariti by hold the same financi activ to on regulatori standard __PUNCT__
we don't need a dozen feder agenc do the job badli __PUNCT__ we need the best feder agenc to do the job right __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we must ensur that consum and investor ar protect __PUNCT__
our regulatori system must protect consum and investor by punish individu who engag in fraud __PUNCT__ break contract __PUNCT__ or lie to custom __PUNCT__ like the predatori lender who know you can't afford an adjust rate mortgag __PUNCT__ but mislead you into sign on __PUNCT__
these action ar crimin and the peopl who commit them should be behind bar __PUNCT__
and corpor govern rule will be reform so that sharehold have a clear sai in determin the pai of ceo and other senior execut __PUNCT__
on my watch __PUNCT__ the consequ for corpor abus will not be more enrich __PUNCT__ but more like an indict __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ in case where fail compani seek taxpay bailout __PUNCT__ the treasuri depart will follow consist polici in decid whether to guarante loan __PUNCT__
it must have well develop remedi for a financi crisi __PUNCT__
with billion of dollar in public monei at stake __PUNCT__ it will not do to keep make it up as we go along __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ the feder reserv should get back to it core busi of respons manag our monei suppli and inflat __PUNCT__
it need to get out of the busi of bailout __PUNCT__
the fed need to return to protect the purchas power of the dollar __PUNCT__
a strong dollar will reduc energi and food price __PUNCT__
it will stimul sustain econom growth and get thi economi move again __PUNCT__
all of these measur will calm and help us to avoid futur panic and disast in the financi market __PUNCT__
but to get through thi tough time for america __PUNCT__ and to come out stronger __PUNCT__ we need a strategi of econom growth __PUNCT__
and the massiv new tax burden that my oppon plan for the american economi is exactli the wrong answer __PUNCT__
hi tax increas __PUNCT__ along with the enorm new feder program he propos __PUNCT__ ar the surest wai to turn a recess into a depress __PUNCT__
in everi respect __PUNCT__ the obama tax hike would make thing even wors for the work peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__
i have propos __PUNCT__ and will sign into law __PUNCT__ an econom recoveri plan for work american that is direct to the middl class __PUNCT__
it will grow thi economi __PUNCT__ creat million of job and bring opportun back to american __PUNCT__
you will get a tax polici that creat famili prosper and allow you to save for the futur __PUNCT__
i will not rais your tax on incom or invest __PUNCT__
and we will simplifi the tax code so peopl can understand it and do their tax return themselv __PUNCT__
i will give everi famili a __MONEY__ credit to bui their own health insur polici and let them chose their own doctor __PUNCT__
thi will make insur afford to everi american __PUNCT__
i will doubl the child exempt from __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ to help famili pai for the rise cost of live __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ a marri coupl with two children make __MONEY__ will get __MONEY__ to pai for health insur and addit medic expens __PUNCT__
thi famili would get anoth __MONEY__ from my child exempt __PUNCT__
that add up to over __MONEY__
that is a lot more than what ani hardwork middl class famili __PUNCT__ get under the obama plan __PUNCT__
busi tax will be cut from the second highest in the world at __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
tax incent will spur invest in new plant and equip __PUNCT__
research and develop incent will keep compani on the cut edg of their industri __PUNCT__
healthcar cost will diminish __PUNCT__
compani will stop send job oversea to low __PUNCT__ cost __PUNCT__ low __PUNCT__ tax countri and start creat job here in america __PUNCT__
i will expand market for our good and servic __PUNCT__
a on in five of all job in thi countri ar link to world trade __PUNCT__
in five state alon pennsylvania __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ michigan __PUNCT__ wisconsin and colorado over __NUM__ million job depend on trade __PUNCT__
my econom recoveri plan will creat million of job in america instead of drive them oversea __PUNCT__
i will adopt an __PUNCT__ all of the abov __PUNCT__ energi polici which expand our us of oil __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ clean coal and nuclear facil __PUNCT__
we will embark on a nation mission to build an altern energi base __PUNCT__ creat million of new job __PUNCT__
we will creat the most diversifi energi economi in the world __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ i will return to the american economi the __MONEY__ billion dollar we send oversea everi year to bui oil __PUNCT__
my oppon offer a veri differ econom futur __PUNCT__
he ha continu shift hi posit on tax __PUNCT__
at the begin of thi campaign he promis to rais tax on your save and invest __PUNCT__
he said he won't rais tax for most peopl but he ha vote __NUM__ time in hi short senat career for tax increas and against tax cut __PUNCT__
he said he would onli tax the rich __PUNCT__ but he vote thi year to rais tax on those make just __MONEY__
senat obama ha simpli not given american good reason to trust him with your tax dollar __PUNCT__
my oppon is against lower tax on busi which ar the second highest in the world __PUNCT__
he will impos mandat health insur on busi that would cost up to __MONEY__ per employe __PUNCT__
he oppos free trade __PUNCT__
he also want to take awai the fundament right of worker to have a secret ballot when vote to be part of a union __PUNCT__
now is not the time for these destruct polici that will crippl busi growth __PUNCT__ destroi job and hurt the middl class __PUNCT__
now is the time to take action to address thi crisi and take action to put our economi back on a path of growth __PUNCT__
even though democrat leader sai thei don't know what to do __PUNCT__ i believ the deep problem afflict our financi system won't be solv by on polit parti __PUNCT__
there is onli on candid in thi race who ha a record of reach across the aisl to work out the bipartisan solut need to move our countri forward in time of crisi __PUNCT__ and i will bring that same spirit of bipartisan cooper to the white hous __PUNCT__
it took member of both parti to get america into thi mess __PUNCT__ and it will take all of us __PUNCT__ work togeth __PUNCT__ to lead the wai out __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
