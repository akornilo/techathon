if you go to georgia __PUNCT__ it a beauti littl countri __PUNCT__
there church that go back to the fourth and fifth centuri __PUNCT__
it wa part of thi __PUNCT__ of the russian empir __PUNCT__
then thei becam part of the soviet union __PUNCT__
thei broke free __PUNCT__ and thei had a terribl corrupt govern __PUNCT__
and there a young man name saakashvili who went to school in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
he went to georg washington univers __PUNCT__ and then he went to columbia __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ where my daughter __PUNCT__ meghan __PUNCT__ went to school __PUNCT__

but so did __PUNCT__ so did misha saakashvili __PUNCT__
and he came back to georgia __PUNCT__ and there wa a whole bunch of other young peopl like him who want democraci and freedom __PUNCT__
thei had a corrupt govern head by a gui name shevardnadz __PUNCT__ who you mai rememb from the dai of the cold war __PUNCT__
and thei had a peac revolut __PUNCT__ and thei took over __PUNCT__ and thei were put democraci and freedom and human right __PUNCT__
and thei were prosper __PUNCT__
and guess who didn't like it __PUNCT__ vladimir putin didn't like it __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we read about it in the histori book __PUNCT__ but we go through it __PUNCT__ and as we pars what happen __PUNCT__ and i sure that there wa some provoc __PUNCT__
but the fact is __PUNCT__ russian aggress wa overwhelm __PUNCT__ brutal __PUNCT__ loot __PUNCT__ murder __PUNCT__ kill __PUNCT__ and thei still to thi dai __PUNCT__ even though have sign a ceas __PUNCT__ fire agreement __PUNCT__ ar not leav __PUNCT__
why do we care __PUNCT__ of cours we alwai care about ani countri in the world where democraci and freedom is mayb strangl in the cradl __PUNCT__
but we also care becaus of what happen in the region __PUNCT__
the old russian ambit pre __PUNCT__ date the soviet union is to control that part of the world __PUNCT__
it not an accid that five presid of five countri __PUNCT__ ukrain __PUNCT__ poland __PUNCT__ lithuania __PUNCT__ latvia __PUNCT__ and estonia __PUNCT__ all came __PUNCT__ all came to tbilisi when that countri wa under attack __PUNCT__
and thei did it becaus thei know that their countri is go to be under pressur from the russian __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ and ukrain especi __PUNCT__
and why els do we care __PUNCT__ there a pipelin that goe through __PUNCT__ goe through that __PUNCT__ goe through georgia __PUNCT__ which is liter __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ is __PUNCT__ for all intent and purpos __PUNCT__ the onli oil pipelin that doesn't go through russia __PUNCT__
you have seen the russian us oil as a weapon __PUNCT__
when the czech agre with us to put some missil defens radar in their countri __PUNCT__ the russian cut back on their oil suppli __PUNCT__
so it also got to do with energi __PUNCT__
it got to do with energi __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ and world market __PUNCT__
and on thing i want to assur you of is that i will __PUNCT__ as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ achiev energi independ __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to send __MONEY__ billion a year oversea to countri who don't like us veri much __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and so keep the brave georgian in your thought and prayer __PUNCT__
and we have to take certain action as to whether russia should be in the world trade organ __PUNCT__ whether thei should be in the g __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ or now __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__ be g __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and other action that need to be taken __PUNCT__
but thi kind of provoc is not accept in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ an activ __PUNCT__
and just let me remind you __PUNCT__ and i do not make ani predict __PUNCT__ i hope that we can modifi russian behavior __PUNCT__ but i would remind you that war __PUNCT__ those of us that studi histori __PUNCT__ war and conflict have start at other obscur place in the world __PUNCT__

it wa quit an impress technolog marvel __PUNCT__
thei __PUNCT__ i think it __NUM__ barrel a dai of oil come through that oil rig __PUNCT__
and so my point is that thei do it off the coast of louisiana __PUNCT__ thei do it off the coast of texa __PUNCT__ and we need to drill off __PUNCT__ shore __PUNCT__ and we need to do it now off our shore __PUNCT__
and we can becom energi independ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ senat obama sai he want energi independ __PUNCT__ but he oppos to new drill at home __PUNCT__ he oppos to nuclear power __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ we have to have nuclear power __PUNCT__
nuclear power ha got to be part of ani wai of us be energi independ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ why should it take the french five year to build their nuclear power plant and us __NUM__ or more __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ the french now reprocess their spent nuclear fuel __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__
we could do that __PUNCT__
eighti percent of the french electr is gener by nuclear power __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we alwai want to be like the french __PUNCT__ but the fact is __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ in case you miss it __PUNCT__ we now have a pro __PUNCT__ american presid of franc __PUNCT__ which show you __PUNCT__ if you live long enough __PUNCT__ anyth can happen in the world __PUNCT__
but the fact is __PUNCT__ we need nuclear power __PUNCT__
but we need all of the abov __PUNCT__
we need wind __PUNCT__ tide __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__
where better place for solar than new mexico and arizona __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ tide __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ nuclear __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__
we need all of the abov __PUNCT__
america sit on the largest reserv of coal in the world __PUNCT__
we can develop clean __PUNCT__ coal technolog and becom independ __PUNCT__
we cannot afford thi __PUNCT__
we cannot afford thi __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a lot of time i hear that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we can't do thi __PUNCT__ we can't reprocess __PUNCT__ we can't store __PUNCT__ we can't build nuclear power plant __PUNCT__ we can't drill off __PUNCT__ shore __PUNCT__ we can't do thi __PUNCT__ we can't __PUNCT__ that not america __PUNCT__
that not what america is all about __PUNCT__
we met everi challeng __PUNCT__ and we can do it __PUNCT__ and we will do it __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ we will do it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ anywai __PUNCT__ senat obama think that rais tax on oil is go to bring down the price at the pump __PUNCT__
he claim that put air in your tire is the equival of new off __PUNCT__ shore drill __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that not an energi plan __PUNCT__
that a public servic announc __PUNCT__
and i all for it __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ but to think that it go to replac off __PUNCT__ shore drill obvious is not someth we agre to __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ biofuel __PUNCT__ other __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ we go to solv thi problem __PUNCT__ as i said __PUNCT__ by all of the abov __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on iraq __PUNCT__ senat obama sai he want peac __PUNCT__ but he still oppos the surg that succeed __PUNCT__
he oppos the surg __PUNCT__
he said that it wouldn't work __PUNCT__
he announc hi polici toward iraq the dai befor he left for the first time in over __NUM__ dai to visit iraq and then refus to acknowledg that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
remark __PUNCT__
remark __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ no ration observ could go to iraq and see what we succeed in do in the last two year and sai that the surg hasn't succeed __PUNCT__
that what thi is all about __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__
thi is what it all about __PUNCT__ secur our nation __PUNCT__
even in retrospect __PUNCT__ with all we know todai __PUNCT__ he still choos the path of retreat and failur __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ yesterdai __PUNCT__ senat obama got a littl testi on thi issu __PUNCT__
he said i question hi patriot __PUNCT__
let me be veri clear __PUNCT__ i am not question hi patriot __PUNCT__
i am question hi judgment __PUNCT__
i am question hi judgment __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ senat obama ha made it clear he valu withdraw from iraq abov victori in iraq __PUNCT__
even todai __PUNCT__ with victori in sight __PUNCT__ over and over again __PUNCT__ he advoc uncondit withdraw __PUNCT__ regardless of the fact on the ground __PUNCT__
and he vote against fund for troop in combat after he said it would be wrong to do so __PUNCT__
he made these decis not becaus he doesn't love america __PUNCT__ but becaus he doesn't think it matter whether america win or lose __PUNCT__
i go to end thi war __PUNCT__ and i go to bring them home __PUNCT__ and thei come home with honor in victori __PUNCT__ leav iraq secur as a democrat alli in the arab heartland __PUNCT__
that what i go to do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so beyond all the commerci and all the word and the campaign back __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ forth __PUNCT__ senat obama agenda can be summar at thi __PUNCT__ govern is too big __PUNCT__ he want to grow it __PUNCT__
tax ar too high __PUNCT__ he want to rais them __PUNCT__
congress spend too much __PUNCT__ and he propos more __PUNCT__
we need more energi __PUNCT__ and he against produc it __PUNCT__
we final __PUNCT__ we final win in iraq __PUNCT__ and he want to forfeit __PUNCT__
the bottom line is that senat obama word __PUNCT__ for all their eloqu and passion __PUNCT__ doesn't mean all that much __PUNCT__
and that the problem with washington __PUNCT__
it not just the bush administr and it not just the democrat congress __PUNCT__
it that everybodi in washington sai whatev it take to get elect or to score the polit point of the dai __PUNCT__
so i want to assur you we don't need anoth politician in washington who put self __PUNCT__ interest and polit expedi ahead of problem __PUNCT__ solv __PUNCT__
we want to start put our countri first and come togeth to keep american famili safe and help them realiz their dream for a better life __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so with that __PUNCT__ i like __PUNCT__ i like to stop by just sai __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ when we have an energi crisi and you pai __MONEY__ a gallon for ga __PUNCT__ whatev it is __PUNCT__ peopl who ar the lowest incom american ar drive the furthest in the oldest automobil __PUNCT__ bear a crush blow __PUNCT__

thei onli wealthi for on reason __PUNCT__ on reason __PUNCT__ over __MONEY__ price of oil __PUNCT__
that the onli reason why the russian economi is strong __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ some of their thing that thei done __PUNCT__ drive major corpor out of their countri and some of the other measur that thei take __PUNCT__ make them more and more depend on the petro __PUNCT__ dollar __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ it realli is anoth compel argument for us to becom energi independ __PUNCT__
we ar the world largest consum of oil __PUNCT__
so if we becom independ __PUNCT__ then it obvious go to lower the price of oil __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ it just __PUNCT__ it simpl mathemat and econom __PUNCT__
so i think that the european ar move in that direct __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ becaus thei don't like thi depend on russian oil __PUNCT__
but for a period of time __PUNCT__ thei go to be __PUNCT__

all too often __PUNCT__ our veteran ar __PUNCT__ do not receiv the care that thei have earn __PUNCT__
and the scandal of walter reed is a blot on the honor of the unit state of america __PUNCT__ and we can never let it happen again __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here __PUNCT__ here what i __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__
make as short as possibl __PUNCT__ our veteran have earn our highest prioriti __PUNCT__
and yet we know that there is also routin health care need that veteran have that __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ thei should not have to go to the v.a __PUNCT__ to receiv __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ we have __PUNCT__ tragic and unfortun in thi war __PUNCT__ a dramat __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we go to have a lot of ptsd __PUNCT__

so we have to focu our attent __PUNCT__ expand our capabl to treat ptsd __PUNCT__ combat __PUNCT__ relat injuri __PUNCT__ brain injuri __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__ that we best at __PUNCT__
and for a veteran with a routin health care need __PUNCT__ why shouldn't we give that veteran a card and take it to the health care provid or the doctor of their choic __PUNCT__ and get the routin health care that thei need __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ that what __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and that wai we could util the v.a __PUNCT__ and medic __PUNCT__ the militari medic system to it greatest effect and also reliev thi burden __PUNCT__

i got to see firsthand how social care wa so much afford __PUNCT__
he wa a fighter __PUNCT__ although it undermin hi muscl __PUNCT__
he lost hi voic __PUNCT__
i wa abl to provid better care for him in anoth countri than in our own __PUNCT__
and so i want to know about your health care plan __PUNCT__ how can it be afford __PUNCT__ how can we chang that __PUNCT__ why did i have to take him some place els so he could die in a better place than in hi own countri __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
and pleas accept the sympathi of all of us __PUNCT__
and thank you for hi servic __PUNCT__
i veri grate __PUNCT__
there is a health care crisi in america __PUNCT__
we would be __PUNCT__ if it were not for the energi crisi __PUNCT__ we be talk a lot more about health care issu __PUNCT__
and we have to reform health care in america __PUNCT__
and we have to make insur avail and afford for all american __PUNCT__
i do not believ that that mean a govern __PUNCT__ run health care system is the most effici __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ or what we need __PUNCT__
and we need to have polici that encourag home health care as oppos to institution care __PUNCT__
and we need to treat peopl on an outcom basi that don't pai for everi test or everi procedur __PUNCT__ everi visit to the doctor __PUNCT__ but treat them for a period of time __PUNCT__ and then pai that provid __PUNCT__
give __PUNCT__ there a __PUNCT__ there a program now for senior citizen that is __PUNCT__ that is not as wide as i like to see __PUNCT__ where it call cash __PUNCT__ counsel __PUNCT__
and senior ar given monei everi month __PUNCT__ and then thei abl to decid how thei want to pai for their own health care __PUNCT__
it remark the save that have been realiz __PUNCT__
but in case like your husband __PUNCT__ where thei basic __PUNCT__ uninsur __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ uninsur __PUNCT__ peopl with chronic diseas and such as the terribl afflict that befel your husband __PUNCT__ and i know he appreci your love and care __PUNCT__ but we should have what we call govern __PUNCT__ approv plan so that we pool feder and state monei togeth and establish wide risk pool so that there is afford and avail health insur for peopl like you and your husband __PUNCT__
we cannot leav the __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ uninsur __PUNCT__ or chronic diseas victim without the access to care __PUNCT__
and so it go to have to be a feder and state combin __PUNCT__ provid signific feder monei from the feder govern __PUNCT__ and we ar go to have to have that as a major part of health care reform __PUNCT__ becaus we can't allow ani american __PUNCT__ ani american citizen to experi what your husband experienc __PUNCT__

also __PUNCT__ we prai for you everi dai __PUNCT__ my famili and i __PUNCT__ just to make sure you safe and secur in your health and everyth __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ also __PUNCT__ i like to ask a question __PUNCT__
my dad us to work for earthlink __PUNCT__ and now thei move to india __PUNCT__
so what would you do __PUNCT__ what step would you take to ensur that multin compani would stai in america __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thank you for bring that up __PUNCT__ becaus busi tax in america ar __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
thei the second __PUNCT__ highest in the world __PUNCT__
onli the japanes pai higher busi tax than we do __PUNCT__
you know what the tax is in ireland that had a boom economi __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ at least up until recent __PUNCT__ eleven percent __PUNCT__
so you own a busi __PUNCT__ and you have the abil to go oversea or stai in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ what ar you go to do __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ that ha taken busi and job and job and job out of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so i would reduc that tax immedi to __NUM__ percent and even bring it lower as soon as we could __PUNCT__ becaus it doe mean that job leav thi countri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i believ that the american worker is the most product __PUNCT__ the most innov __PUNCT__ and the best in the world __PUNCT__
but if you own a busi and you want to make a profit __PUNCT__ becaus that why we in the capitalist busi of capit then __PUNCT__ and you see a place where you can go __PUNCT__ then i understand why you might __PUNCT__
so we have to lower that tax in order to keep a more level plai field __PUNCT__
and the businesspeopl i talk to __PUNCT__ thei want to stai in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thei would rather stai here __PUNCT__ for a whole varieti of reason __PUNCT__ not the least of which is patriot __PUNCT__ but also becaus the product of the worker __PUNCT__
but when thei see these kind of incent __PUNCT__ then obvious thei have a tendenc to leav __PUNCT__
so i would reduc thi busi tax __PUNCT__ and i would do it immedi __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ that anoth differ between myself and senat obama __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ question __PUNCT__ nice to meet you __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__
on behalf of boi nation __PUNCT__ which i just return from __PUNCT__ a great program __PUNCT__ i glad that the govern sponsor that so much __PUNCT__
i veri thank that we have system like thi that can promot youth understand in our govern __PUNCT__

thank you __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i like to give you a littl straight talk __PUNCT__
and i sorri to have to do it __PUNCT__ but you probabl know it __PUNCT__
otherwis you wouldn't ask the question __PUNCT__
in it present fiscal statu __PUNCT__ social secur will not be there in it present form as it is for retire todai __PUNCT__
is that right __PUNCT__ is that the right thing to do to thi young man __PUNCT__ peopl ar work or pai into a system that thei not go to get the same benefit from as present __PUNCT__ dai retire __PUNCT__
it a disgrac __PUNCT__
it a disgrac __PUNCT__
and i want to tell you __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i call in the democrat __PUNCT__ or i go see them __PUNCT__ i don't care __PUNCT__ and republican __PUNCT__ and we sit around the tabl __PUNCT__ and we sai __PUNCT__ we fix social secur __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ a long time ago __PUNCT__ social secur wa go broke __PUNCT__
it wa go broke __PUNCT__ and it wa __PUNCT__ that just a fact __PUNCT__
and arm with a studi by alan greenspan __PUNCT__ presid reagan and tip o'neil __PUNCT__ who wa the liber democrat from massachusett __PUNCT__ sat down togeth __PUNCT__
thei walk out togeth into the rose garden and said __PUNCT__ we go to fix social secur __PUNCT__
and thei did __PUNCT__ for about __NUM__ or __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
so what do we do now __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__
we get into a big fight about privat save account and other aspect of the issu __PUNCT__ when realli what we should be do is sit down across the tabl and recogn that our oblig is to you __PUNCT__
our oblig is to you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i give them all the credit __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ if thei want all the credit when we fix it __PUNCT__ fine __PUNCT__
i give it to them __PUNCT__
but the point is that american want us to work these thing out __PUNCT__
and onc we work on of them out and get approv __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ did you notic late the approv rate of congress is at __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ anybodi in that __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ pleas rais your hand __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ you get down that low __PUNCT__ you get down to paid staffer and blood rel __PUNCT__
you don't get much lower than that __PUNCT__
so i think that __PUNCT__ work togeth __PUNCT__ we can __PUNCT__ congress can regain some of that approv __PUNCT__ by work togeth for our countri for a chang __PUNCT__
but your point is exactli accur __PUNCT__
right behind you is a young woman there __PUNCT__
mayb i could hear from her __PUNCT__
question __PUNCT__ thank you for come __PUNCT__
what specif ar you go to do for the commun that don't have anyth __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i sorri __PUNCT__
question __PUNCT__ what specif ar you go to do for the commun that don't have anyth __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ let me just __PUNCT__ thank you for the question __PUNCT__
and i sorri that acoust ar a littl poor __PUNCT__
but thank you __PUNCT__
i think on of the __PUNCT__ on of the most import thing i can do for these commun that you talk about is to make sure that thei have an educ opportun that in wealthier commun that thei have __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ we have __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ ha now the right after a struggl to attend school __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what kind of a benefit is that if thei __PUNCT__ if their onli choic is a fail school __PUNCT__ and it a fact __PUNCT__ it a fact that at lower econom area have wors school system than higher incom area __PUNCT__
it just a fact __PUNCT__
so what i want to do is make sure that everi child in america and everi parent in america ha the same choic that i and my wife __PUNCT__ cindi __PUNCT__ did and senat obama and mr __PUNCT__ obama had __PUNCT__ and that is to send your child to the choic __PUNCT__ the school of your choic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that mean charter school __PUNCT__
it mean public school __PUNCT__
it mean home __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__
it mean vouch __PUNCT__
it mean __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ it mean to give them a choic __PUNCT__
those commun that you talk about __PUNCT__ unless we provid a train and educ program for them __PUNCT__ will never becom econom better __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ just two quick point __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ new orlean __PUNCT__
i think mani of you mai know that new orlean wa __PUNCT__ as we all know __PUNCT__ wa wipe out __PUNCT__
and so thei start from squar on __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ there over __NUM__ charter school in new orlean todai __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ their educ is improv dramat __PUNCT__
new york citi __PUNCT__ new york citi __PUNCT__ thei took over the school system __PUNCT__ and thei been close fail school __PUNCT__ and thei been reward good teacher for good perform __PUNCT__ and good princip __PUNCT__ and good school __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ the test score ar go up __PUNCT__
so it all got to do __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ with provid parent and children with a choic __PUNCT__
and that competit then increas educ __PUNCT__ and that __PUNCT__ that what __PUNCT__ what i like to do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ question __PUNCT__ as a third __PUNCT__ gener new mexican __PUNCT__ i appreci you come __PUNCT__
my famili ha been here for a long time __PUNCT__
and we have a lot of problem across the border __PUNCT__
we had over __NUM__ women over the last __NUM__ year kill and across thi border __PUNCT__
we have town right across the border __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ where the polic depart ha abandon their posit __PUNCT__
we had over __NUM__ peopl kill sinc christma __PUNCT__
we had a pastor shot down __PUNCT__ gun down in hi rehab to defend the children that were under hi care __PUNCT__
we need a surg on the border __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i thank you __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ twice __PUNCT__ i tri to get __PUNCT__ in a bipartisan fashion __PUNCT__ immigr reform pass by the congress of the unit state __PUNCT__
and we fail twice __PUNCT__
and we fail becaus the american peopl __PUNCT__ and it is a feder respons __PUNCT__ not a local respons __PUNCT__ not the sheriff __PUNCT__ respons __PUNCT__ not the legislatur __PUNCT__ state legislatur __PUNCT__ respons __PUNCT__
it a feder respons __PUNCT__
we fail becaus the american peopl didn't believ us when we said we would secur the border __PUNCT__
so it clear that we have to get our border secur __PUNCT__ have a temporari __PUNCT__ worker program that truli temporari __PUNCT__ and address the issu of the __NUM__ million to __NUM__ million peopl who ar alreadi in thi countri illeg __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i be glad to go through all the detail with you __PUNCT__ but i would also like to point out __PUNCT__ and i know that you includ thi in your remark __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ on the other side of the border __PUNCT__ and everybodi in thi room know the border __PUNCT__
you know the problem __PUNCT__ you know the challeng __PUNCT__
i don't have to tell you __PUNCT__ that we now have corrupt polic __PUNCT__ and we have a struggl between the mexican govern and these drug cartel for supremaci in mexico __PUNCT__
some week ago or a coupl of month ago __PUNCT__ on of the highest rank feder polic offici in mexico citi went to hi apart __PUNCT__ which wa suppos to be total anonym __PUNCT__
he wa shot eight time in the head __PUNCT__
and the gui who shot him had the kei to hi apart __PUNCT__
the corrupt is a battl that thei ar in todai __PUNCT__
and i happi to sai that i think that presid calderon __PUNCT__ the presid of mexico __PUNCT__ is dedic to try to regain control of hi side of the border from the drug cartel __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here in new mexico and in arizona __PUNCT__ standard procedur of the drug dealer __PUNCT__ the cartel is to send __NUM__ or so illeg across the border __PUNCT__ call the border patrol __PUNCT__
the border patrol come and round up the illeg __PUNCT__
thei leav __PUNCT__ and the drug dealer come across __PUNCT__
so thi is not just the illeg immigr problem __PUNCT__
it is these __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ these ar the __PUNCT__ it hard to __PUNCT__ the brutal and cruelti practic by these peopl in the drug cartel is beyond our imagin __PUNCT__
so we now have for the first time a plan call the merida initi with the mexican govern __PUNCT__
and we go to spend __MONEY__ million at least of american dollar to try to coordin with the mexican govern to get these drug cartel and the border under control __PUNCT__
and it is a nation secur issu __PUNCT__
we all know that __PUNCT__
that why it a feder respons __PUNCT__
so let give presid calderon a littl credit __PUNCT__ becaus i think __PUNCT__ for the first time __PUNCT__ if not the first time __PUNCT__ it the first time a most seriou effort is be made to combat these drug cartel and control the border on their side __PUNCT__
how much easier would the job be of control our border if we had the mexican serious control the border on that side __PUNCT__ as the canadian do __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ so let give them a littl credit __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ we go back at thi issu __PUNCT__
we go back at thi issu __PUNCT__ becaus it a feder respons and we must do it __PUNCT__
and i also like to sai __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ what everybodi in thi room know __PUNCT__
these ar god children __PUNCT__
these peopl that come here ar come for a job __PUNCT__
thei come for the same reason why we did __PUNCT__
and when i see stori of a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old girl that di in the desert with a rosari around her neck __PUNCT__ then we have an oblig __PUNCT__ becaus we ar a judeo __PUNCT__ christian __PUNCT__ valu nation __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
and we valu and cherish in thi part of the countri __PUNCT__ new mexico __PUNCT__ arizona __PUNCT__ texa __PUNCT__ we valu and cherish our hispan heritag __PUNCT__
but we also understand that we have to have secur border and we have to do it becaus it a nation secur respons __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
uh __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ a piec of paper __PUNCT__
question __PUNCT__ i want to turn the topic back to educ __PUNCT__
i an associ professor here at new mexico state univers __PUNCT__
and i like to ask that __PUNCT__ as no child left behind is reauthor __PUNCT__ that gift educ be part of the mandat __PUNCT__ becaus we focus our attent on struggl student and student with disabl __PUNCT__ which is critic __PUNCT__ but we also need to focu our attent on gift student __PUNCT__
gift student can make signific contribut to our societi and do mani of the thing that you been talk about in scienc and industri __PUNCT__
and if we deni the fact that thei think differ and provid them differ servic through educ __PUNCT__ then thei have a more difficult time accept the fact that thei ar differ __PUNCT__
and without that person accept __PUNCT__ thei cannot make the signific contribut that thei capabl of __PUNCT__
here in new mexico __PUNCT__ thei try to pass a new fund formula which will elimin the add __PUNCT__ on fund for gift educ __PUNCT__
and if there were a nation mandat for gift educ __PUNCT__ then thing like that wouldn't happen in a state like new mexico __PUNCT__ where altern assess ar critic to make sure the underrepres popul that ar gift ar also serv __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
mai i sai that you were veri gift in your present __PUNCT__ and i thank you __PUNCT__
and i mean that __PUNCT__
i agre with you __PUNCT__
and i would also make two addit point __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ we need to provid more incent and abil for math __PUNCT__ scienc and engin student __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ becaus we ar fall behind in that area __PUNCT__
everybodi know that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we should __PUNCT__ we should reach a point at least where peopl with those specialti ar abl to secur a full and complet educ __PUNCT__
but i also like to mention on other aspect of the issu of educ __PUNCT__ two point __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ no child left behind need to be reauthor __PUNCT__
we need to learn the lesson __PUNCT__
we don't need to discard it complet __PUNCT__
the second thing is __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ a terribl thing that happen in america recent __PUNCT__ as i know you all know __PUNCT__ is the rise of autism __PUNCT__
we don't know __PUNCT__
we don't know what caus it __PUNCT__
there a huge debat go on now about vaccin __PUNCT__
and i read and studi and gotten brief __PUNCT__ and i don't know all the answer __PUNCT__
but i do know it a fact that autism is on a dramat rise in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and we got to find the caus of it __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ meanwhil __PUNCT__ we go to have to increas fund for special educ __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ it just __PUNCT__ it just a fact __PUNCT__
and that expens __PUNCT__ but it seem to me the kind of countri we ar __PUNCT__ that that should have on of our prioriti __PUNCT__ along with our most gift __PUNCT__
so thank you __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ ma'am __PUNCT__
question __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ i am __PUNCT__ thank you for come __PUNCT__
