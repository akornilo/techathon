but __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i think that ani campaign tactic that thei want to us that accept to the american peopl __PUNCT__ it is certainli their right to do that __PUNCT__
l __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ but i mean do you think that the reason that it close in state that he won __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
