thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
i appreci the hospit of the santa barbara museum of natur histori __PUNCT__ and the warm welcom to california __PUNCT__
i here to listen about energi issu as well as to talk __PUNCT__
so let me just start thing off with a few idea __PUNCT__
we in the middl of a great debat in thi presidenti campaign about the energi secur of the unit state __PUNCT__
for my part __PUNCT__ in recent dai i been lai out a clear agenda to protect our economi from runawai energi cost __PUNCT__ and to break america depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
thi is go to requir the best effort and idea of our countri __PUNCT__ and i am confid we ar up to the task __PUNCT__
at a time when a gallon of ga is run at more than four dollar __PUNCT__ our govern need to shake off year of partisan paralysi that have prevent america from achiev energi secur __PUNCT__
noth is more urgent right now than regain our energi secur __PUNCT__ we need to get it done and get it right __PUNCT__
the immedi problem of high gasolin price and of our strateg depend on foreign oil ar upon us __PUNCT__
and on recent dai i been set forth a plan of action __PUNCT__
when peopl ar hurt __PUNCT__ and struggl to afford gasolin __PUNCT__ food __PUNCT__ and other necess __PUNCT__ common sens requir that we draw upon america own vast reserv of oil and natur ga __PUNCT__
when nation across europ and asia ar build nuclear power plant to meet their electr need __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ must make more us of thi clean __PUNCT__ effici __PUNCT__ and proven sourc of power __PUNCT__
and we must turn all the brillianc and ingenu of america loos in the search for altern energi sourc __PUNCT__ from cleaner coal and wind power to biofuel and solar __PUNCT__
but even as we address our present econom and strateg troubl __PUNCT__ we face a long __PUNCT__ term danger we hardli even understood back when america first learn to associ the word __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ with __PUNCT__ crisi __PUNCT__
we now know that fossil fuel emiss __PUNCT__ by retain heat within the atmospher __PUNCT__ threaten disastr chang in climat __PUNCT__
no challeng of energi is to be taken lightli __PUNCT__ and least of all the need to avoid the consequ of global warm __PUNCT__
among the compel evid of thi danger __PUNCT__ satellit imag reveal shrink glacier __PUNCT__ antarct ic shelv and polar ic sheet __PUNCT__
our scientist have also seen and measur reduc snowpack __PUNCT__ with earlier runoff in the pacif northwest and elsewher __PUNCT__
we have seen sustain drought in the southwest __PUNCT__ and across the world averag temperatur that seem to reach new record everi few year __PUNCT__
in the frozen wild of alaska __PUNCT__ the arctic __PUNCT__ antarct __PUNCT__ and elsewher __PUNCT__ wildlif biologist have note sudden chang in anim migrat pattern __PUNCT__ a loss of their habitat __PUNCT__ a rise in sea level __PUNCT__
the fact of global warm demand our urgent attent __PUNCT__ especi in washington __PUNCT__
good stewardship __PUNCT__ prudenc __PUNCT__ and simpl commonsens demand that we act to meet the challeng __PUNCT__ and act quickli __PUNCT__
to dramat reduc carbon emiss __PUNCT__ i have propos a new system of cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade that over time will chang the dynam of our energi economi __PUNCT__
we will cap emiss accord to specif goal __PUNCT__ measur progress by refer to past carbon emiss __PUNCT__
by the year __NUM__ we will seek a return to __NUM__ level of emiss __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ a return to __NUM__ level __PUNCT__ and so on until we have achiev at least a reduct of sixti percent below __NUM__ level by the year __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in thi wai __PUNCT__ we will transit into a low carbon energi futur while stai on a cours of econom growth __PUNCT__
the purpos of thi plan is to give american busi new incent and reward to seek __PUNCT__ instead of just give new tax to pai and new order to follow __PUNCT__
my strategi give peopl time to adapt __PUNCT__ instead of caus a jolt to your electr bill and widespread shutdown of tradit coal __PUNCT__ fire plant __PUNCT__
for the market to do more __PUNCT__ govern must do more by open new path of invent and ingenu __PUNCT__
so i have propos a perman research and develop tax credit __PUNCT__ to open the door to a new gener of environment entrepreneur __PUNCT__
i am commit to invest two billion dollar everi year for the next __NUM__ year on clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ to unlock the potenti of america oldest and most abund resourc __PUNCT__
and we will issu a clean car challeng to automak __PUNCT__ in the form of a tax credit to the american peopl __PUNCT__ for everi automak who can sell a zero __PUNCT__ emiss or veri close to zero __PUNCT__ emiss car __PUNCT__ we will commit up to a __NUM__ dollar tax credit to each and everi custom who bui that car __PUNCT__
in the quest for altern to oil __PUNCT__ our govern ha thrown around enough monei subsid special interest and excus failur __PUNCT__
from now on __PUNCT__ we will encourag heroic effort in engin __PUNCT__ and we will reward the grea test success __PUNCT__
thi is why i further propos we inspir the ingenu and resolv of the american peopl by offer a __MONEY__ million prize for the develop of a batteri packag that ha the size __PUNCT__ capac __PUNCT__ cost and power to leapfrog the commerci avail plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid or electr car __PUNCT__
thi is on dollar for everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child in the u. __PUNCT__ a small price to pai for help to break the back of our oil depend __PUNCT__ and should deliv a power sourc at __NUM__ percent of the current cost __PUNCT__
energi effici is no longer just a moral luxuri or a person virtu __PUNCT__
a smarter us of energi is part of a critic nation effort to regain control of our own energi futur __PUNCT__
and in thi effort __PUNCT__ practic idea ar worth a lot more than uplift lectur __PUNCT__
it not alwai a matter of make due with less energi __PUNCT__
it a matter of us energi in smarter wai __PUNCT__
busi owner who invest in green build can cut their energi cost by as much as a third __PUNCT__
homeown can save hundr or even thousand of dollar a year with better light bulb __PUNCT__ applianc __PUNCT__ window __PUNCT__ and insul __PUNCT__
mani californian have understood the benefit of green technolog for a while now and your governor sure understand them __PUNCT__
now we need to bring that smart ethic of environment care to washington __PUNCT__
our feder govern is never shy about instruct the american peopl in good environment practic __PUNCT__
but energi effici __PUNCT__ like chariti __PUNCT__ should begin at home __PUNCT__
so i propos to put the purchas power of the unit state govern on the side of green technolog __PUNCT__
everi year the feder govern bui upward of __NUM__ car and other vehicl __PUNCT__ not includ militari or law __PUNCT__ enforc vehicl __PUNCT__
from now on __PUNCT__ we go to make those civilian vehicl flex __PUNCT__ fuel capabl __PUNCT__ plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__ or car fuel by clean natur ga __PUNCT__
if our great goal is to move american transport toward lower carbon emiss __PUNCT__ then it should start with the feder fleet __PUNCT__
across our countri and abroad __PUNCT__ there ar __NUM__ billion squar feet of feder offic space __PUNCT__ all but roughli ten percent of it own by the public __PUNCT__
add it all up and that make the feder govern the singl largest consum of electr in the world __PUNCT__
thi present anoth enorm opportun that my administr will take __PUNCT__
by retrofit where possibl __PUNCT__ and by appli a higher effici standard to new build leas or purchas __PUNCT__ we can save taxpay billion of dollar in energi cost __PUNCT__ and move the market in the direct of green technolog __PUNCT__
we must also redesign our nation electr grid in a smarter __PUNCT__ more effici wai __PUNCT__
in some case __PUNCT__ our nation power transmiss system ha not been built to match suppli and demand __PUNCT__
and the result is an excess of power where it not need __PUNCT__ and a shortag of power where it is need __PUNCT__
in the long term __PUNCT__ thi will requir a seriou invest to upgrad our nation grid to meet the demand of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ which will includ a capac to charg the electr car that will on dai fill the road and highwai of america __PUNCT__
and to save both monei and electr power for our peopl and busi __PUNCT__ we will also need to deploi smartmet technolog __PUNCT__
these new meter give custom a more precis pictur of their overal energi consumpt __PUNCT__ and over time will encourag a more cost __PUNCT__ effici us of power __PUNCT__
in these and other wai __PUNCT__ we can meet the challeng of global warm with all the resourc of human ingenu at our dispos __PUNCT__
like other environment challeng __PUNCT__ onli more so __PUNCT__ climat chang present a test of foresight __PUNCT__ of polit courag __PUNCT__ and of the unselfish concern that on gener ow to the next __PUNCT__
we american like to sai that there is no problem we can't solv __PUNCT__ howev complic __PUNCT__ and no obstacl we cannot overcom if we meet it togeth __PUNCT__
i believ thi about our countri __PUNCT__
i know thi about our countri __PUNCT__
and now it is time for us to show those qualiti onc again __PUNCT__
i thank you all for the kind attent __PUNCT__ and now let me turn you over to my friend on the panel __PUNCT__
