let me also congratul you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ on the great work of the clinton global initi __PUNCT__
it sai a lot about a man that after __NUM__ year as a governor __PUNCT__ and anoth eight year at the resolut desk __PUNCT__ he is still work hard in servic to other __PUNCT__
bill clinton is a man who ha achiev enough in public servic __PUNCT__ by ani measur except hi own __PUNCT__
thi man drive __PUNCT__ and determin __PUNCT__ and compass for those in need ar still a forc for good in the world __PUNCT__ and i am proud to call him a friend __PUNCT__
your kind invit brought me here to discuss some of the great concern of the clinton global initi __PUNCT__ and especi climat chang __PUNCT__ extrem poverti __PUNCT__ and epidem diseas __PUNCT__
but i know you will understand if i begin by address a crisi of our own right here in america __PUNCT__ a crisi that began not far from here in the financi district of thi citi __PUNCT__
we know thi is a crisi with seriou implic and consequ for our nation and other __PUNCT__
histori must not record that when our nation face such a moment __PUNCT__ it leadership wa unabl to put asid polit and to focu in a unifi wai to solv thi problem __PUNCT__
it time for everyon to recal that the polit process is not an end in itself __PUNCT__ nor is it intend to serv those of us who ar in the middl of it __PUNCT__
in the senat of the unit state __PUNCT__ our duti is to serv the peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__ and we can serv them best now by put polit asid and deal in a focus __PUNCT__ straightforward __PUNCT__ bi __PUNCT__ partisan wai with the problem at hand __PUNCT__
for the congress __PUNCT__ thi is on of those moment in histori when poor decis __PUNCT__ made in hast __PUNCT__ could turn a crisi into a far __PUNCT__ reach disast __PUNCT__
if we do not act __PUNCT__ credit will dry up __PUNCT__ with grave consequ for worker and busi across the american economi and beyond __PUNCT__
peopl will no longer be abl to bui home and their life save will be at stake __PUNCT__
busi will not have enough monei to pai their employe __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as ever __PUNCT__ the greatest burden is born by the american peopl __PUNCT__
seven hundr billion dollar is a stagger and unpreced figur __PUNCT__ and there should be no misunderstand about the dimens of thi propos __PUNCT__
seven hundr billion dollar __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ could rebuild the crumbl infrastructur in everi town __PUNCT__ counti __PUNCT__ and state in thi countri __PUNCT__
a great deal is be ask of the american peopl __PUNCT__
and great care must be taken to ensur their protect __PUNCT__
i an old navi pilot __PUNCT__ and i know when a crisi call for all hand on deck __PUNCT__
that the situat in washington at thi veri hour __PUNCT__ when the whole futur of the american economi is in danger __PUNCT__
i cannot carri on a campaign as though thi danger situat had not occur __PUNCT__ or as though a solut were at hand __PUNCT__ which it clearli is not __PUNCT__
as of thi morn i suspend my polit campaign __PUNCT__
with so much on the line __PUNCT__ for america and the world __PUNCT__ the debat that matter most right now is take place in the unit state capitol __PUNCT__ and i intend to join it __PUNCT__
senat obama is do the same __PUNCT__
america should be proud of the bipartisanship we ar see __PUNCT__
it ha becom clear that no consensu ha develop to support the administr propos to meet the crisi __PUNCT__
i do not believ that the plan on the tabl will pass as it current stand __PUNCT__ and we ar run out of time __PUNCT__
so i am return to washington to seek five fundament improv to thi critic legisl __PUNCT__
i have laid out these principl over the past week __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ there must be greater account includ in the bill __PUNCT__
i have suggest a bipartisan board to provid oversight for the rescu __PUNCT__
we will not solv a problem caus by poor oversight with a plan that ha no oversight __PUNCT__
never befor in the histori of our nation ha so much power and monei been concentr in the hand of on person __PUNCT__ and there must be protect and oversight in place __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ as a part of that oversight __PUNCT__ there must be a path for taxpay to recov the monei that is put into thi fund __PUNCT__
when we talk about __NUM__ billion taxpay dollar __PUNCT__ that monei cannot simpli go into a black hole of bad debt with no mean of recov ani of the fund __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ there must be complet transpar in the review of thi legisl and in the implement of ani legisl __PUNCT__
thi cannot be thrown togeth behind close door __PUNCT__
the american peopl have the right to know which busi will be help __PUNCT__ what that select will be base on and how much that help will cost __PUNCT__
all the detail should all be made avail onlin and elsewher for open public scrutini __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ it is complet unaccept for ani kind of earmark to be includ in thi bill __PUNCT__
it would be outrag for legisl and lobbyist to pack thi rescu plan with even more taxpay monei for favor compani __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ member of congress who would attempt such a thing ar scarc better than the most reckless oper on wall street __PUNCT__
fifth and final __PUNCT__ no wall street execut should profit from taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
let me put it thi wai __PUNCT__ i would rather build a bridg to nowher __PUNCT__ and put it squar in the middl of sedona __PUNCT__ arizona __PUNCT__ than take monei from teacher and farmer and small busi owner to line the pocket of the wall street crowd that got us here in the first place __PUNCT__
and i can assur you __PUNCT__ if i have anyth to sai about the matter __PUNCT__ it not go to happen __PUNCT__
it is difficult to act both quickli and wise __PUNCT__ but that is what is requir of us right now __PUNCT__
time is short __PUNCT__ and do noth is not an option __PUNCT__
i am confid that befor the market open on mondai we can achiev consensu on legisl that will stabil our financi market __PUNCT__ protect taxpay and homeown __PUNCT__ and earn the confid of the american peopl __PUNCT__
i have seen republican and democrat achiev great thing togeth __PUNCT__
when the stake were high and it matter most __PUNCT__ i seen them work togeth in common purpos __PUNCT__ as we did in the week after __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thi kind of cooper ha made all the differ at crucial turn in our histori __PUNCT__
it ha given us hope in difficult time __PUNCT__
it ha move america forward __PUNCT__ through all advers __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ in thi crisi __PUNCT__ we must work togeth again and put our countri first __PUNCT__
all of thi come on top of other hardship that american have been deal with __PUNCT__ especi the rise cost of energi __PUNCT__
and these __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ as you well understand at the clinton global initi __PUNCT__ ar problem that requir us to call upon the best idea of both parti __PUNCT__
for the futur of our economi __PUNCT__ noth is more essenti than a secur and afford suppli of energi __PUNCT__
as you well know __PUNCT__ peopl ar hurt becaus the cost of gasolin is out of control __PUNCT__
small farmer __PUNCT__ trucker __PUNCT__ and taxi driver in thi citi and elsewher ar unabl to cover their cost __PUNCT__
small busi owner ar struggl to meet payrol __PUNCT__
for american worker __PUNCT__ the cost of live is rise and the valu of paycheck fall __PUNCT__
all of thi __PUNCT__ in larg part __PUNCT__ becaus the price of oil is too high __PUNCT__ and the suppli of oil too uncertain __PUNCT__
these citizen believ their govern ha a duti to final assur the energi secur of thi countri __PUNCT__ and thei ar right __PUNCT__
everi form of econom activ requir the us of energi __PUNCT__
and that is why we need to draw on the best idea of both parti on energi polici __PUNCT__ and work togeth for the common good __PUNCT__
among our challeng is on that we hardli even understood back when america first learn to associ the word __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ with __PUNCT__ crisi __PUNCT__
we now know that fossil fuel emiss __PUNCT__ by retain heat within the atmospher __PUNCT__ threaten disastr chang in climat __PUNCT__
no challeng of energi is to be taken lightli __PUNCT__ and least of all the need to avoid the consequ of global warm __PUNCT__
over time __PUNCT__ we must shift our entir energi economi toward a sustain mix of new and cleaner power sourc __PUNCT__
thi will includ some we us alreadi __PUNCT__ such as wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ biofuel __PUNCT__ and other sourc yet to be invent __PUNCT__
it will includ a varieti of new automot and fuel technolog __PUNCT__ clean __PUNCT__ burn coal and nuclear energi __PUNCT__ and a new system of incent __PUNCT__ under a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade polici __PUNCT__ to put the power of the market on the side of environment protect __PUNCT__
to make the great turn awai from carbon __PUNCT__ emit fuel __PUNCT__ we will need all the invent geniu of which america is capabl __PUNCT__
we will need as well an economi strong enough to support our nation great shift toward clean energi __PUNCT__
global warm present a test of foresight __PUNCT__ of polit courag __PUNCT__ and of the unselfish concern that on gener ow to the next __PUNCT__
we need to think straight about the danger ahead __PUNCT__ and meet the problem with all the resourc of human ingenu at our dispos __PUNCT__
we american like to sai that there is no problem we can't solv __PUNCT__ howev complic __PUNCT__ and no obstacl we cannot overcom if we meet it togeth __PUNCT__
i believ thi about our countri __PUNCT__
and now it is time for us to show those qualiti onc again __PUNCT__
as we deal with thi challeng __PUNCT__ we must also address the other that imperil our global secur __PUNCT__
todai too mani around the world ar exclud from the benefit of global __PUNCT__
disconnect from the prosper that ha lift million out of poverti __PUNCT__ too mani societi ar plagu by violenc __PUNCT__ diseas __PUNCT__ and scarciti __PUNCT__
it need not be thi wai __PUNCT__
and in place where scarciti can breed resent __PUNCT__ despair __PUNCT__ and extrem __PUNCT__ where problem cannot be contain by border __PUNCT__ it must not be thi wai __PUNCT__
we can never guarante our secur through militari mean alon __PUNCT__
true secur requir a far broader approach __PUNCT__ us non __PUNCT__ militari mean to reduc threat befor thei gather strength __PUNCT__
and thi is especi true of our strateg interest in fight diseas and extrem poverti across the globe __PUNCT__
promot develop __PUNCT__ creat opportun __PUNCT__ and elimin diseas do not onli serv our nation interest __PUNCT__ thei also accord with our deepest american valu __PUNCT__
we ar a great and gener countri __PUNCT__ and we believ that all men and women __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ar creat equal and endow by god with certain right __PUNCT__
in fight diseas __PUNCT__ and spare unnumb live across the world __PUNCT__ we serv not onli strateg interest __PUNCT__
we serv our moral interest __PUNCT__ and we show the good heart of america __PUNCT__
malaria alon kill more than a million peopl a year __PUNCT__ mostli in africa __PUNCT__
nearli three thousand children ar lost everi dai just to thi on afflict __PUNCT__ a diseas well within our abil to erad __PUNCT__
to it last credit __PUNCT__ the feder govern in recent year ha led the wai in thi fight __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ america is more than it govern __PUNCT__
some of the greatest advanc have been the work of the gate foundat and other privat __PUNCT__ charit group __PUNCT__
and you have my pledg that __PUNCT__ should i be elect __PUNCT__ i will build on these and other initi to ensur that malaria kill no more __PUNCT__
i will also make it a prioriti to improv matern and child health __PUNCT__
million around the world __PUNCT__ and especi pregnant women and children __PUNCT__ suffer from easili prevent nutrit defici __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ a million children under ag five die everi year __PUNCT__ million more ar born mental impair __PUNCT__ and entir economi ar left to stagnat __PUNCT__
an intern effort is need to prevent diseas and development disabl among children by provid nutrient and food secur __PUNCT__
and if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ america will lead that effort __PUNCT__
as we have done with the scourg of hiv and aid __PUNCT__ we should embark on a more concert effort to fight tuberculosi __PUNCT__ which account for nearli two million death each year __PUNCT__
we should work to dramat rais agricultur product in africa __PUNCT__ america help to spark the green revolut in asia __PUNCT__ and thei should be at the forefront of an african green revolut __PUNCT__
we should reform our aid program __PUNCT__ to make sure thei ar serv the interest of peopl in need __PUNCT__ and not just serv special interest in washington __PUNCT__
aid is not the whole answer __PUNCT__
we need to promot econom growth and opportun __PUNCT__ especi for women __PUNCT__ where thei do not current exist __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ trade restrict __PUNCT__ combin with costli agricultur subsidi for the special interest __PUNCT__ choke off the opportun for poor farmer and worker abroad to help themselv __PUNCT__
that ha to chang __PUNCT__
and by promot free trade __PUNCT__ and end unfair subsid __PUNCT__ i intend to be the agent of chang __PUNCT__
you know someth about great chang at the clinton global initi __PUNCT__ becaus you ar strive everi dai to bring it about __PUNCT__
i thank each on of you for the good work you have done to reliev suffer across the earth __PUNCT__ and to spread hope __PUNCT__
i thank you for the even greater work that you seek to accomplish in the year to come __PUNCT__ under the leadership of the man from hope __PUNCT__
and i thank you all for your kind attent here todai __PUNCT__
