yet __PUNCT__ when duti requir it __PUNCT__ he gave the order for b __PUNCT__ 52 to bomb hanoi __PUNCT__ in close proxim to my prison __PUNCT__
i have live a bless life __PUNCT__ and the first of my bless wa the famili i wa born into __PUNCT__
i had not onli the exampl of my distinguish male relat __PUNCT__ and their long tradit of militari servic __PUNCT__
i wa fortun to grow up under the influenc of strong __PUNCT__ capabl __PUNCT__ accomplish women __PUNCT__ first among them __PUNCT__ my mother __PUNCT__ the formid roberta mccain __PUNCT__ her ident twin __PUNCT__ rowena __PUNCT__ my strict and impos patern grandmoth __PUNCT__ catherin __PUNCT__ and equal impress matern grandmoth __PUNCT__ myrtl __PUNCT__
for much of my childhood __PUNCT__ my mother wa the parent who rais me __PUNCT__ my sister and brother __PUNCT__
my father wa often at sea __PUNCT__ and she bore all the respons of both parent __PUNCT__
she move us from base to base __PUNCT__ often drive us across countri on her own __PUNCT__ manag our household __PUNCT__ paid the bill __PUNCT__ saw to our educ and religi upbring __PUNCT__ and made of our itiner childhood __PUNCT__ an interest __PUNCT__ excit time __PUNCT__ rich with fascin experi __PUNCT__
she wa and is a resili woman __PUNCT__ extrovert __PUNCT__ uncomplain __PUNCT__ forthright and determin __PUNCT__ who greet everi challeng as an opportun to measur on strength of charact and learn about the wider world beyond our immedi environ __PUNCT__
the famili i wa born to __PUNCT__ and the famili i am bless with now __PUNCT__ made me the man i am __PUNCT__ and instil in me a deep and abid respect for the social institut that wield the greatest influenc in the format of our individu charact and the charact of our societi __PUNCT__
i mai have been rais in a time when govern did not dare to assum the respons of parent __PUNCT__
but i am a father in a time when parent worri that threat to their children well __PUNCT__ be ar prolifer and undermin the valu thei have work to impart to them __PUNCT__
that is not to sai that govern should dictat to parent how to rais their children or assum from parent ani part of that most person and import respons __PUNCT__
no govern is capabl of care for children as attent and wise as the mother and father who love them __PUNCT__
but govern must be attent to the impact of it polici on famili so that it doe not through inattent or arrog make it harder for parent to have the resourc to succe in the greatest work of their live __PUNCT__ rais their children __PUNCT__
and where govern ha a role to plai __PUNCT__ in educ __PUNCT__ in combat the threat to the secur and happi of children from onlin predat __PUNCT__ in help to make health care afford and access to the least fortun among us __PUNCT__ it must do so urgent __PUNCT__ effect and wise __PUNCT__
tax polici must not rob parent of the mean to care for their children and provid them the opportun their parent provid them __PUNCT__
govern spend must not be squander on thing we do not need and can't afford __PUNCT__ and which don't address a singl american concern for their famili secur __PUNCT__
govern can't just throw monei at public educ while reinforc the failur of mani of our school __PUNCT__ but should __PUNCT__ through choic and competit __PUNCT__ by reward good teacher and hold bad teacher account __PUNCT__ help parent prepar their children for the challeng and opportun of the global economi __PUNCT__
govern must be attent to the impact on famili of parent who have lost job in our chang economi that won't come back __PUNCT__
our program for displac worker ar antiqu __PUNCT__ repetit and ineffect __PUNCT__
mani were design for a time when unemploy wa season or a temporari consequ of an econom downturn __PUNCT__ not for a time when system chang wrought by the grow global economi have __PUNCT__ while promis undreamt of opportun for ourselv and mani histor poor societi __PUNCT__ have cost too mani parent the job thei had assum would be their for life __PUNCT__
with the loss of work and the resourc it provid famili __PUNCT__ come just as injuri loss to the emot health of famili __PUNCT__
work provid more than an incom __PUNCT__
it is a sourc of self __PUNCT__ worth __PUNCT__ pride and sens of purpos __PUNCT__
children learn as much from observ as instruct __PUNCT__
the mother or father who ha lost hope along with their job can unintention impart that hopeless to their children __PUNCT__
a welfar check can't give a parent a sens of purpos __PUNCT__
and among the most import thing children can inherit from their parent is a sens of purpos __PUNCT__ and an aspir to be part of someth bigger than themselv __PUNCT__
my parent taught me that __PUNCT__ and i will alwai be indebt to them __PUNCT__
but like mani young peopl __PUNCT__ i didn't understand the lesson veri well until later in life when i need it most __PUNCT__
as a boi __PUNCT__ my famili legaci __PUNCT__ as fascin as it wa to me __PUNCT__ often felt like an imposit __PUNCT__
i knew from a veri earli ag that i wa destin for annapoli and a career in the navi __PUNCT__
in reaction __PUNCT__ i often rebel in small and petti wai to what i perceiv as an encroach on my free will __PUNCT__
i conced that i rememb with affect the unruli passion of youth __PUNCT__ and how thei govern my immatur sens of honor and self __PUNCT__ respect __PUNCT__
as i grew older __PUNCT__ and the challeng to my self __PUNCT__ respect grew more vari and seriou __PUNCT__ i wa surpris to discov that while my sens of honor had matur __PUNCT__ it defens matter even more to me than it did when it wa such a vulner thing that ani empti challeng threaten it __PUNCT__
like most peopl __PUNCT__ when i reflect on the adventur and joi of youth __PUNCT__ i feel a long for what is lost and cannot be restor __PUNCT__
but though the happi pursuit of the young prove ephemer __PUNCT__ someth better can endur __PUNCT__ and endur until our last moment of life __PUNCT__
and that is the honor we earn and the love we give when we work and sacrific with other for a caus greater than our self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
for me that caus ha long been our countri __PUNCT__
i am a lucki __PUNCT__ lucki man to have found it __PUNCT__ and am forev grate to those who show me the wai __PUNCT__
what thei gave me wa much more valuabl and last than the tribut i onc paid to vaniti __PUNCT__
i am the son and grandson of admir __PUNCT__
my grandfath wa an aviat __PUNCT__ my father a submarin __PUNCT__
thei were my first hero __PUNCT__ and their respect for me ha been on of the most last ambit of my life __PUNCT__
thei gave their live to their countri __PUNCT__ and taught me lesson about honor __PUNCT__ courag __PUNCT__ duti __PUNCT__ persever and leadership that i didn't fulli grasp until later in life __PUNCT__ but rememb when i need them most __PUNCT__
i have been an imperfect servant of my countri for mani year __PUNCT__
but i am their son __PUNCT__ and thei show me how to love my countri __PUNCT__ and that ha made all the differ for me __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ all the differ in the world __PUNCT__
