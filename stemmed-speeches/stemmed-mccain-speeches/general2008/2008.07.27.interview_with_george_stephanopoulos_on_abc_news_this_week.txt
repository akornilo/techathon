and by the wai __PUNCT__ our ambassador to iraq basic said we have succeed __PUNCT__
we have succeed in thi strategi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__
senat obama doesn't understand __PUNCT__
he doesn't understand what at stake here __PUNCT__
and he chose to take a polit path that would have help him get the nomin of hi parti __PUNCT__
i took a path that i knew wa unpopular __PUNCT__ becaus i knew we had to win in iraq __PUNCT__
and we ar win in iraq __PUNCT__
and if we done what senat obama want done __PUNCT__ it would have been chao __PUNCT__ genocid __PUNCT__ increas iranian influenc __PUNCT__ perhap al qaeda establish a base again __PUNCT__
now we have a stabl alli in the region __PUNCT__ and it is not base on ani date __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but it doe seem like __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i like six month __PUNCT__ three month __PUNCT__ two month __PUNCT__
i like yesterdai __PUNCT__
i like yesterdai __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ that seem realli good to me __PUNCT__

you also sai __PUNCT__ timet sound great __PUNCT__ but it on the condit on the ground __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ senat obama said that he would come out no matter what __PUNCT__
he said that he would be out __PUNCT__ accord to hi origin plan __PUNCT__ it would have been last march __PUNCT__
he sai that the surg ha not work __PUNCT__
he said it couldn't work __PUNCT__
there a fundament differ between myself and senat obama __PUNCT__
and now that it the gener elect come up __PUNCT__ i can see why he and hi peopl ar try to blur that distinct __PUNCT__
when the decis had to be made whether to adopt the strategi of the surg __PUNCT__ he said it wouldn't work __PUNCT__ it would increas sectarian violenc __PUNCT__
he said all those thing that made it accept to the left of hi parti __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but there wa a fundament differ about the origin decis to go to war __PUNCT__
he said it would inflam the muslim world __PUNCT__ it would becom a recruit tool for al qaeda __PUNCT__
you said __PUNCT__ and you wrote __PUNCT__ that it would lessen antipathi in the muslim world __PUNCT__ and that we be greet as liber __PUNCT__
wasn't senat obama right about that __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't believ so __PUNCT__
we were greet as liber __PUNCT__
we mishandl the war for nearli four year __PUNCT__
we mishandl it in a wai that wa so harm that i stood up against it __PUNCT__
i said it wouldn't work __PUNCT__
i said we had to have a new strategi __PUNCT__ and i wa critic for be disloy __PUNCT__ disloy to republican __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you also said mani time that the strategi wa the right strategi __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i said that saddam hussein caus a __PUNCT__ impos a threat to the unit state of america and our secur __PUNCT__
and the oil for food scandal __PUNCT__ the __MONEY__ billion he wa skim __PUNCT__ the fact that he had said that he had in oper and he want to have weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ the fact that thi societi that he rule in such a brutal fashion wa realli aw __PUNCT__
and he did pose a long __PUNCT__ term threat to the secur of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
but that a job for the historian __PUNCT__
when the crucial time came as to whether we were go to leav iraq and lose __PUNCT__ or stai and do the veri unpopular thing of __NUM__ addit troop __PUNCT__ ask young american to make the sacrific __PUNCT__ he wa wrong __PUNCT__ i wa right __PUNCT__
that wa the crucial point __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ and you don't __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ in the strategi __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__
accept that he wa right and you were wrong __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ on the origin decis __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
of cours not __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you also taken some heat thi week with your comment sai that senat obama would rather lose __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ a war than win a polit campaign __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ i can't believ you believ that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i not question hi patriot __PUNCT__
i question hi action __PUNCT__
i question hi lack __PUNCT__ total lack __PUNCT__ of understand __PUNCT__
hi __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but that is question hi total __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ when you sai someon would rather lose a war __PUNCT__ a candid __PUNCT__ that question hi honor __PUNCT__ hi decenc __PUNCT__ hi charact __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ all i sai is __PUNCT__ and i will repeat __PUNCT__ he doe not understand __PUNCT__
i not question hi patriot __PUNCT__
i am sai that he made the decis __PUNCT__ which wa polit __PUNCT__ in order to help him get the nomin of hi parti __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ put live at risk for a polit campaign __PUNCT__ you believ he do that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i believ that __PUNCT__ when he said that we had to leav iraq __PUNCT__ and we had to be out by last march __PUNCT__ and we had to have a date certain __PUNCT__ that wa in contravent to __PUNCT__ and still is __PUNCT__ the chairman of the joint chief of staff __PUNCT__ gener david petraeu __PUNCT__
when he never ask to sit down for a brief with gener petraeu __PUNCT__ our command on the ground __PUNCT__ when he wait __NUM__ dai to go back again __PUNCT__ where young american live ar on the line __PUNCT__ i think that a fundament lack of understand __PUNCT__
and i think the american peopl will make the appropri choic __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but you question hi motiv __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i sai that it wa veri clear that a decis had to made __PUNCT__
and i made it when it wasn't popular __PUNCT__
he made a decis which wa popular with hi base __PUNCT__
and that is a fundament differ __PUNCT__
and he doe not understand __PUNCT__ and did not understand and still doesn't understand __PUNCT__ that the surg wa the vital strategi in us not have to lose a war __PUNCT__
chao __PUNCT__ genocid __PUNCT__ increas influenc of iranian in the region __PUNCT__
the consequ of failur would have been sever __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ the benefit ar enorm of a stabl alli in the region __PUNCT__ of a countri that is a friend of our __PUNCT__ a brake on iranian influenc __PUNCT__ certainli a brake on al qaeda and other jihadist organ __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ he made the decis that that wa the best wai to go to get the nomin of hi parti __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ there also been a flap about senat obama decis in germani not to visit the troop at landstuhl __PUNCT__
he now sai that __PUNCT__ base on what he wa hear from the pentagon __PUNCT__ there wa no wai that wouldn't be seen as a polit trip __PUNCT__ which is why he decid not to go __PUNCT__
do you accept that explan __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i know thi __PUNCT__ that those troop would have love to have seen him __PUNCT__
and i know of no pentagon regul that would have prevent him from go there __PUNCT__ without the media and the press and all of the associ peopl __PUNCT__ noth that i know of would have kept him from visit those wound troop __PUNCT__
and thei ar grave wound __PUNCT__ mani of them __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ he done it mani time in the past __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ in landstuhl __PUNCT__ germani __PUNCT__ when i went through __PUNCT__ i visit __PUNCT__ i visit the hospit __PUNCT__
but the import thing is that __PUNCT__ if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldn't visit those troop __PUNCT__ and i wa there and want to be there __PUNCT__ i guarante you __PUNCT__ there would have been a seismic event __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ i believ he had the opportun to go without the media __PUNCT__
and i let the fact speak for themselv __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ thi is __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ it certainli wasn't the pentagon __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ campaign __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ that certainli what the pentagon spokesman said __PUNCT__
there wa noth to prevent him from go __PUNCT__ if he went without the press and the media and hi campaign peopl __PUNCT__
but we see what happen __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ fair game __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think peopl make a judgment by what we do and what we don't do __PUNCT__
he certainli found time to do other thing __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ let talk about the economi __PUNCT__
presid bush in __PUNCT__ and ad some unvarnish talk recent about the economi when he didn't think the camera were on __PUNCT__
i think he said __PUNCT__ wall street got drunk __PUNCT__ and now we go through the hangov __PUNCT__
i know you don't want to us languag like that __PUNCT__ but is hi basic take right __PUNCT__ is wall street the villain here __PUNCT__ and what would you do about it __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think that wall street is the villain in the thing that happen in the subprim lend crisi and other area where investig and possibl prosecut is go on __PUNCT__
but i also think that congress is at fault __PUNCT__
we didn't restrain spend __PUNCT__
spend got complet out of control __PUNCT__
we were __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but what doe that have to do with the mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ it increas __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ or with the hous crisi __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it increas the deficit __PUNCT__
we didn't address the energi crisi __PUNCT__ which ha been build for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we now send __MONEY__ billion of american __PUNCT__ monei oversea to countri that don't like us veri much __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i think there a lot of blame to go around here __PUNCT__
but i also would blame a gridlock congress __PUNCT__ which is gridlock as we speak __PUNCT__ when we should be do offshor drill __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ the gridlock __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ we should be move forward with nuclear power __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ the gridlock broke todai on the hous bill __PUNCT__
it pass __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ __NUM__ to __NUM__ in the senat __PUNCT__
i know you couldn't be there __PUNCT__
would you have vote for that bill __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
but i also see __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ the influenc of special interest __PUNCT__
thei place the respons for try to help solv some of these problem of peopl remain in their home __PUNCT__ and it is real and signific __PUNCT__ in the hand of the lender __PUNCT__
i would have like to have seen the homeown __PUNCT__ the primari resid __PUNCT__ go down and get the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year fha guarante loan at the new valu of their home __PUNCT__ and put it in the hand of the borrow __PUNCT__ the homeown __PUNCT__
but i support __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ then why vote for the bill __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ becaus it better than noth __PUNCT__
it better than __PUNCT__ it mai give relief to sever hundr thousand homeown __PUNCT__
or if it give relief to on __PUNCT__ it a __PUNCT__ but i think it can provid some relief __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ sever of your colleagu look at thi bill and sai it could put the taxpay on the hook for up to __MONEY__ billion for fanni mae __PUNCT__
thei look at the govern step in to help bear stearn and thei sai __PUNCT__ thi is social capit __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ what we have is that the privat compani get to make all the profit __PUNCT__
when thei get in troubl __PUNCT__ the govern step in __PUNCT__
is that right __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it not right __PUNCT__
but we reach such a situat that __PUNCT__ if these institut fail __PUNCT__ the impact on million of innoc american could be veri sever __PUNCT__
in the case of fanni and freddi __PUNCT__ we should stop their lobbi activ __PUNCT__
we should elimin the pai and bonus that these peopl rake in __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ georg will ha an idea on that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ the most __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ he sai that when some place like freddi mae __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__ or fanni mae or bear stearn get the govern guarante __PUNCT__ that the execut that work there should get a govern salari __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
that exactli right __PUNCT__
and we could go out and ask peopl __PUNCT__ the smartest peopl in america __PUNCT__ mayb somebodi like jack welch or john chamber or meg whitman __PUNCT__ peopl like that __PUNCT__ and sai __PUNCT__ come and take over and do it for __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
thei be will to do that __PUNCT__
but the other thing is __PUNCT__ the sharehold should not be the first on to be paid __PUNCT__
there should be new prefer stock issu __PUNCT__
and those peopl would be __PUNCT__ and the govern __PUNCT__ paid off first __PUNCT__ sinc the govern is on the hook __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ and should the govern get some stock __PUNCT__ so that if fanni mae doe recov __PUNCT__ the taxpay should benefit __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
absolut __PUNCT__ thei should __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__
and we got to send the signal that __PUNCT__ over time __PUNCT__ that these kind of institut have not help the american homeown __PUNCT__
