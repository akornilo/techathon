i will confront the ten trillion __PUNCT__ dollar debt that the feder govern ha run up __PUNCT__ and balanc the feder budget by the end of my term in offic __PUNCT__
thi is the agenda i have set befor my fellow citizen __PUNCT__
and the same standard of clariti and candor must now be appli to my oppon __PUNCT__
we have all heard what he ha said __PUNCT__ but it is less clear what he ha done or what he will do __PUNCT__
what senat obama sai todai and what he ha done in the past ar often two differ thing __PUNCT__
rather than answer hi critic __PUNCT__ senat obama will try to distract you from notic that he never answer the seriou and legitim question he ha been ask __PUNCT__
he ha even question my truth __PUNCT__
and let me repli in the plainest term i know __PUNCT__
i don't need lesson about tell the truth to american peopl __PUNCT__
and were i ever to need ani improv in that regard __PUNCT__ i probabl wouldn't seek advic from a chicago politician __PUNCT__
what wa my oppon actual record in the year befor the great econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ thi crisi start in our hous market in the form of subprim loan that were push on peopl who could not afford them __PUNCT__
bad mortgag were be back by fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and it wa onli a matter of time befor a contagion of unsustain debt began to spread __PUNCT__
thi corrupt wa encourag by democrat in congress __PUNCT__ and abet by senat obama __PUNCT__
i wa the on who call at the time for tighter restrict on fanni mae and freddi mac that could have help prevent thi crisi from happen in the first place __PUNCT__
and senat obama wa silent on the regul of fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ and hi democrat alli in congress oppos everi effort to rein them in __PUNCT__
as recent as __DATE__ of last year he said that subprim loan had been __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ a good idea __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ good idea __PUNCT__ ha now plung thi countri into the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
to hear him talk now __PUNCT__ you think he alwai oppos the danger practic at these institut __PUNCT__
but there is absolut noth in hi record to suggest he did __PUNCT__
he wa sure familiar with the peopl who were creat thi problem __PUNCT__
the execut of fanni mae and freddi mac have advis him __PUNCT__ and he ha taken their monei for hi campaign __PUNCT__
he ha receiv more monei from fanni mae and freddi mac than ani other senat in histori __PUNCT__ with the except of the chairman of the committe overse them __PUNCT__
did he ever talk to the execut at fanni and freddi about these reckless loan __PUNCT__ did he ever discuss with them the stronger oversight i propos __PUNCT__ if senat obama is such a champion of financi regul __PUNCT__ why didn't he support these regul that could have prevent thi crisi in the first place __PUNCT__ he won't tell you __PUNCT__ but you deserv an answer __PUNCT__
on health care __PUNCT__ barack obama ha been mislead on two front __PUNCT__
offhand __PUNCT__ it hard to sai which health __PUNCT__ care propos he ha misrepres the most __PUNCT__ hi own or mine __PUNCT__
he ha said that hi goal is a singl payer system where govern is in charg of health care __PUNCT__
under the plan he ha propos __PUNCT__ he will fine employ who do not offer health insur and put their employe in govern health care __PUNCT__
what he doesn't sai __PUNCT__ and what nobodi ha ask __PUNCT__ is how big hi fine will be __PUNCT__
you deserv an answer __PUNCT__ and you sure didn't get on last night __PUNCT__
again on tax __PUNCT__ we see a differ between what senat obama sai todai __PUNCT__ what he said yesterdai __PUNCT__ and what he ha actual done __PUNCT__
dure the democrat primari __PUNCT__ he promis to doubl tax on everi american with a dividend or an invest __PUNCT__
he promis to rais payrol tax __PUNCT__
he promis higher tax on electr __PUNCT__
and now all of the sudden senat obama claim he will give __NUM__ percent of american tax relief __PUNCT__
what he hasn't told you is that he would tax half of the incom of small busi in america __PUNCT__
these ar the peopl who have actual ad __NUM__ job at a time when america lost __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
thei ar the backbon of our economi __PUNCT__ and our best hope to get america back on track __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ their tax ar go down instead of up __PUNCT__ and we go to help them creat job for america __PUNCT__
barack obama got a record on tax increas that he doesn't talk about veri much __PUNCT__
he vote for the democrat budget resolut that promis to rais tax on peopl make just __NUM__ dollar a year __PUNCT__
at the time __PUNCT__ he even said hi vote wa intend to get __PUNCT__ our nation prioriti back on track __PUNCT__
so if he such a defend of the middl class __PUNCT__ why did he vote to rais their tax __PUNCT__ whatev happen to the tax relief he promis them when he wa a candid for the senat __PUNCT__ and why should middl class american trust him to keep promis he ha alreadi broken __PUNCT__ senat obama and i both have differ with how presid bush ha handl the economi __PUNCT__
but he think tax ar too low __PUNCT__ and i think spend is too high __PUNCT__
accord to third parti estim __PUNCT__ barack obama will increas govern spend by over __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
that on top of the trillion in debt that we alreadi burden our children and grandchildren with __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ i cut the size of govern __PUNCT__
i will put the govern back on the side of america work famili __PUNCT__ and i will get thi countri move again __PUNCT__
then there the matter of earmark __PUNCT__
in hi three short year in the senat __PUNCT__ he ha request nearli a billion dollar in pork project for hi state __PUNCT__ a million dollar for everi dai he been in offic __PUNCT__
far from fight earmark in congress __PUNCT__ senat obama ha been an eager particip in thi corrupt system __PUNCT__
last night i mention the exampl of the more than __NUM__ million dollar he sought for a new projector at a planetarium in hi hometown __PUNCT__
coincident __PUNCT__ the chairman of that planetarium pledg to rais more than __MONEY__ for senat obama campaign __PUNCT__
we don't know if thei ever discuss the monei for the planetarium __PUNCT__ and no on ha ask senat obama __PUNCT__
but even the appear of thi kind of insid __PUNCT__ deal disgust american __PUNCT__
i go to put a stop to that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ if i presid __PUNCT__
who is the real senat obama __PUNCT__ is he the candid who promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__ or the politician who vote to rais middl class tax __PUNCT__ is he the candid who talk about regul or the politician who took monei from fanni mae and freddi mac and turn a blind ey as thei ran our economi into a ditch __PUNCT__ is he the candid who promis chang __PUNCT__ or is he the politician who ha bought into everyth that is wrong with washington __PUNCT__ we can't chang the system with someon who never fought the system __PUNCT__
washington is on the wrong track and i go to set it right __PUNCT__
the american peopl know my record __PUNCT__
thei know i am go to chang washington __PUNCT__ becaus i done it befor __PUNCT__
thei know i go to reform our broken institut in washington and on wall street becaus i done it befor __PUNCT__
thei know i go to deliv relief to the middl class __PUNCT__ becaus that what i done __PUNCT__
you don't have to hope that thing will chang when you vote for me __PUNCT__
you know thing will chang __PUNCT__ becaus i have been fight for chang in washington my whole career __PUNCT__
i been fight for you my whole life __PUNCT__
that what i go to do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
fight for you and put the govern back on the side of the peopl __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
