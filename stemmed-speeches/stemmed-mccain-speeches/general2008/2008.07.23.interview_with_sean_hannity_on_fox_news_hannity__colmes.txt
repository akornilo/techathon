mccain __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ sean __PUNCT__
good to be with you again __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ appreci you spend sometim with us __PUNCT__
first question is __PUNCT__ how mani time have you been to iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ eight time and sever time to afghanistan __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ and i tri to go period __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ and more recent __PUNCT__ i guess __PUNCT__ it wa march __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ and how mani time ha kati couric __PUNCT__ and charli gibson __PUNCT__ and brian william been with you __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ not often __PUNCT__ but it is what it is __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let me ask you about that __PUNCT__ becaus thi is barack obama __PUNCT__
he is your oppon __PUNCT__ and hi first trip ever to afghanistan __PUNCT__ hasn't been back to iraq in __NUM__ some odd dai __PUNCT__ and the three major network and their big star out there to cover thi __PUNCT__
doe that bother you at all __PUNCT__ is that __PUNCT__ what do you think of that __PUNCT__ is that media bia __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ on of the thing that veri interest __PUNCT__ he had never befor ask to sit down and get a brief from gener petraeu __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ and the other thing i thought wa interest __PUNCT__ he issu hi polici statement toward iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ which as you mention never been to __PUNCT__ befor he left __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ sean __PUNCT__
i travel around the world __PUNCT__ usual at your expens __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ at my expens __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ but i make my polici statement and speech after i learn along the wai __PUNCT__ so it pretti clear that senat obama wa not go to chang hi wrong view that the success had not succeed __PUNCT__ and the fact is it ha succeed __PUNCT__ and we win __PUNCT__ and he refus to acknowledg that __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he __PUNCT__ actual up until the week befor he had on hi web site that the surg wasn't work __PUNCT__ and then thei purg that part of it __PUNCT__ and thei talk about the minor success __PUNCT__ but he still won't admit that the surg ha been success __PUNCT__
is that just a polit postur __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no ration person who wa in iraq two year ago and saw the situat __PUNCT__ and it wa dire then __PUNCT__
we were on the verg of lose a war __PUNCT__ and see it now __PUNCT__ no ration person cannot sai that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__ and there on other thing about thi __PUNCT__
it make you just marvel and stand in aw of the young men and women who did all thi __PUNCT__
our servic member __PUNCT__ there were polit pundit that you and i like and admir that said it wa lost __PUNCT__
harri reid __PUNCT__ the major leader of the senat __PUNCT__ it wa lost __PUNCT__
and yet these young peopl under the inspir leadership of gener petraeu and other __PUNCT__ and other went out there __PUNCT__ and thei succe in thi thing __PUNCT__ and it __PUNCT__ what a testimoni it is to the brave men and women __PUNCT__ and when you sai it wasn't becaus of them __PUNCT__ then i think it a disservic to them __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ you had some veri strong thing to sai in the last coupl of dai as it relat to thi and to senat barack obama __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ just befor he went on thi trip __PUNCT__ hi web site said the surg is not work __PUNCT__ now it sai __PUNCT__ he talk about the improv secur in iraq __PUNCT__
but you said __PUNCT__ if he had hi wai __PUNCT__ we would have lost __PUNCT__ that it would have been a catastroph __PUNCT__ he wa wrong then __PUNCT__ he wrong now __PUNCT__ and still cannot acknowledg the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__ and then you went on to sai __PUNCT__ i would rather lose a polit campaign than lose a war __PUNCT__
but obama would rather lose a war than a polit campaign __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ but let me sai again __PUNCT__ thi surg __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ i support it when it wasn't popular __PUNCT__
i wa even call by republican for be disloy becaus i fought against the fail strategi of nearli four year __PUNCT__
and as you also well recal __PUNCT__ there were time when my campaign wa declar dead and buri __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ i rememb __PUNCT__ on summer __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ but i did what i thought wa right for the __PUNCT__ i knew wa right for the countri becaus of my background and experi and knowledg and judgment __PUNCT__
senat obama rail against __PUNCT__ fought against __PUNCT__ he want __PUNCT__ he vote to cut off fund for the troop in iraq __PUNCT__ and still will not acknowledg that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
so no ration person could look at the situat in iraq on the ground and that been there two year ago and sai that the surg hasn't succeed __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ so it clear to me that there must be polit calcul in hi judgment becaus no ration observ could conclud anyth els __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ but he had set a timet __PUNCT__ __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ and then he talk about __PUNCT__ just prior to the tip __PUNCT__ that he refin hi posit and that he would listen to the gener on the ground __PUNCT__
he got a lot of heat from the left wing __PUNCT__ and then he immedi switch back to that posit __PUNCT__
so then he goe on thi trip with a predetermin outcom in term of where hi posit is go to be __PUNCT__
what doe that mean to you in term of hi qualif to be the command in chief and the next presid __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let me point out that also hi __PUNCT__ dure the primari if we have done what he want to do __PUNCT__ the troop would have been out last march __PUNCT__
last march __PUNCT__ thei would have been gone __PUNCT__
we have never given the surg a chanc to succe __PUNCT__
the thing that disturb me is we know that afghanistan is a major challeng __PUNCT__ but the same strategi that succeed in iraq ha to be emploi in afghanistan __PUNCT__
gener petraeu __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ is the architect of that __PUNCT__ along with some other brave and wonder peopl __PUNCT__
so if you didn't learn the lesson of how we were abl to succe in iraq and ar win the war and he won't transfer that to afghanistan and other counter insurg __PUNCT__ what thi is __PUNCT__ is basic a counterinsurg surg __PUNCT__
and it ha a lot more to do with troop __PUNCT__ than troop level __PUNCT__
it ha to do with win __PUNCT__ with hold and win in neighborhood and stai there __PUNCT__ and secur __PUNCT__ and normal live go forward and all of that __PUNCT__
it a part of a counterinsurg strategi __PUNCT__
if he refus to acknowledg that it succeed in iraq __PUNCT__ what would be hi plan for afghanistan which is a veri complex and difficult challeng __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ i want to talk about that __PUNCT__
i want to go back to that in a second __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ but i want to go back to the media question here for just a second __PUNCT__
barack obama had an op __PUNCT__ ed publish in the __PUNCT__ new york time __PUNCT__
you want to have your op __PUNCT__ ed publish in the __PUNCT__ new york time __PUNCT__
it wa reject __PUNCT__ and thei sent you a note sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if your would mirror __PUNCT__ wa the term that thei us __PUNCT__ that of barack obama thei would consid publish it __PUNCT__
now i been sai __PUNCT__ and my audienc know i conserv __PUNCT__ we mai look at __NUM__ as the year that journal di in america __PUNCT__
but you been there eight time __PUNCT__ you don't have the major network with you __PUNCT__ you don't have the __PUNCT__ new york time __PUNCT__ offer reciproc __PUNCT__
what doe that mean in term of media coverag in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i know you laugh __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ all i can do is be amus __PUNCT__
it is what it is __PUNCT__
sean __PUNCT__ you know veri well that if anybodi complain __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that just non __PUNCT__ product __PUNCT__
i happi with where our campaign is __PUNCT__
we ar veri close in the poll __PUNCT__
i happi with how we been do __PUNCT__
i look forward the convent and the two month follow __PUNCT__
i convinc we can win thi race __PUNCT__
i the underdog __PUNCT__ i got a lot of work to do __PUNCT__ but i proud of our campaign __PUNCT__ and i convinc that we can get direct to the american peopl __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ even if scott rasmussen ha a poll __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of american think the media is try to help barack obama win __PUNCT__
onli __NUM__ percent think thei try to help you win __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar veri wise __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ i want to stai on foreign polici for just a second here __PUNCT__
i did notic he __PUNCT__ at on time __PUNCT__ said we air __PUNCT__ raid villag and kill civilian __PUNCT__ talk about afghanistan __PUNCT__
he onc said it would be a profound mistak under ani circumst to us nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
he onc talk about invad an alli __PUNCT__ pakistan __PUNCT__
he onc refer to iran __PUNCT__ cuba __PUNCT__ and venezuela __PUNCT__ thei tini countri __PUNCT__ thei not a seriou threat __PUNCT__ and then he said __PUNCT__ although he chang as of todai __PUNCT__ the issu of ahmadinejad that he would meet without precondit __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ all i can sai is that senat obama doe not have ani background on these issu __PUNCT__ and i would hope that he would do hi best to learn __PUNCT__
on of the reason why i encourag him to go to iraq __PUNCT__
i didn't know he would issu a polici statement the dai befor he left __PUNCT__ but i think the american peopl ar most concern about our economi __PUNCT__ that i know we go to talk about __PUNCT__ and ga price __PUNCT__ but thei also want the peac __PUNCT__
i can win the peac __PUNCT__
i know how to win war __PUNCT__
i hate war __PUNCT__
no on understand war and the tragedi of it better than the veteran who feel the keen loss of a comrad __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ most keenli the loss of a comrad __PUNCT__
and so i believ that american peopl will take that in to consider __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ thei will take into consider senat obama judgment about iraq and the brave young men and women to not applaud their success and their strategi __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ american don't agre with him __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ we move on for just a second __PUNCT__
report that you ar close to choos your vice presid __PUNCT__
is that true __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ we have said exactli the same thing all along __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ sean __PUNCT__ that we make the decis when we make it __PUNCT__

on of the toughest decis a presid make is set prioriti __PUNCT__ and so that ha to be __PUNCT__ those obvious import characterist __PUNCT__ and on of them __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is someon who can take your place immedi __PUNCT__
that mayb view by some as even more import in my case __PUNCT__

but i want to convinc the american peopl that i can inspir a gener of american to serv a caus greater than their self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ as you well know and our viewer know __PUNCT__ trust and confid in washington is at it lowest level __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent approv rate of congress __PUNCT__
complet gridlock __PUNCT__
__NUM__ percent of the american peopl think the countri on the wrong track __PUNCT__
we got to inspir them again and show them that america best dai ar ahead of us which is someth i profoundli believ __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i know becaus everywher i go peopl talk to me about the high price of a gallon of gasolin and the impact that it have on their live __PUNCT__ the economi __PUNCT__ their famili __PUNCT__ and most american ar angri when thei find out that we have more resourc here in the unit state that we not tap into __PUNCT__
i even argu that we have a clear and present danger face the unit state __PUNCT__ the possibl of an energi war __PUNCT__
am i overst the case __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
we ar send __MONEY__ billion a year oversea to countri that don't like us veri much __PUNCT__
some of that monei end up in the hand of terrorist organ __PUNCT__
it on of the greatest transfer of wealth in histori __PUNCT__
you ar exactli on the mark __PUNCT__ and i think american ar begin to figur it out __PUNCT__
of cours we have to drill offshor __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we have to exploit everi mean we have of bridg thi gap while we make the transit to energi independ __PUNCT__
i view a new automobil the other dai call the volt __PUNCT__
i prai it succe __PUNCT__
it could revolution the automobil industri __PUNCT__
and i want to just mention __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ we all love wind __PUNCT__ tide __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ all that __PUNCT__ nuclear power __PUNCT__ nuclear power __PUNCT__
the french can build a nuclear power plant in five year __PUNCT__
we should build __NUM__ nuclear power plant by __NUM__ and that will creat __NUM__ job __PUNCT__ and it clean __PUNCT__
senat obama oppos offshor drill __PUNCT__ he oppos nuclear __PUNCT__ he oppos __PUNCT__ ga tax holidai __PUNCT__ he oppos give an award for a real batteri __PUNCT__ driven car __PUNCT__
so he dr __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ and coal __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ and coal __PUNCT__
and we got to invest __MONEY__ billion a year in pure research and develop in clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
we ar sit on the world largest suppli of energi in the form of coal reserv __PUNCT__
we got to have clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ you have come under some scrutini and critic becaus you chang your posit on offshor drill __PUNCT__ and my question to you is would you consid chang that posit on anwr __PUNCT__ there noth there __PUNCT__
it onli on of the __NUM__ million acr __PUNCT__
thei onli us __NUM__ of them for explor __PUNCT__
do you think you reconsid in light of the high price of ga __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i will look at everyth __PUNCT__
i still don't believ it call the nation wildlif refug __PUNCT__ but on the offshor drill __PUNCT__ i alwai said that it left up to the state __PUNCT__
it still left up to the state __PUNCT__ but it is also import as far as the price of a barrel of oil is concern __PUNCT__
you know when the presid made the announc that we were go to lift the feder moratorium __PUNCT__ which wasn't that big a deal __PUNCT__ the price of oil drop __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
so those peopl that said just tell __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ a barrel __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ excus __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__
and the peopl that said that we couldn't affect the price of a barrel of oil were wrong __PUNCT__ becaus if we tell the world we go to have our own reserv __PUNCT__ and we not go to be depend as we make thi transit to independ __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ that it will matter as far as the price of a barrel of oil is concern __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ and i confid that an oil execut sai __PUNCT__ and i hope you have on on your program __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ or an expert __PUNCT__ thei tell me that we could get some of thi oil within a year or two __PUNCT__
that not __PUNCT__ it not thi __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ two year __PUNCT__ outer continent shelf __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ eighti __PUNCT__ six billion barrel of oil ar avail there __PUNCT__
you know thi ha got to be a defin issu __PUNCT__
if you ar for nuclear energi __PUNCT__ barack obama is against it __PUNCT__
you for a suspens of the ga tax __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ off shore drill __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ he __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ he against that __PUNCT__
you for offshor __PUNCT__ he against that __PUNCT__
you for expand coal mine __PUNCT__ he is against that __PUNCT__
these ar major differ in the campaign __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i think thei ar major differ __PUNCT__ and i think if you __PUNCT__ and i love for you to sometim come to a town hall meet with me as i just had __PUNCT__
when you sai to an audienc i think we have to drill offshor and exploit our resourc there __PUNCT__ thei stand and applaud __PUNCT__
thei get it __PUNCT__
american peopl __PUNCT__ sometim we don't give them quit as much credit as thei deserv for know what go on __PUNCT__
thei know we got to be independ of foreign oil __PUNCT__
thei know that we have to go to nuclear power __PUNCT__
thei know these thing __PUNCT__ and thei care __PUNCT__ and it matter __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ let me ask you thi __PUNCT__
there been a lot made about your oppon __PUNCT__ let sai __PUNCT__ shift posit __PUNCT__
i could run through my list __PUNCT__ but my __PUNCT__ i be in troubl with my boss __PUNCT__ so i got to be care becaus i brought it up quit often __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ on mani __PUNCT__ most of the major issu that he ran on __PUNCT__ in the nomin process against hillari clinton __PUNCT__ he now shift fairli dramat __PUNCT__
so my question to you is __PUNCT__ what doe that sai to you about barack obama as a person __PUNCT__ about miss charact __PUNCT__ about who he is __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think the american peopl want straight talk __PUNCT__
i think the reason why i the nomine of the parti is becaus i went to place and told them thing thei didn't want to know as well as what thei want to know __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i think the american peopl ar awar of thi __PUNCT__ and i think it will impact their judgment __PUNCT__
i got to stick to my posit __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__ and i know that some of them aren't popular __PUNCT__ but at least american right now sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i mai not agre with thi gui __PUNCT__ but at least i know where he come from __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ let me ask you thi __PUNCT__
senat obama actual took a shot at littl old sean hanniti recent __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i saw that __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ did you see that __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i saw that __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ he said if you start be subject to rant by sean hanniti and the like dai in and out __PUNCT__ that will drive up your neg __PUNCT__
and he wa talk about my critic of michel obama comment __PUNCT__
now michel obama wa quot as sai america is a downright mean countri in __NUM__ and for the first time in her adult life she is proud of her countri __PUNCT__
is that fair game __PUNCT__ is that fair __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__ sean __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ i love to see famili kept out of the polit arena __PUNCT__
i understand what the natur of polit todai __PUNCT__ but i love to see all of our famili complet out of the polit discuss if i could __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ what about the radic associ __PUNCT__ we spent a lot of time __PUNCT__
reverend wright __PUNCT__ toni rezko __PUNCT__ william ayer __PUNCT__ father pfleger __PUNCT__
we discuss a lot of these associ in detail __PUNCT__
when you coupl that with mayb those comment he made in san francisco when he us the term __PUNCT__ bitter american __PUNCT__ in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ cling to their gun __PUNCT__ religion __PUNCT__ with antipathi to those who aren't like them __PUNCT__ doe that reveal a lot about senat obama __PUNCT__ hi judgment __PUNCT__ you been __PUNCT__ you seem reluct to bring these thing up __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ in the case of mr __PUNCT__ ayer __PUNCT__ anybodi who said that he sorri that he didn't bomb more __PUNCT__ and in that kind of a close relationship __PUNCT__ that kind of person i think ha to be reject __PUNCT__
i think also that we want to campaign as much in a most respect fashion __PUNCT__
i admir senat obama for what he been abl to accomplish __PUNCT__
i respect the enorm victori that he won over a veri tough oppon in senat clinton who i also happen to admir __PUNCT__
but i think that american care veri much about what we go to do for them __PUNCT__ but i also think thei go to judg our record __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ but right now thei hurt veri badli __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ and thei want a concret set of propos __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ for energi independ __PUNCT__
that what thei want to hear right now __PUNCT__
