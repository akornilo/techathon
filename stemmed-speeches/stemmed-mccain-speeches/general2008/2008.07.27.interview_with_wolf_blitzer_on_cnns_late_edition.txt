i know how to do it __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ if you captur him aliv __PUNCT__ what do you do with him __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ of cours you put him on trial __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ there ar ampl preced of __PUNCT__ for that __PUNCT__
and it might be a good thing to reveal to the world the enorm of thi gui crime and hi intent __PUNCT__ which ar still there __PUNCT__
and he work night and dai to destroi everyth we stand for and believ in __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ do you do him a regular civilian trial here in the unit state or is it a war crime tribun __PUNCT__ a militari commiss __PUNCT__ what kind of legal justic would you bring him toward __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ we have variou option __PUNCT__ but the nuremburg trial ar certainli an exampl of the kind of tribun that we could move forward with __PUNCT__
i don't think we have ani difficulti devis an intern __PUNCT__ an internation support mechan that would mete out justic __PUNCT__
and there no problem there __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ let talk about the war in iraq right now __PUNCT__
charl krauthamm __PUNCT__ the washington post conserv columnist __PUNCT__ he write that the prime minist of iraq __PUNCT__ nouri al __PUNCT__ maliki __PUNCT__ in recent dai __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ vote for obama __PUNCT__ cast the earliest and most ostentati absente ballot of thi presidenti elect __PUNCT__
if you were presid and nouri al __PUNCT__ maliki is still the elect prime minist of iraq __PUNCT__ and he sai he want all u. __PUNCT__ troop out __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i know prime minist maliki rather well __PUNCT__
i know that he is a politician __PUNCT__ and i know that thei ar look at upcom elect __PUNCT__
i know that he know and everi __PUNCT__ and the other leader know there that it ha to be condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__
ani withdraw __PUNCT__ which we will withdraw __PUNCT__
we have succeed __PUNCT__
the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
and we on the road to victori __PUNCT__
and we will be out of there __PUNCT__
and we mai have a residu presenc of some kind __PUNCT__ as i alwai said __PUNCT__ but the fact is __PUNCT__ the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
and the fundament here is that i support that surg when it wa not the popular thing to do __PUNCT__
senat obama oppos it __PUNCT__ said it wouldn't work __PUNCT__ even vote to cut off the fund for the men and women who ar fight over there __PUNCT__ and still __PUNCT__ and he still doesn't understand to the point where he doesn't agre that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
no ration observ __PUNCT__ no ration observ who see the condit in iraq todai as oppos to two year ago could possibl __PUNCT__ could possibl conclud that the surg hasn't succeed __PUNCT__
so he see it as a polit issu __PUNCT__
he doesn't understand the import of thi victori __PUNCT__ and the consequ of failur __PUNCT__ and the benefit of success __PUNCT__
if we had done what senat obama want to do __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ initi would have been the troop out last march __PUNCT__ we would had greater iranian influenc __PUNCT__ we would have had an increas in sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ we would have seen possibl a wider war in the region __PUNCT__ which would have drawn us back __PUNCT__
so i can assur you that prime minist maliki understand that condit have to be kept __PUNCT__
and i want to find __PUNCT__ tell you again __PUNCT__ gener petraeu __PUNCT__ on of the great gener in histori __PUNCT__ strongli disagre with senat obama __PUNCT__
and our highest __PUNCT__ rank militari offic also sai it would be a veri danger cours __PUNCT__
we not go to go down that road __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ but if maliki persist __PUNCT__ you presid __PUNCT__ and he sai he want u. __PUNCT__ troop out and he want them out __PUNCT__ let sai __PUNCT__ in a year or two year or __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ or whatev __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ do you just __PUNCT__ do you listen to the prime minist __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ he won't __PUNCT__
he won't __PUNCT__
he won't __PUNCT__ becaus he __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ how do you know __PUNCT__ how do you know __PUNCT__ how do you know that __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__
know that it ha to be condit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__
becaus i know him __PUNCT__ and i know him veri well __PUNCT__
and i know the other leader __PUNCT__
and i know __PUNCT__ i been there eight time __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__
and i know them veri __PUNCT__ veri well __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ so why do you think he said __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and the point is __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ why do you think he said that __NUM__ month is basic a pretti good timet __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ he said it a pretti good timet base on condit on the ground __PUNCT__
i think it a pretti good timet __PUNCT__ as we should __PUNCT__ or horizon for withdraw __PUNCT__
but thei have to be base on condit on the ground __PUNCT__
thi success is veri fragil __PUNCT__
it incred impress __PUNCT__ but veri fragil __PUNCT__
so we know __PUNCT__ those of us who have been involv in it for mani year know that __PUNCT__ if we revers thi by set a date for withdraw __PUNCT__ all of the hard __PUNCT__ won victori can be revers __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ we not readi to do that __PUNCT__
too mani brave young american and their famili have sacrif too much __PUNCT__
but we will be out __PUNCT__ and the differ is __PUNCT__ we be out with victori and honor and not defeat __PUNCT__
senat obama ha said there a possibl __PUNCT__ under hi plan __PUNCT__ we mai have to go back __PUNCT__
i guarante you __PUNCT__ after thei withdraw under what we ar do __PUNCT__ we never have to go back __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you also made a veri seriou charg against senat obama __PUNCT__
you repeat it __PUNCT__
you sai you stand by it __PUNCT__ that he would rather lose a war to win a polit campaign __PUNCT__ rais question about __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ hi motiv __PUNCT__
joe klein __PUNCT__ write in time magazin __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ thi is the ninth presidenti campaign i cover __PUNCT__
i can't rememb a more scurril statement by a major parti candid __PUNCT__
it smack of desper __PUNCT__
those ar pretti strong word from joe klein __PUNCT__ whom you obvious know __PUNCT__
but tell us __PUNCT__
what ar you charg __PUNCT__ what ar you accus obama of do __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i am accus __PUNCT__ i am state the fact __PUNCT__ and the fact ar that i don't question senat obama patriot __PUNCT__
i sure that he a veri patriot american __PUNCT__
i question hi judgment becaus he lack experi and knowledg __PUNCT__ and i question hi judgment __PUNCT__
i not prepar to see the sacrific of so mani brave young american lost becaus senat obama just view thi war as anoth polit issu which he can chang posit __PUNCT__
and everybodi know that he wa abl to obtain the nomin of hi parti by appeal to the far left and commit to a cours of action that i believ wa __PUNCT__ i know wa wrong becaus he said the surg would not work __PUNCT__
he said it wouldn't succe __PUNCT__
no ration observ in iraq todai believ that the surg did not succe __PUNCT__
so he just treat it as anoth polit issu becaus he doesn't understand and he doesn't have the knowledg and the background to make the kind of judgment that ar necessari __PUNCT__
and thi war ha enorm ramif __PUNCT__
if we had lost it __PUNCT__ we would have face enorm champ in the region __PUNCT__ throughout the world __PUNCT__ increas iranian influenc __PUNCT__ perhap even have to come back in a wider war __PUNCT__
so he simpli doe not understand and treat it as anoth polit issu __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but he sai that __PUNCT__ when it come to judgment back in __NUM__ and __NUM__ earli __NUM__ befor the war __PUNCT__ he made the right call in oppos the war to begin with __PUNCT__ and he sai you blunder __PUNCT__ you made the wrong call in support go to war against saddam hussein __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i be more than happi to go through all of that again __PUNCT__ and historian will __PUNCT__
the fact is that saddam hussein wa bent on the develop of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ and i be glad to discuss that __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ what did we do at a critic time __PUNCT__ when we were about to lose the war __PUNCT__ we were lose the war __PUNCT__
senat obama want to get out __PUNCT__
i want the surg __PUNCT__ which wa not popular __PUNCT__
the surg work __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ what do we do in the futur __PUNCT__ do we continu on the path to victori __PUNCT__ and we succeed __PUNCT__ or do we set a time for withdraw and jeopard and possibl revers all the gain that we have made __PUNCT__ that the question on the mind of the american peopl todai __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ we invit our viewer __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ to submit some video question for you __PUNCT__ sort of __PUNCT__ our video version of a town hall meet __PUNCT__

and it not over __PUNCT__ as i said __PUNCT__
al qaida is not defeat __PUNCT__
thei ar on their heel __PUNCT__ but thei not defeat __PUNCT__
that why we have a wai to go __PUNCT__ but the progress __PUNCT__ by ani paramet __PUNCT__ ha been dramat good __PUNCT__

do i favor pre __PUNCT__ emptiv war __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
