senat obama plan would cut tax more than mccain for the middl class __PUNCT__ but obama would rais tax for those make more than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and last week __PUNCT__ mccain turn up the temperatur on the rhetor __PUNCT__

pellei __PUNCT__ you and senat obama propos cut tax in differ wai __PUNCT__
but in the last few dai the feder deficit broke all record __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ it now __MONEY__ billion that the feder govern is in the red __PUNCT__
is it smart to cut tax for anyon in thi econom emerg with that kind of a deficit __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ scott __PUNCT__ the worst thing you could do is rais tax on anybodi __PUNCT__
and i don't know which iter we ar talk about of senat obama __PUNCT__
he had four or five differ posit on which tax he would increas __PUNCT__ which on he wouldn't __PUNCT__
i think the major point here is that spend got out of control __PUNCT__
how mani american know that the size of govern increas by __NUM__ percent in the last seven year __PUNCT__ we republican for six of the eight year presid over the greatest increas in govern sinc the great societi __PUNCT__
republican came to power to chang washington __PUNCT__

earli in the campaign __PUNCT__ mccain told a report that the economi wasn't hi strong suit __PUNCT__
the obama campaign pick that up __PUNCT__
pellei didn't ask about that quot __PUNCT__ but it wa clear in thi interview that he still sore about it __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ you not an expert on the economi __PUNCT__
senat obama is not an expert on the economi __PUNCT__
so let me ask you what trait would you bring to the oval offic that would help navig thi countri out of the current emerg __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ never complain __PUNCT__ but mayb i can explain __PUNCT__
that statement about me and the economi wa made in the context of a long convers __PUNCT__
moral of the stori is __PUNCT__ don't have long convers __PUNCT__ especi with __NUM__ minut __PUNCT__
point is __PUNCT__ no serious __PUNCT__ is that i understand the economi as chairman of the commerc committe __PUNCT__ which oversight all of the commerci aspect of america economi __PUNCT__
i been involv in these issu for mani __PUNCT__ mani year __PUNCT__
i know the economi __PUNCT__
i know how to fix it __PUNCT__
there were a number of surpris in our interview __PUNCT__ includ mccain first mention of a radic chang he sai he would make in the white hous __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i would move the polit offic out of the white hous and into the republican nation committe __PUNCT__
i think we gotta have a white hous that is without polit __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ but the model of the last coupl of administr ha been to have a polit offic in the west wing with the presid __PUNCT__ karl rove in the bush administr __PUNCT__ and to carri on a perman campaign __PUNCT__
the white hous is alwai campaign __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ it time to show the american peopl that polit will not be part of thi massiv effort we gonna have to go on to restor our nation economi __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ senat obama call you presid bush third term __PUNCT__
what ar the differ between you and presid bush __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ spend __PUNCT__ conduct of the war in iraq __PUNCT__ climat chang __PUNCT__ treatment of prison __PUNCT__ 9/11 commiss __PUNCT__
there is a larg number of issu that i have stood up to my parti __PUNCT__ not just the white hous but to my parti __PUNCT__
senat obama ha never onc done that __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ what ar the sharpest differ between you and senat obama __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ work in a bipartisan fashion which american want us to do now __PUNCT__
but most importantli __PUNCT__ he want to increas spend __PUNCT__
and he want to rais tax __PUNCT__
a fundament philosoph differ between the most liber member of the unit state senat __PUNCT__ accord to hi vote record __PUNCT__ and someon who i am __PUNCT__ a proud conserv principl unit state senat __PUNCT__
but on of the biggest area of disagr final __PUNCT__ could i just sai __PUNCT__ wa over iraq __PUNCT__
iraq wa nearli the end of the mccain campaign __PUNCT__
__NUM__ minut went there with mccain shortli after the surg wa announc __PUNCT__ when more than __NUM__ percent of the american peopl were against it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i believ that we can succe and i believ that the consequ of failur ar catastroph __PUNCT__
those who sai just withdraw then you sai what next __PUNCT__ mccain said at the time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i wonder at what point do you stop do what you think is right and you start do what the major of the american peopl want __PUNCT__ pellei ask the senat __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i disagre with what the major of the american peopl want __PUNCT__
failur will lead to chao __PUNCT__ withdraw will lead to chao __PUNCT__ mccain repli __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mani polit pundit said my campaign wa over __PUNCT__
senat obama move to the left of hi parti and said we shouldn't __PUNCT__ said the surg would fail __PUNCT__ said it wa doom to failur __PUNCT__ and still fail to acknowledg that he wa wrong about the surg __PUNCT__
the surg wa a gambl back when mccain wa low on support __PUNCT__ out of monei and expect to fail __PUNCT__
it success help captur the nomin that onc seem so improb __PUNCT__

he didn't have to sai her last name __PUNCT__ sarah palin celebr ha overshadow hi __PUNCT__ even though she mai be a gambl as riski as the surg __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ the critic of governor palin is that she wa a brilliant market choic for the campaign __PUNCT__ but she not well vers on the economi or foreign affair __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ the most popular governor in america so __PUNCT__ and the largest geograph state __PUNCT__
but the most import thing is __PUNCT__
pellei __PUNCT__ but foreign affair and the economi __PUNCT__ those ar thing that peopl ar concern about __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ anybodi who govern a state ha some econom experi __PUNCT__
