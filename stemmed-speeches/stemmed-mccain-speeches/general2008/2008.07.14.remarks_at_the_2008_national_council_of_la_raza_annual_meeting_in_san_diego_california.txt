over __NUM__ peopl have lost their job sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and the rate of new job creation ha fallen sharpli __PUNCT__
american ar worri about the secur of their current job __PUNCT__ and thei worri that thei __PUNCT__ their kid and their neighbor mai not find good job and new opportun in the futur __PUNCT__
to make matter wors __PUNCT__ ga is over __MONEY__ a gallon and the price of oil ha nearli doubl in the last year __PUNCT__
the cost of everyth from energi to food is rise __PUNCT__
i have a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__ creat more and better job __PUNCT__ and get america move again __PUNCT__
i have a plan to reform govern __PUNCT__ achiev energi secur __PUNCT__ and ensur that healthcar and a qualiti educ ar afford and avail for all __PUNCT__
i believ the role of govern is to unleash the creativ __PUNCT__ ingenu and hard work of the american peopl __PUNCT__ and make it easier to creat job __PUNCT__
at it core __PUNCT__ the economi isn't the sum of an arrai of bewild statist __PUNCT__
it about where american work __PUNCT__ how thei live __PUNCT__ how thei pai their bill todai and save for tomorrow __PUNCT__
it about small busi open their door __PUNCT__ hire employe and grow __PUNCT__
it about give worker the educ and train to find a good job and prosper in it __PUNCT__
it about the aspir of the american peopl to build a better life for their famili __PUNCT__ dream that begin with a job __PUNCT__
so how ar we go to creat good job __PUNCT__ let start with small busi __PUNCT__ which creat the major of all job __PUNCT__
a recent report sai small busi have creat __NUM__ job so far thi year while other sector ar lose job __PUNCT__
small busi ar the job engin of america __PUNCT__ and i will make it easier for them to grow and creat more job __PUNCT__
there ar two million latino own busi in america __PUNCT__ mani of them start by latina __PUNCT__
the first consider we should have when debat tax polici is how we can help those compani grow and increas the prosper of the million of american famili whose econom secur depend on their success __PUNCT__
it is a terribl mistak to rais tax dure an econom downturn __PUNCT__
increas the tax burden on american imped job growth __PUNCT__ discourag innov and make us less competit __PUNCT__
the mani small busi owner who pai individu tax rate would take strong except to the idea that keep them low help no on but the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
take more monei from small busi depriv them of the capit thei need to invest and grow and hire __PUNCT__
job ar the most import thing our economi creat __PUNCT__
when you rais tax in a bad economi you elimin job __PUNCT__
i not go to let that happen __PUNCT__ i will keep tax low and cut them where i can __PUNCT__
for those of you with children __PUNCT__ i will doubl the child deduct from __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ for everi depend __PUNCT__ in everi famili in america __PUNCT__
i will reduc the estat tax to fifteen percent __PUNCT__ so parent who have spent long year work hard to build a busi __PUNCT__ and provid a decent live to t heir employe __PUNCT__ can leav the product of a lifetim of labor and love to their children __PUNCT__
la raza run on of the largest hous counsel program in the countri that ha help ten of thousand of latino becom homeown with secur mortgag __PUNCT__
but million of american have been hurt by the mortgag crisi and fall home valu __PUNCT__ and mani in the hispan commun have been especi hard hit __PUNCT__
i want to help peopl who genuin need assist in these tough time __PUNCT__ not specul and lender who contribut to thi mess and didn't follow the basic of good busi practic __PUNCT__
i am commit to make sure famili who want to hold onto their home have a chanc to do so __PUNCT__
my home plan allow famili who need help to appli __PUNCT__ either at their local post offic or onlin __PUNCT__ for a new __PUNCT__ guarante __PUNCT__ fix __PUNCT__ rate __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year mortgag that will allow them to remain in their home __PUNCT__ and rais their famili with digniti __PUNCT__
to get our economi on track again __PUNCT__ and creat new and better job __PUNCT__ we need to compet more __PUNCT__ not less __PUNCT__ in the global economi __PUNCT__
we can't build wall to foreign competit __PUNCT__ and we shouldn't want to __PUNCT__
america is the biggest export __PUNCT__ import __PUNCT__ produc __PUNCT__ manufactur __PUNCT__ and innov in the world __PUNCT__
that why i reject the fals virtu of econom isolation __PUNCT__
ani confid __PUNCT__ compet countri and it govern should embrac competit __PUNCT__ it make us stronger __PUNCT__ not hide from our competitor and cheat our consum and worker __PUNCT__
we can compet and win __PUNCT__ as we alwai have __PUNCT__ or we can be left behind __PUNCT__
lower barrier to trade creat more and better job __PUNCT__ and higher wage __PUNCT__
it keep inflat under control __PUNCT__
it make good more afford for low __PUNCT__ and middl __PUNCT__ incom consum __PUNCT__
nineti __PUNCT__ five percent of the world consum live outsid the u. __PUNCT__
our futur prosper depend on open more of these market __PUNCT__ not close them __PUNCT__
i recent travel to colombia and mexico becaus i understand how vital import it is to the prosper and secur of our countri to strengthen our trade __PUNCT__ invest and diplomat ti to other countri in our hemispher __PUNCT__
i have often travel over the year to central and south america __PUNCT__ and i have learn our relationship there ar as import __PUNCT__ if not more import __PUNCT__ as ani relationship we have in the world __PUNCT__
it is the reason why i an unapologet support of nafta __PUNCT__ the central american free trade agreement __PUNCT__ and the colombian free trade agreement __PUNCT__ and why i believ a hemispher free trade agreement is a worthi and necessari goal whose time ha come __PUNCT__
and while it is sure not my intent to becom my oppon schedul __PUNCT__ i hope senat obama soon visit some of the other countri of the america for the first time __PUNCT__
were he to do so __PUNCT__ i think he __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ would see that stronger econom bond with our neighbo rs and the closer friendship thei encourag __PUNCT__ ar a great benefit in mani wai to our countri __PUNCT__
colombian presid urib __PUNCT__ a man of courag and vision __PUNCT__ ha risk much to combat the narco __PUNCT__ terrorist of farc for the sake of all peopl in thi hemispher __PUNCT__
hi recent leadership in free american held hostag for year should earn him the respect and gratitud of all american __PUNCT__
and we should emul hi statesmanship by pass the trade agreement colombia and the unit state have negoti __PUNCT__ and which both countri would greatli benefit from __PUNCT__
i know that not all american have prosper in the global economi __PUNCT__
and for those who __PUNCT__ through no fault of their own __PUNCT__ have lost their job to foreign competit __PUNCT__ i have propos a comprehens reform of our unemploy insur and worker retrain program __PUNCT__
we will us our commun colleg to help train worker for specif opportun in their commun __PUNCT__
and for worker of a certain ag who have lost a job that won't come back __PUNCT__ if thei move rapidli to a new job we help make up the differ in wage between their old job and the new on __PUNCT__
in the global economi what you learn is what you earn __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ studi show that half of hispan enter high school do not graduat with their class __PUNCT__
by the __NUM__ grade __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ student in math and scienc score near the bottom of all industri nation __PUNCT__

that is unaccept in a countri as great as our __PUNCT__
in mani school __PUNCT__ particularli where peopl ar struggl the hardest __PUNCT__ the situat is dire __PUNCT__ and i believ pose the civil right challeng of our time __PUNCT__
we need to shake up fail school bureaucraci with competit __PUNCT__ hold school account for result __PUNCT__ strengthen math __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ technolog and engin curriculum __PUNCT__ empow parent with choic __PUNCT__ remov barrier to qualifi instructor __PUNCT__ attract and reward superior teacher __PUNCT__ and have a fair but sure process to weed out incompet __PUNCT__

mani american did not believ us when we said we would secur our border __PUNCT__ and so we fail in our effort __PUNCT__
i don't want to fail again to achiev comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__
we must prove we have the resourc to secur our border and us them __PUNCT__ while respect the digniti and right of citizen and legal resid of the unit state __PUNCT__
when we have achiev our border secur goal __PUNCT__ we must enact and implement the other part of practic __PUNCT__ fair and necessari immigr polici __PUNCT__
we have econom and humanitarian respons as well __PUNCT__ and thei requir no less dedic from us in meet them __PUNCT__

we can't leav our border undefend __PUNCT__
but these peopl ar god children __PUNCT__ who want simpli to be american __PUNCT__ and we cannot forget the human god command of us as we seek a remedi to thi problem __PUNCT__
i spoke recent at both the naleo and lulac confer __PUNCT__ as did senat obama __PUNCT__
i did not us those occas to critic senat obama __PUNCT__
i would prefer not to do so todai __PUNCT__
but he suggest in hi speech there and here __PUNCT__ that i turn my back on comprehens reform out of polit necess __PUNCT__

at a moment of great difficulti in my campaign __PUNCT__ when my critic said it would be polit suicid for me to do so __PUNCT__ i help author with senat kennedi comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__ and fought for it passag __PUNCT__
i cast a lot of hard vote __PUNCT__ as did the other republican and democrat who join our bipartisan effort __PUNCT__

my campaign wa written off as a lost caus __PUNCT__
i did so not just becaus i believ it wa the right thing to do for hispan american __PUNCT__

senat obama declin t o cast some of those tough vote __PUNCT__

i denounc those insult then __PUNCT__ and i denounc them todai __PUNCT__

when you take the solemn stroll along that wall of black granit on the nation mall __PUNCT__ it is hard not to notic the mani name such as rodriguez __PUNCT__ hernandez __PUNCT__ and lopez that so sadli adorn it __PUNCT__
