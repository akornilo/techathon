it great to be back in ohio __PUNCT__
we need to win ohio on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and with your help we go to win here __PUNCT__ and bring real chang to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
it been a long campaign and we heard a lot of word __PUNCT__ and great campaign trail eloqu __PUNCT__
the amaz thing is that we learn more about senat obama real goal for our countri over the last two week than we learn over the past two year __PUNCT__
it is amaz that even at thi late hour __PUNCT__ we ar still learn more about senat obama and hi agenda __PUNCT__
he told joe the plumber right here in ohio he want to quot __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
it alwai more interest to hear what peopl have to sai in these unscript moment __PUNCT__ and todai we heard anoth moment like thi from senat obama __PUNCT__
in a radio interview reveal todai __PUNCT__ he said that on of the quot __PUNCT__ tragedi __PUNCT__ of the civil right movement is that it didn't bring about a redistribut of wealth in our societi __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ on of the tragedi of the civil right movement wa becaus the civil right movement becam so court __PUNCT__ focus i think that there wa a tendenc to lose track of the polit and commun organ and activ on the ground that ar abl to put togeth the actual coalit of power through which you bring about redistribut chang __PUNCT__
that is what chang mean for barack the redistributor __PUNCT__ it mean take your monei and give it to someon els __PUNCT__
he believ in redistribut wealth __PUNCT__ not in polici that grow our economi and creat job __PUNCT__
he is more interest in control wealth than in creat it __PUNCT__ in redistribut monei instead of spread opportun __PUNCT__
i am go to creat wealth for all american __PUNCT__ by creat opportun for all american __PUNCT__
we all heard hi campaign trail promis __PUNCT__ he sai he onli want to tax the rich __PUNCT__
but these unscript moment and hi record tell a differ stori __PUNCT__
he support the democrat budget plan pass just thi year that call for rais tax on peopl make just __NUM__ dollar per year __PUNCT__
and senat obama ha vote __NUM__ time for tax increas or against tax cut __PUNCT__
senat obama mai sai he try to soak the rich __PUNCT__ but it the middl class who ar go to get put through the wringer __PUNCT__ becaus even the tax increas he admit to miss the target __PUNCT__
to pai for nearli a trillion dollar in new govern spend __PUNCT__ hi tax increas would impact __NUM__ percent of small busi incom in thi countri __PUNCT__ and the job of __NUM__ million middl class american who work for those small busi __PUNCT__
whether it joe the plumber here in ohio or the work men and women across thi countri __PUNCT__ we shouldn't be tax our small busi more as senat obama want to do __PUNCT__ we need to be help them expand their busi and creat job __PUNCT__
america didn't becom the greatest nation on earth by give our monei to the govern to __PUNCT__ redistribut __PUNCT__
in thi countri __PUNCT__ we believ in spread opportun __PUNCT__ for those who need job and those who creat them __PUNCT__
and that is exactli what i intend to do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
my oppon massiv new tax increas is exactli the wrong approach in an econom slowdown __PUNCT__
the answer to a slow economi is not higher tax __PUNCT__ but that is exactli what is go to happen when the democrat have total control of washington __PUNCT__
we can't let that happen __PUNCT__
we need pro __PUNCT__ growth and pro __PUNCT__ job econom polici __PUNCT__ not pro __PUNCT__ govern spend program paid for with higher tax __PUNCT__
thi is the fundament differ between senat obama and me __PUNCT__
we both disagre with presid bush on econom polici __PUNCT__
the differ is that he think tax have been too low __PUNCT__ and i think that spend ha been too high __PUNCT__
senat obama prioriti is not to get spend under control __PUNCT__ it is to spend more __PUNCT__ and if he ha to tax you to do it __PUNCT__ he shown in the past that he doesn't have a problem with that __PUNCT__
we cannot spend the next four year as we have spent much of the last eight __PUNCT__ spend ourselv into a ditch and hope that the consequ don't come __PUNCT__
we need to get our govern under control __PUNCT__ and we need to get our economi move again __PUNCT__
we have to act __PUNCT__
we need a new direct __PUNCT__ and we have to fight for it __PUNCT__
i been fight for thi countri sinc i wa seventeen year old __PUNCT__ and i have the scar to prove it __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i will fight to shake up washington and take america in a new direct from my first dai in offic until my last __PUNCT__
i not afraid of the fight __PUNCT__ i readi for it __PUNCT__
i not go to spend __MONEY__ billion dollar of your monei just bail out the wall street banker and broker who got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
i go to make sure we take care of the work peopl who were devast by the excess of wall street and washington __PUNCT__
i have a plan to hold the line on tax and cut them to make america more competit and creat job here at home __PUNCT__
we go to doubl the child deduct for work famili __PUNCT__
we will cut the capit gain tax __PUNCT__
and we will cut busi tax to help creat job __PUNCT__ and keep american busi in america __PUNCT__
rais tax make a bad economi much wors __PUNCT__
keep tax low creat job __PUNCT__ keep monei in your hand and strengthen our economi __PUNCT__
if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i won't spend nearli a trillion dollar more of your monei __PUNCT__
senat obama will __PUNCT__
and he can't do that without rais your tax or dig us further into debt __PUNCT__
i go to make govern live on a budget just like you do __PUNCT__

what america need now is someon who will finish the race befor the start the victori lap __PUNCT__ someon who will fight to the end __PUNCT__ and not for himself but for hi countri __PUNCT__
