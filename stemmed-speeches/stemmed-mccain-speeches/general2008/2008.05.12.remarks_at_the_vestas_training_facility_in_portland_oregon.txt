thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
i appreci the hospit of vesta wind technolog __PUNCT__
todai is a kind of test run for the compani __PUNCT__
thei got wind technician here __PUNCT__ wind studi __PUNCT__ and all these wind turbin __PUNCT__ but there no wind __PUNCT__
so now i know why thei ask me to come give a speech __PUNCT__
everi dai __PUNCT__ when there ar no report and camera around to draw attent to it __PUNCT__ thi compani and other like it ar do import work __PUNCT__
and what we see here is just a glimps of much bigger thing to come __PUNCT__
wind power is on of mani altern energi sourc that ar chang our economi for the better __PUNCT__
and on dai thei will chang our economi forev __PUNCT__
wind is a clean and predict sourc of energi __PUNCT__ and about as renew as anyth on earth __PUNCT__
along with solar power __PUNCT__ fuel __PUNCT__ cell technolog __PUNCT__ cleaner burn fuel and other new energi sourc __PUNCT__ wind power will bring america closer to energi independ __PUNCT__
our economi depend upon clean and afford altern to fossil fuel __PUNCT__ and so __PUNCT__ in mani wai __PUNCT__ doe our secur __PUNCT__
a larg share of the world oil reserv is control by foreign power that do not have our interest at heart __PUNCT__
and as our relianc on oil pass awai __PUNCT__ their power will vanish with it __PUNCT__
in the come week __PUNCT__ i intend to address mani of the great challeng that america energi polici must meet __PUNCT__
when we debat energi bill in washington __PUNCT__ it should be more than a competit among industri for special favor __PUNCT__ subsidi __PUNCT__ and tax break __PUNCT__
in the congress __PUNCT__ we need to send the special interest on their wai __PUNCT__ without their favor and subsidi __PUNCT__
we need to draw on the best idea of both parti __PUNCT__ and on all the resourc a free market can provid __PUNCT__
we need to keep our ey on big goal in energi polici __PUNCT__ the seriou danger __PUNCT__ and the common interest of the american peopl __PUNCT__
todai i like to focu on just on of those challeng __PUNCT__ and among environment danger it is sure the most seriou of all __PUNCT__
whether we call it __PUNCT__ climat chang __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ global warm __PUNCT__ in the end we all left with the same set of fact __PUNCT__
the fact of global warm demand our urgent attent __PUNCT__ especi in washington __PUNCT__
good stewardship __PUNCT__ prudenc __PUNCT__ and simpl commonsens demand that we to act meet the challeng __PUNCT__ and act quickli __PUNCT__
some of the most compel evid of global warm come to us from nasa __PUNCT__
no longer do we need to reli on guesswork and comput model __PUNCT__ becaus satellit imag reveal a dramat disappear of glacier __PUNCT__ antarct ic shelv and polar ic sheet __PUNCT__
and i seen some of thi evid up close __PUNCT__
a few year ago i travel to the area of svalbard __PUNCT__ norwai __PUNCT__ a group of island in the arctic ocean __PUNCT__
i wa shown the southernmost point where a glacier had reach twenti year earlier __PUNCT__
from there __PUNCT__ we had to ventur northward up the fjord to see where that same glacier end todai __PUNCT__ becaus all the rest ha melt __PUNCT__
on a trip to alaska __PUNCT__ i heard about a nation park visitor center that wa built to offer a pictur __PUNCT__ perfect view of a larg glacier __PUNCT__
problem is __PUNCT__ the glacier is gone __PUNCT__
a work of natur that took ag to form had melt awai in a matter of decad __PUNCT__
our scientist have also seen and measur reduc snowpack __PUNCT__ with earlier runoff in the pacif northwest and elsewher __PUNCT__
we have seen sustain drought in the southwest __PUNCT__ and across the world averag temperatur that seem to reach new record everi few year __PUNCT__
we have seen a higher incid of extrem weather event __PUNCT__
in the frozen wild of alaska __PUNCT__ the arctic __PUNCT__ antarct __PUNCT__ and elsewher __PUNCT__ wildlif biologist have note sudden chang in anim migrat pattern __PUNCT__ a loss of their habitat __PUNCT__ a rise in sea level __PUNCT__
and you would think that if the polar bear __PUNCT__ walrus __PUNCT__ and sea bird have the good sens to respond to new condit and new danger __PUNCT__ then human can respond as well __PUNCT__
we have mani advantag in the fight against global warm __PUNCT__ but time is not on of them __PUNCT__
instead of idli debat the precis extent of global warm __PUNCT__ or the precis timelin of global warm __PUNCT__ we need to deal with the central fact of rise temperatur __PUNCT__ rise water __PUNCT__ and all the endless troubl that global warm will bring __PUNCT__
we stand warn by seriou and credibl scientist across the world that time is short and the danger ar great __PUNCT__
the most relev question now is whether our own govern is equal to the challeng __PUNCT__
there ar vital measur we can take in the short term __PUNCT__ even as we focu on long __PUNCT__ term polici to mitig the effect of global warm __PUNCT__
in the year ahead __PUNCT__ we ar like to see reduc water suppli __PUNCT__ more forest fire than in previou decad __PUNCT__ chang in crop product __PUNCT__ more heat wave afflict our citi and a greater intens in storm __PUNCT__
each on of these consequ of climat chang will requir polici to protect our citizen __PUNCT__ especi those most vulner to violent weather __PUNCT__
each on will requir new precaut in the repair and construct of our road __PUNCT__ bridg __PUNCT__ railwai __PUNCT__ seawal and other infrastructur __PUNCT__
some state and local govern have alreadi begun their plan and prepar for extrem event and other impact of climat chang __PUNCT__
the feder govern can help them in mani wai __PUNCT__ abov all by coordin their effort __PUNCT__ and i am commit to provid that support __PUNCT__
to lead in thi effort __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ our govern must strike at the sourc of the problem __PUNCT__ with reform that onli congress can enact and the presid can sign __PUNCT__
we know that greenhous gass ar heavili implic as a caus of climat chang __PUNCT__
and we know that among all greenhous gass __PUNCT__ the worst by far is the carbon __PUNCT__ dioxid that result from fossil __PUNCT__ fuel combust __PUNCT__
yet for all the good work of entrepreneur and inventor in find cleaner and better technolog __PUNCT__ the fundament incent of the market ar still on the side of carbon __PUNCT__ base energi __PUNCT__
thi ha to chang befor we can make the decis shift awai from fossil fuel __PUNCT__
for the market to do more __PUNCT__ govern must do more by open new path of invent and ingenu __PUNCT__
and we must do thi in a wai that give american busi new incent and new reward to seek __PUNCT__ instead of just give them new tax to pai and new order to follow __PUNCT__
the most direct wai to achiev thi is through a system that set clear limit on all greenhous gase __PUNCT__ while also allow the sale of right to excess emiss __PUNCT__
and thi is the propos i will submit to the congress if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system to chang the dynam of our energi economi __PUNCT__
as a program under the clean air act __PUNCT__ the cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system achiev enorm success in rid the air of acid rain __PUNCT__
and the same approach that brought a declin in sulfur dioxid emiss can have an equal dramat and perman effect on carbon emiss __PUNCT__
instantli __PUNCT__ automak __PUNCT__ coal compani __PUNCT__ power plant __PUNCT__ and everi other enterpris in america would have an incent to reduc carbon emiss __PUNCT__ becaus when thei go under those limit thei can sell the balanc of permit emiss for cash __PUNCT__
as never befor __PUNCT__ the market would reward ani person or compani that seek to invent __PUNCT__ improv __PUNCT__ or acquir altern to carbon __PUNCT__ base energi __PUNCT__
it is veri hard to pictur ventur capitalist __PUNCT__ corpor planner __PUNCT__ small busi and environmentalist all work to the same good purpos __PUNCT__
but such cooper is actual possibl in the case of climat chang __PUNCT__ and thi reform will set it in motion __PUNCT__
the peopl of thi countri have a geniu for adapt __PUNCT__ solv problem __PUNCT__ and invent new and better wai to accomplish our goal __PUNCT__
but the feder govern can't just summon those talent by command __PUNCT__ onli the free market can draw them out __PUNCT__
a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade polici will send a signal that will be heard and welcom all across the american economi __PUNCT__
those who want clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ more wind and solar __PUNCT__ nuclear power __PUNCT__ biomass and bio __PUNCT__ fuel will have their opportun through a new market that reward those and other innov in clean energi __PUNCT__
the market will evolv __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ by requir sensibl reduct in greenhous gase __PUNCT__ but also by allow full flexibl in how industri meet that requir __PUNCT__
entrepreneur and firm will know which energi invest thei should make __PUNCT__
and the highest reward will go to those who make the smartest __PUNCT__ safest __PUNCT__ most respons choic __PUNCT__
a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade reform wi ll also creat a profit opportun for rural america to receiv market __PUNCT__ base payment __PUNCT__ instead of govern subsidi __PUNCT__ for the conserv practic that store carbon in the soil of our nation farm __PUNCT__
we will cap emiss accord to specif goal __PUNCT__ measur progress by refer to past carbon emiss __PUNCT__
by the year __NUM__ we will seek a return to __NUM__ level of emiss __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ a return to __NUM__ level __PUNCT__ and so on until we have achiev at least a reduct of sixti percent below __NUM__ level by the year __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in the cours of time __PUNCT__ it mai be that new idea and technolog will come along that we can hardli imagin todai __PUNCT__ allow all industri to chang with a speed that will surpris us __PUNCT__
more like __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ there will be some compani that need extra emiss right __PUNCT__ and thei will be abl to bui them __PUNCT__
the system to meet these target and timet will give these compani extra time to adapt __PUNCT__ and that is good econom polici __PUNCT__
it is also a matter of simpl fair __PUNCT__ becaus the cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system will creat job __PUNCT__ improv livelihood __PUNCT__ and strengthen futur across our countri __PUNCT__
the goal in all of thi is to assur an energi suppli that is safe __PUNCT__ secur __PUNCT__ divers __PUNCT__ and domest __PUNCT__
and in pursuit of these object __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to take econom growth and job creation for grant __PUNCT__
a strong and grow economi is essenti to all of our goal __PUNCT__ and especi the goal of find altern to carbon __PUNCT__ base technolog __PUNCT__
we want to turn the american economi toward cleaner and safer energi sourc __PUNCT__
and you can't achiev that by impos cost that the american economi cannot sustain __PUNCT__
as part of my cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade incent __PUNCT__ i will also propos to includ the purchas of offset from those outsid the scope of the trade system __PUNCT__
thi will broaden the arrai of reward for reduc emiss __PUNCT__ while also lower the cost of complianc with our new emiss standard __PUNCT__
through the sale of offset __PUNCT__ and with strict standard to assur that reduct ar real __PUNCT__ our agricultur sector alon can provid as much as forti percent of the overal reduct we will requir in greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__
and in the short term __PUNCT__ farmer and rancher can do it in some of the most cost __PUNCT__ effect wai __PUNCT__
over time __PUNCT__ an increas fraction of permit for emiss could be suppli by auction __PUNCT__ yield feder revenu that can be put to good us __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ we will appli these and other feder fund to help build the infrastructur of a post __PUNCT__ carbon economi __PUNCT__
we will support project to advanc technolog that captur and store carbon emiss __PUNCT__
we will assist in transmit wind __PUNCT__ and solar __PUNCT__ gener power from state that have them to state that need them __PUNCT__
we will add to current feder effort to develop promis technolog __PUNCT__ such as plug __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hybrid __PUNCT__ flex __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl __PUNCT__ and hydrogen __PUNCT__ power car and truck __PUNCT__
we will also establish clear standard in govern __PUNCT__ fund research __PUNCT__ to make sure that fund is effect and focus on the right goal __PUNCT__
and to creat greater demand for the best technolog and practic in energi conserv __PUNCT__ we will us the purchas power of the unit state govern __PUNCT__
our govern can hardli expect citizen and privat busi to adopt or invest in low __PUNCT__ carbon technolog when it doesn't alwai hold itself to the same standard __PUNCT__
we need to set a better exampl in washington __PUNCT__ by consist appli the best environment standard to everi purchas our govern make __PUNCT__
as we move toward all of these goal __PUNCT__ and over time put the ag of fossil fuel behind us __PUNCT__ we must consid everi altern sourc of power __PUNCT__ and that includ nuclear power __PUNCT__
when our cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade polici is in place __PUNCT__ there will be a sudden and sustain pursuit in the market for new invest opportun in low __PUNCT__ emiss fuel sourc __PUNCT__
and here we have a known __PUNCT__ proven energi sourc that requir exactli zero emiss __PUNCT__
we have __NUM__ nuclear reactor in our countri __PUNCT__ gener about twenti percent of our electr __PUNCT__
these reactor alon spare the atmospher from about __NUM__ million metric ton of carbon dioxid that would otherwis be releas everi year __PUNCT__
that the annual equival of nearli all emiss from all the car we drive in america __PUNCT__
europ __PUNCT__ for it part __PUNCT__ ha __NUM__ reactor in oper __PUNCT__ and nation includ franc and belgium deriv more than half their electr from nuclear power __PUNCT__
those good practic contribut to the more than two billion metric ton of carbon dioxid avoid everi year __PUNCT__ worldwid __PUNCT__ becaus of nuclear energi __PUNCT__
it doesn't take a leap in logic to conclud that if we want to arrest global warm __PUNCT__ then nuclear energi is a power alli in that caus __PUNCT__
in a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade energi economi __PUNCT__ the cost of build new reactor will be less prohibit __PUNCT__
the incent to invest in a matur __PUNCT__ zero __PUNCT__ emiss technolog will be stronger __PUNCT__
new research and innov will help the industri to overcom the well known drawback to nuclear power __PUNCT__ such as the transport and storag of wast __PUNCT__
and our govern can help in these effort __PUNCT__
we can support research to extend the us of exist plant __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ we must make certain that everi plant in america is safe from the design of terrorist __PUNCT__
and when all of thi is assur __PUNCT__ it will be time again to expand our us of on of the cleanest __PUNCT__ safest __PUNCT__ and most reliabl sourc of energi on earth __PUNCT__
for all of the last centuri __PUNCT__ the profit motiv basic led in on direct __PUNCT__ toward machin __PUNCT__ method __PUNCT__ and industri that us oil and ga __PUNCT__
enorm good came from that industri growth __PUNCT__ and we ar all the beneficiari of the nation prosper it built __PUNCT__
but there were cost we weren't count __PUNCT__ and often hardli notic __PUNCT__
and these terribl cost have ad up now __PUNCT__ in the atmospher __PUNCT__ in the ocean __PUNCT__ and all across the natur world __PUNCT__
thei ar no longer tenabl __PUNCT__ sustain __PUNCT__ or defens __PUNCT__
and what better wai to correct past error than to turn the creativ energi of the free market in the other direct __PUNCT__ under the cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system __PUNCT__ thi can happen __PUNCT__
in all it power __PUNCT__ the profit motiv will suddenli begin to shift and point the other wai toward cleaner fuel __PUNCT__ wiser wai __PUNCT__ and a healthier planet __PUNCT__
as a nation __PUNCT__ we make our own environment plan and our own resolut __PUNCT__
but work with other nation to arrest climat chang can be an even tougher proposit __PUNCT__
on of the greatest difficulti is to gain the cooper of china __PUNCT__
that nation todai is deal with a catastroph earthquak and the loss of thousand of citizen __PUNCT__ includ mani children and student __PUNCT__
the unit state govern ha offer to help in ani wai possibl __PUNCT__ and all of us hope that rescuer will be abl to save more live at a terribl time for the peopl of the sichuan provinc __PUNCT__
in address the problem of climat chang __PUNCT__ cooper from the govern of china will be essenti __PUNCT__
china __PUNCT__ india __PUNCT__ and other develop econom power in particular ar among the greatest contributor to global warm todai __PUNCT__ increas carbon emiss at a furiou pace __PUNCT__ and thei ar not recept to intern standard __PUNCT__
nor do thei think that we in the industri world ar in ani posit to preach the good new of carbon __PUNCT__ emiss control __PUNCT__
we made most of our contribut to global warm befor anyon knew about global warm __PUNCT__
thi set of fact and perceiv self __PUNCT__ interest prove the undo of the kyoto protocol __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will have to deal with the same set of fact __PUNCT__
i will not shirk the mantl of leadership that the unit state bear __PUNCT__
i will not permit eight long year to pass without seriou action on seriou challeng __PUNCT__
i will not accept the same dead __PUNCT__ end of fail diplomaci that claim kyoto __PUNCT__
the unit state will lead and will lead with a differ approach __PUNCT__ an approach that speak to the interest and oblig of everi nation __PUNCT__
share danger mean share duti __PUNCT__ and global problem requir global cooper __PUNCT__
the unit state and our friend in europ cannot alon deal with the threat of global warm __PUNCT__
no nation should be exempt from it oblig __PUNCT__
and least of all should we make except for the veri countri that ar acceler carbon emiss while the rest of us seek to reduc emiss __PUNCT__
if we ar go to establish meaning environment protocol __PUNCT__ then thei must includ the two nation that have the potenti to pollut the air faster __PUNCT__ and in greater annual volum __PUNCT__ than ani nation ever in histori __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we will continu in good faith to negoti with china and other nation to enact the standard and control that ar in the interest of everi nation __PUNCT__ whatev their stage of econom develop __PUNCT__
and america can take the lead in offer these develop nation the low __PUNCT__ carbon technolog that we will make and thei will need __PUNCT__
on good idea or invent to reduc carbon emiss is worth a thousand fine craft propos at a confer tabl __PUNCT__
and the govern of these develop econom power will soon recogn __PUNCT__ as america is begin to do __PUNCT__ their urgent need for cleaner __PUNCT__ burn fuel and safer sourc of energi __PUNCT__
if the effort to negoti an intern solut that includ china and india do not succe __PUNCT__ we still have an oblig to act __PUNCT__
in my approach to global climat __PUNCT__ control effort __PUNCT__ we will appli the principl of equal treatment __PUNCT__
we will appli the same environment standard to industri in china __PUNCT__ india __PUNCT__ and elsewher that we appli to our own industri __PUNCT__
and if industri countri seek an econom advantag by evad those standard __PUNCT__ i would work with the european union and other like __PUNCT__ mind govern that plan to address the global warm problem to develop effect diplomaci __PUNCT__ effect a transfer of technolog __PUNCT__ or other mean to engag those countri that declin to enact a similar cap __PUNCT__
for all of it histor disregard of environment standard __PUNCT__ it cannot have escap the attent of the chines regim that china ski ar danger pollut __PUNCT__ it beauti river ar dy __PUNCT__ it grassland vanish __PUNCT__ it coastlin reced __PUNCT__ and it own glacier melt __PUNCT__
we know mani of these sign from our own experi __PUNCT__ from environment lesson learn the hard wai __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ all the world know that thei ar the sign of even greater troubl to come __PUNCT__
press on blindli with uncontrol carbon emiss is in no on interest __PUNCT__ especi china __PUNCT__
and the rest of the world stand readi to help __PUNCT__
like other environment challeng __PUNCT__ onli more so __PUNCT__ global warm present a test of foresight __PUNCT__ of polit courag __PUNCT__ and of the unselfish concern that on gener ow to the next __PUNCT__
we need to think straight about the danger ahead __PUNCT__ and to meet the problem with all the resourc of human ingenu at our dispos __PUNCT__
we american like to sai that there is no problem we can't solv __PUNCT__ howev complic __PUNCT__ and no obstacl we cannot overcom if we meet it togeth __PUNCT__
i believ thi about our countri __PUNCT__
i know thi about our countri __PUNCT__
and now it is time for us to show those qualiti onc again __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
