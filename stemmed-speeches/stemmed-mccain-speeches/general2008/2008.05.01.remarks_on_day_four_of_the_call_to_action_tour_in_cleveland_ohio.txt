yesterdai __PUNCT__ i wit the power of cut edg technolog __PUNCT__ ii hospit that is leav paper behind __PUNCT__ embrac inform technolog and connect to improv care and expand access __PUNCT__
thi campaign will includ a seriou discuss of health care in our nation becaus despit the shine exampl of the high achiev of american medic scienc our health care system fall short of provid qualiti care at low cost to all american __PUNCT__
underli the mani thing that troubl our health care system ar the fundament problem of cost and access __PUNCT__
rise cost hurt those who have insur by make it more expens to keep __PUNCT__
thei hurt those who don't have insur by make it even harder to obtain __PUNCT__
rise health care cost hurt employ and the self __PUNCT__ emploi alik __PUNCT__
and in the end thei threaten seriou and last harm to the entir american economi __PUNCT__
these rise cost ar by no mean alwai accompani by better qualiti in care or coverag __PUNCT__
in mani respect the system ha remain less reliabl __PUNCT__ less effici __PUNCT__ more disorgan and prone to error even as it becom more expens __PUNCT__
there ar those who ar convinc that the solut is to move closer to a nation health care system __PUNCT__
thei urg univers coverag __PUNCT__ with all the tax increas __PUNCT__ new mandat __PUNCT__ and govern regul that come along with that idea __PUNCT__
but in the end thi will accomplish on thing onli __PUNCT__
we will replac the ineffici __PUNCT__ irration __PUNCT__ and uncontrol cost of the current system with the ineffici __PUNCT__ irration __PUNCT__ and uncontrol cost of a govern monopoli __PUNCT__
we have all the problem __PUNCT__ and more __PUNCT__ of privat health care __PUNCT__ rigid rule __PUNCT__ long wait and lack of choic __PUNCT__ and risk degrad it great strength and advantag includ the innov and life __PUNCT__ save technolog that make american medicin the most advanc in the world __PUNCT__
i have a differ vision __PUNCT__
the kei to real reform is to restor control over our health __PUNCT__ care system to the patient themselv __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ even those with access to health care often have no assur that it is appropri care __PUNCT__
too much of the system is built on get paid just for provid servic __PUNCT__ regardless of whether those servic ar necessari or produc qualiti care and outcom __PUNCT__
american famili should onli pai for get the right care __PUNCT__ care that is intend to improv and safeguard their health __PUNCT__
when famili ar inform about medic choic __PUNCT__ thei ar more capabl of make their own decis __PUNCT__ less like to choos the most expens and often unnecessari option __PUNCT__ and ar more satisfi with their choic __PUNCT__
but for everi american who want it __PUNCT__ anoth option would be avail __PUNCT__ everi year __PUNCT__ thei would receiv a __MONEY__ tax credit directli __PUNCT__ with the same cash valu of the credit for employe in big compani __PUNCT__ in a small busi __PUNCT__ or self __PUNCT__ emploi __PUNCT__
you simpli choos the insur provid that suit you best __PUNCT__
by mail or onlin __PUNCT__ you would then inform the govern of your select __PUNCT__
and the monei to help pai for your health care would be sent straight to that insur provid __PUNCT__
the health plan you chose would be as good as ani that an employ could choos for you __PUNCT__
it would be your and your famili health __PUNCT__ care plan __PUNCT__ and your to keep __PUNCT__
i have also pledg to meet with the governor to solicit their idea about the best wai to provid insur to those deni coverag under current practic __PUNCT__
i will build a guarante access plan or gap that would reflect the best experi of the state __PUNCT__
i will work with congress __PUNCT__ the governor __PUNCT__ and industri to make sure that it is fund adequ and ha the right incent to reduc cost such as diseas manag __PUNCT__ individu case manag __PUNCT__ and health and well program __PUNCT__
my reform will chang the practic of medicin in america __PUNCT__
we know from experi that coordin care __PUNCT__ provid collabor to produc the best health outcom __PUNCT__ offer better qualiti and can cost less __PUNCT__
we should pai a singl bill for high __PUNCT__ qualiti diseas care __PUNCT__ not an endless seri of bill for pre __PUNCT__ surgic test and visit __PUNCT__ hospit and surgeri __PUNCT__ and follow __PUNCT__ up test __PUNCT__ drug and offic visit __PUNCT__
pai for coordin care mean that everi singl provid is now unit on be respons to the need of a singl person __PUNCT__ the patient __PUNCT__
health inform technolog will flourish becaus the market will demand it __PUNCT__
famili also place a high valu on quickli get simpl care __PUNCT__ and have shown a willing to pai cash to get it __PUNCT__
if walk __PUNCT__ in clinic in retail outlet ar the most conveni __PUNCT__ cost __PUNCT__ effect wai for famili to safe meet simpl need __PUNCT__ then no polici of govern should stand in their wai __PUNCT__
and if the cheapest wai to get high qualiti care is to us advanc in web technolog to allow a doctor to practic across state line __PUNCT__ then let them __PUNCT__
chronic condit __PUNCT__ such as cancer __PUNCT__ heart diseas __PUNCT__ high blood pressur __PUNCT__ diabet and asthma __PUNCT__ account for three __PUNCT__ quarter of the nation annual health __PUNCT__ care bill __PUNCT__
we can make tremend improv in the cost of treat chronic diseas by us modern inform technolog to collect inform on the practic pattern __PUNCT__ cost and effect of physician __PUNCT__
by simpli document and dissemin inform on best practic we can elimin those costli practic that don't yield correspond valu __PUNCT__
by reform payment system to focu on payment for best practic and qualiti outcom __PUNCT__ we will acceler thi import chang __PUNCT__
in everi dimens __PUNCT__ innov will be at the heart of provid better care __PUNCT__ at lower cost __PUNCT__ for everi american __PUNCT__
innov is the wellspr that will bring us new treatment __PUNCT__ better inform __PUNCT__ and put famili in charg of their health care __PUNCT__
we will see some of that innov todai __PUNCT__ an electron medic record as a path to increas qualiti __PUNCT__ lower cost and improv safeti __PUNCT__ a patient health record to help deliv better care and put power in the hand of patient __PUNCT__ and a wai to connect patient with physician __PUNCT__ pharmaci __PUNCT__ clinic and hospit __PUNCT__
we need to find wai to organ patient data to make inform access and us __PUNCT__ allow patient to manag their medic record __PUNCT__ and still protect the privaci of health inform __PUNCT__
these innov ar an inspir __PUNCT__ and a remind of all that good in american health care __PUNCT__
we need that remind sometim in washington __PUNCT__
