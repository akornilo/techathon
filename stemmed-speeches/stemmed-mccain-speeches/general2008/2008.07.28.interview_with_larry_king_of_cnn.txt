king __PUNCT__ is it fair that voter should be concern about your health though __PUNCT__ you had four melanoma surgic remov __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ if not an issu __PUNCT__ it certainli a concern isn't it __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
as i sai __PUNCT__ melanoma is someth if you look at it __PUNCT__ and you be care __PUNCT__ it fine __PUNCT__
i had on seriou bout with it and that wa __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ due to my own neglect becaus i let it go and go and go __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i wa run for presid at the time __PUNCT__
i not make that mistak again __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ there a lot of thing go on but that certainli isn't on of them __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ and the rest of your health is ok __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it great __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ veri invigor __PUNCT__ feel great __PUNCT__ have a lot of fun __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as i have told you befor on thi show __PUNCT__ a gui that stood fifth from the bottom of hi class at the naval academi in america __PUNCT__ anyth is possibl __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ senat obama ha taken flack for a recent oversea trip __PUNCT__
your campaign call it a prematur victori lap __PUNCT__
he wa ask about such critic yesterdai at a uniti of journalist of color confer in chicago __PUNCT__
here what he said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
barack obama __PUNCT__ i wa puzzl by thi notion that somehow what we were do wa in ani wai differ from what senat mccain or a lot of presidenti candid have done in the past __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i admit __PUNCT__ we did it realli well __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ and that __PUNCT__ but that shouldn't be a strike against me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ you critic him for the trip __PUNCT__ a trip that you told him to make __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ i wa glad that he went to iraq __PUNCT__
i wa puzzl and befuddl by the fact that he announc hi polici toward iraq and afghanistan befor he went __PUNCT__
i had hope that he would go __PUNCT__ and for the first time __PUNCT__ sit down and get a brief from gener petraeu __PUNCT__
you know he never had befor __PUNCT__ i had wish __PUNCT__ in a wai __PUNCT__ that he had a hear in the subcommitte that he chair on afghanistan sinc he ha the respons oversight of nato __PUNCT__
but incred to me __PUNCT__ still __PUNCT__ is that he doe not acknowledg that the surg succeed __PUNCT__
no ration person could go to iraq in the last few dai and compar it to two year ago and not acknowledg that the surg ha succeed __PUNCT__
and that why i question veri much why he would continu to fail to acknowledg that a strategi __PUNCT__ admittedli __PUNCT__ he condemn it __PUNCT__ he said it wouldn't work __PUNCT__ he said that it would make thing wors __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__
but at least he ought to acknowledg __PUNCT__ after get brief by gener petraeu and meet these brave young american who have sacrif so much in make sure that thi strategi succeed __PUNCT__ that he should acknowledg their success __PUNCT__
how do you welcom thi last brigad home that come home and sai __PUNCT__ hei __PUNCT__ great job __PUNCT__ but by the wai __PUNCT__ you didn't succe __PUNCT__ i don't know how you do that __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ but wa he right in sai that a lot more emphasi should have been put on afghanistan __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ thi is __PUNCT__ if we had fail in iraq __PUNCT__ our complic in afghanistan would have been far __PUNCT__ far more complic __PUNCT__
what senat obama doesn't understand is that thei ar all connect __PUNCT__
if we had lost the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we would have had much greater problem in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and also __PUNCT__ the strategi that he said wouldn't work in iraq is the same strategi we have to emploi in afghanistan __PUNCT__
it not just to increas the number of troop __PUNCT__ it secur and hold __PUNCT__ it a govern that function more effect __PUNCT__ it take on the narco __PUNCT__ traffick __PUNCT__ it the issu of pakistan __PUNCT__ which is of cours the border area __PUNCT__ it uncontrol __PUNCT__
so it got to be an overal strategi __PUNCT__
and senat obama doe not understand that __PUNCT__ just like he didn't understand the situat in iraq __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ so you not critic him for the trip __PUNCT__ which you told him to make __PUNCT__ you critic him for what you sai is a lack of awar __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ lack of understand __PUNCT__ complet lack of understand of what america nation secur threat ar __PUNCT__
but the other thing is that __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the fact that in germani he did not go to landstuhl __PUNCT__
and i can assur you that the troop welcom __PUNCT__ especi those who ar the grave wound on __PUNCT__ welcom american senat __PUNCT__
and if he had want to go with just a staffer __PUNCT__ i am confid that he could have gone __PUNCT__ rather than cancel hi trip to see those brave young american __PUNCT__
but it also about bring back prosper __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ he must have understood that __PUNCT__
why do you think he didn't go __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i have no idea except that i know that accord to report that he want to bring media peopl and camera and hi campaign staffer and i want to guarante you __PUNCT__ if i had gone to landstuhl __PUNCT__ which i have and met with the troop there and met with the wound but if i had gone there and the militari had said __PUNCT__ you can't see these wound peopl __PUNCT__
i guarante i have been on the phone with the secretari of defens immedi __PUNCT__
i have seen them __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ we be right back with senat mccain with what everyon want to know __PUNCT__
who might hi run mate go to be __PUNCT__ that ahead __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i said i would rather lose a campaign than see america lose a war __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ we back with senat john mccain __PUNCT__
we have an e __PUNCT__ mail question from scott in chappaqua __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__
we haven't heard that citi mention in a while __PUNCT__ i have notic particularli in the past few dai that you increas your us of neg ad and person statement about senat obama __PUNCT__
whatev happen to your assur you would not engag in such neg __PUNCT__ what about your call for a civil and respect campaign __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i admir and respect senat obama __PUNCT__
he ha done a great job secur the nomin to hi parti __PUNCT__
he also us hi opposit to the war in iraq as a wai to secur that __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ there ar just start differ between us and those differ need to be drawn __PUNCT__ whether it be health care or he want basic govern to run the health care program __PUNCT__
whether it want tax where he want to rais tax wherea i want to keep them low __PUNCT__
to our nation secur requir and includ offshor drill __PUNCT__
he oppos to offshor drill __PUNCT__
he is oppos to nuclear power __PUNCT__
right now the american peopl ar hurt veri badli as you know __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
thei ar sit around the kitchen tabl try to figur out how thei can do all these thing and these ar stark differ and the american peopl in my view need to hear about them __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ so you sai it not neg __PUNCT__ it differ of opinion __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ oh ye __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei ar clearli differ __PUNCT__
senat obama is against store spent nuclear fuel or reprocess it __PUNCT__
i favor it __PUNCT__
he is against offshor drill __PUNCT__
i favor it __PUNCT__
those ar strong differ __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ you oppos offshor __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and american care a great deal __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ you oppos offshor drill __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ when oil wa a buck __PUNCT__
when oil wa __MONEY__ a gallon or __MONEY__ or whatev it is __PUNCT__
now it is right around __MONEY__ and so of cours __PUNCT__
but i also believ state should be make those decis as well but i love to give them some more incent to do so __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ you were ask what the unit state would do if the sovereign govern of iran __PUNCT__ of iran ask you to pull out __PUNCT__ even if the unit state wasn't happi about the secur situat __PUNCT__
do you stand by that __PUNCT__ if iraq said __PUNCT__ pull out __PUNCT__ would you sai ok __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__ but the fact is that even prime minist maliki ha state that it wa condit __PUNCT__ base and more importantli __PUNCT__ or as importantli __PUNCT__ senat obama date for withdraw propos __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ hi origin propos thei would have been out of there last march but the present propos __PUNCT__ our highest rank militari offic __PUNCT__ admir mullen __PUNCT__ said would be veri danger __PUNCT__
gener petraeu said that it would be veri danger for us to pursu that strategi __PUNCT__
i also would listen veri carefulli __PUNCT__ particularli to gener petraeu __PUNCT__ who ha carri thi incred surg which mani polit pundit on your show said that had no chanc and that the war wa lost __PUNCT__
harri reid announc the war wa lost __PUNCT__
gener petraeu should be listen to __PUNCT__
and he shouldn't drive all decis __PUNCT__
but at the same time __PUNCT__ the fact is that the iraqi ar interest in their secur as well and we will negoti with them on a condit __PUNCT__ base basi and we withdraw becaus we succeed and we come home in victori __PUNCT__
senat obama said he might have to go back __PUNCT__
i guarante you __PUNCT__ when thei come home under my plan __PUNCT__ thei won't have to go back __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ in that regard __PUNCT__ you said fridai on cnn that you thought __NUM__ month might be a pretti good timet for the withdraw of u. __PUNCT__ troop from iraq __PUNCT__
and that sound a lot like what senat obama ha been sai __PUNCT__
so what the differ there __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i love these dai of the sound bite __PUNCT__
i said it ha to be base on condit on the ground __PUNCT__
senat obama said it a hard and firm date __PUNCT__
that why the chairman of the joint chief of staff said it had to be condit base and said that hi approach would be veri __PUNCT__ veri danger __PUNCT__
the wai the question wa ask __PUNCT__ why not __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the fact is we have to be condit base and we ar withdraw __PUNCT__
the last brigad from the surg is come home at the end of thi month or earli next month and we will be have further withdraw base on condit __PUNCT__
now whether that fit into __NUM__ month or not __PUNCT__ or on month __PUNCT__ or whatev __PUNCT__ the point is it got to be condit __PUNCT__ base and that the point gener petraeu is try to get over as we go into thi polit season __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ if you were presid and knew that bin laden wa in pakistan __PUNCT__ you know where __PUNCT__ would you have u. __PUNCT__ forc go in after him __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__ i not go to go there and here why __PUNCT__ becaus pakistan is a sovereign nation __PUNCT__
i think the pakistani would want bin laden out of their hair and out of their countri and it caus great difficulti in pakistan itself __PUNCT__
but i want to assur you i will get osama bin laden as presid of the unit state and i will bring him to justic no matter what it take __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ you have said quit a bit late in all of your speech practic that you will never do anyth just for polit __PUNCT__
you will stand on your own philosophi and not go the polit rout __PUNCT__
can't we sai that senat obama did that when he oppos the war in iraq and __NUM__ percent of america favor it __PUNCT__ wasn't he stand on a principl __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ he wa in the illinoi state senat __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
but he still vocal express it __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the fact is we achiev signific victori initi and it wa the fail strategi afterward by rumsfeld that i stood up against and wa call disloy by republican for sai we had to have thi new strategi and we had to win __PUNCT__
i am glad saddam hussein is not in power anymor __PUNCT__
he us weapon of mass destruct twice __PUNCT__ onc on hi own peopl and there no doubt he would be try to acquir and us weapon of mass destruct again __PUNCT__
i think the world is better off with a stabl alli in the middl east in the form of an iraqi govern that is an alli and friend __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ if thi would go back __PUNCT__ start all over again __PUNCT__ would you go into iraq if you could go back __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think the world is better off know what i know at the time and the fact that saddam hussein wa bent on acquir weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion oil for food scandal __PUNCT__
american airplan were be shot at __PUNCT__
sanction were break down __PUNCT__
it clear that he want to go back and acquir weapon of mass destruct and us them __PUNCT__
i don't think there is ani doubt __PUNCT__
i think we did the right thing __PUNCT__
i think that it wa a coloss intellig failur on the part of the unit state and everi other counti as to whether he had them or not __PUNCT__
but again __PUNCT__ i would remind you __PUNCT__ i said we would have an easi victori __PUNCT__
we did __PUNCT__
and then we emploi the wrong strategi which doom us to failur and we were lose thi war when i said we had to have thi new strategi all along and stoop up for it when most polit pundit said that my career wa finish __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ some more moment with the senat __PUNCT__ the vice presidenti question and answer __PUNCT__ mayb __PUNCT__ next __PUNCT__

but a recent poll sai __NUM__ percent of regist voter think you should definit pick a run mate with strong econom credenti __PUNCT__

it will be strictli on when we can arriv at a conclus and obvious it tough becaus we have so mani highli qualifi individu __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ men and women __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ men and women __PUNCT__
and if i start run down the list __PUNCT__ i get in real seriou troubl __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ concern the olymp __PUNCT__ if you were presid __PUNCT__ would you attend the open ceremoni __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i don't think i would particularli in light of the tibetan situat __PUNCT__
i want good relat with china __PUNCT__
i recogn china is an emerg superpow but frankli i don't question the presid decis and it a decis onli a presid can take __PUNCT__
as a privat citizen i think that the televis coverag of it is go to be veri excel __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ well said __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__
the next presid will appar __PUNCT__ accord to all announc __PUNCT__ will inherit a budget deficit of more than __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
and i know we can't answer that in a short time __PUNCT__
how ar you go to deal with that __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ first cut spend __PUNCT__
we let spend get complet out of control __PUNCT__
everybodi talk about rais tax __PUNCT__
i want to keep them low but the point is __PUNCT__ it wasn't tax __PUNCT__ it wa spend __PUNCT__
we presid over the largest increas in the size of govern sinc the great societi and we mortgag our children futur __PUNCT__ to the great disgrac of the republican parti __PUNCT__
we let earmark and corrupt spend get to the point where we mortgag our kid __PUNCT__ futur __PUNCT__
and it go to stop and we have to scrub everi agenc of govern __PUNCT__
we have to bring those troop home from iraq __PUNCT__ which we be save monei as the condit permit them to do so with victori and we have to reform defens procur and we have to do a whole lot of thing but spend be out of control and entitl be veri much out of control __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ have caus the major of our deficit problem along with it be the caus of much of our econom difficulti we in todai __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ includ greedi wall street peopl __PUNCT__ includ congress that didn't do a better job __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ you said yesterdai that you endors an arizona ballot referendum to elimin affirm action __PUNCT__
ten year ago __PUNCT__ you describ a similar effort as __PUNCT__ divis __PUNCT__
what chang __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i don't know what we talk about __PUNCT__
about __NUM__ year ago and i go to look it up __PUNCT__
but i have a clear record of sai that i approv of help peopl progress in america and in the world and i have alwai oppos a quot __PUNCT__ quota __PUNCT__ system __PUNCT__
the best __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ equal opportun employ in america is the unit state militari where we take peopl who join our militari and we give everybodi an opportun and we give them the best train and make them elig for great educ opportun __PUNCT__
the problem in america todai in my view is we condemn peopl who live in poorer commun in america __PUNCT__ whether thei be inner citi or rural area __PUNCT__ to a terribl educ which then limit their opportun __PUNCT__
we got to have choic and competit __PUNCT__
we got to have charter school __PUNCT__
we got to have voucher __PUNCT__
we got to have home school __PUNCT__
we got to give peopl a choic and an opportun __PUNCT__
the same on that senat obama had for hi children and the same opportun that cindi and i had to send our children to the school of our choic and that what we condemn so mani american to todai is educ which will never give them ani the upward mobil and the equal opportun that thei deserv __PUNCT__
so i alwai oppos quota no matter where that quota is taken from __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ we at the end of our agre __PUNCT__ upon time __PUNCT__
on quick thing __PUNCT__ ar you go to campaign a lot with the presid __PUNCT__ will you campaign with him a lot __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i am alwai glad to be in hi compani but the fact is it my campaign as you know and the american peopl didn't get to know me yesterdai and even though i differ on spend __PUNCT__ on climat chang __PUNCT__ on a long rang of issu __PUNCT__ campaign financ reform __PUNCT__
other reform that i have tri to implement on govern __PUNCT__
opposit to earmark spend __PUNCT__
all of those thing __PUNCT__
the american peopl will know me and my agenda for the futur and i am veri happi with where we ar right now __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
and i alwai enjoi be on your show __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ same here __PUNCT__
