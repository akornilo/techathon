thank you __PUNCT__ marc __PUNCT__ for the introduct __PUNCT__
i appreci your kind invit and thi warm welcom to orlando and to the urban leagu __PUNCT__
through all the busi cycl and polit cycl of almost a centuri __PUNCT__ thi organ ha champion an agenda of econom growth and opportun __PUNCT__
you never lost your sens of mission __PUNCT__ or your commit to better the live of african american and of all citizen __PUNCT__
i honor to be with the men and women of the urban leagu __PUNCT__
you hear from my oppon __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ tomorrow __PUNCT__ and if there on thing he alwai deliv it a great speech __PUNCT__
but i hope you listen carefulli __PUNCT__ becaus hi idea ar not alwai as impress as hi rhetor __PUNCT__
and thi is especi true in the case of the urban leagu agenda of opportun __PUNCT__
your opportun compact speak of the urgent need to reform our public school __PUNCT__ creat job __PUNCT__ and help small busi grow __PUNCT__
you understand that persist problem of fail school and econom stagnat cannot be solv with the same tire idea and pander to special interest that have fail us time and again __PUNCT__
and you know how much the challeng have chang for those who champion the caus of equal opportun in america __PUNCT__
equal access to public educ ha been gain __PUNCT__
but what is the valu of access to a fail school __PUNCT__ equal employ opportun is set firmli down in law __PUNCT__
but with job becom scarcer __PUNCT__ and more than __NUM__ american t hrown out of work just thi year __PUNCT__ that can amount to an equal share of diminish opportun __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ busi ownership by african american ha been grow rapidli __PUNCT__
thi is all to the good __PUNCT__ but that hope trend is threaten in a struggl economi __PUNCT__ with the cost of energi __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ and just about everyth els rise sharpli __PUNCT__
as in other challeng african american have overcom __PUNCT__ these problem requir clariti of purpos __PUNCT__
thei requir the solidar of group like the urban leagu __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ at time __PUNCT__ thei also requir a willing to break from convent think __PUNCT__
nowher ar the limit of convent think ani more appar than in educ polici __PUNCT__
after decad of hear the same big promis from the public educ establish __PUNCT__ and se e the same poor result __PUNCT__ it is sure time to shake off old wai and to demand new reform __PUNCT__
that isn't just my opinion __PUNCT__ it is the convict of parent in poor neighborhood across thi nation who want better live for their children __PUNCT__
just ask the famili in new orlean who will soon have the chanc to remov their son and daughter from fail school __PUNCT__ and enrol them instead in a school __PUNCT__ choic scholarship program __PUNCT__
that program in louisiana wa propos by democrat state legisl and sign into law by governor bobbi jindal __PUNCT__
just three year after katrina __PUNCT__ thei ar bring real hope to poor neighborhood __PUNCT__ and show how much can be achiev when both parti work togeth for real reform __PUNCT__
or ask parent in the disadvantag neighborhood of washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ whether thei want more choic in educ __PUNCT__
the district opportun scholarship program serv more than __NUM__ boi and girl from famili with an averag incom of __NUM__ dollar a year __PUNCT__
and more than __NUM__ more famili have appli for that program __PUNCT__
what thei all have in common is the desir to get their kid into a better school __PUNCT__
democrat in congress __PUNCT__ includ my oppon __PUNCT__ oppos the d.c __PUNCT__ opportun scholarship program __PUNCT__
in remark to the american feder of teacher last month __PUNCT__ senat obama dismiss public support for privat school voucher for low __PUNCT__ incom american as __PUNCT__ tire rhetor about voucher and school choic __PUNCT__
all of that went over well with the teacher union __PUNCT__ but where doe it leav famili and their children who ar stuck in fail school __PUNCT__ over the year __PUNCT__ american have heard a lot of __PUNCT__ tire rhetor __PUNCT__ about educ __PUNCT__
we heard it in the endless excus of peopl who seem more concern about their own posit than about our children __PUNCT__
we heard it from politician who accept the statu quo rather than stand up for real chang in our public school __PUNCT__
parent ask onli for school that ar safe __PUNCT__ teacher who ar compet __PUNCT__ and diploma that open door of opportun __PUNCT__
when a public school fail __PUNCT__ repeatedli __PUNCT__ to meet these minim object __PUNCT__ parent ask onli for a choic in the educ of their children __PUNCT__
some parent mai choos a better public school __PUNCT__
some mai choos a privat school __PUNCT__
mani will choos a charter school __PUNCT__
no entrench bureaucraci or union should deni parent that choic and children that opportun __PUNCT__
we should also offer more choic to those who wish to becom teacher __PUNCT__
mani thousand of highli qualifi men and women have great knowledg __PUNCT__ wisdom __PUNCT__ and experi to offer public school student __PUNCT__
but a monopoli on teacher certif prevent them from get that chanc __PUNCT__
you can be a nobel laureat and not qualifi to teach in most public school todai becaus thei don't have all the proper credit in educ __PUNCT__ theori __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ methodolog __PUNCT__
all thei have is learn and the desir and abil to share it __PUNCT__
if we put the interest of student first __PUNCT__ then those qualif should be enough __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ school choic for all who want it __PUNCT__ an expans of opportun scholarship __PUNCT__ and altern certif for teacher will all be part of a seriou agenda of educ reform __PUNCT__
i will target fund to recruit teacher who graduat in the top __NUM__ percent of their class __PUNCT__ or who particip in an altern teacher recruit program such as teach for america __PUNCT__ the american board for certif of teacher excel __PUNCT__ and the new teacher project __PUNCT__
we will pai bonus to teacher who take on the challeng of work in our most troubl school __PUNCT__ becaus we need their fine mind and good heart to help turn those school around __PUNCT__
we will award bonus as well to our highest __PUNCT__ achiev teacher __PUNCT__
and no longer will we measur teacher achiev by conform to process __PUNCT__
we will measur it by the success of their student __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ the fund for these bonus will not be control by farawai offici __PUNCT__ in washington __PUNCT__ in a state capit __PUNCT__ or even in a district offic __PUNCT__
under my reform __PUNCT__ we will put the monei and the respons where thei belong __PUNCT__ in the offic of the school princip __PUNCT__
on reason charter school ar so success __PUNCT__ and so sought after by parent __PUNCT__ is that princip have spend discret __PUNCT__
and i intend to give that same discret to public school princip __PUNCT__
no longer will monei be spent on rigid and often meaningless formula __PUNCT__
reli on the good judgment and first __PUNCT__ hand knowledg of school princip __PUNCT__ educ monei will be spent in servic to public school student __PUNCT__
under my reform __PUNCT__ parent will exercis freedom of choic in obtain extra help for children who ar fall behind __PUNCT__
as it is __PUNCT__ feder aid to parent for tutor for their children ha to go through anoth bureaucraci __PUNCT__
thei can't purchas the tutor directli __PUNCT__ without deal with the same educ establish that fail their children in the first place __PUNCT__
these needless restrict will be remov __PUNCT__
if a student need extra help __PUNCT__ parent will be abl to sign them up to get it __PUNCT__ with direct public support __PUNCT__
some of these reform __PUNCT__ and other __PUNCT__ ar contain in a statement of principl draft by a group dedic to final chang the statu quo in our educ system __PUNCT__
the educ equal project ha brought togeth leader from all across the polit spectrum __PUNCT__ includ school chancellor joel klein and mayor michael bloomberg of new york citi __PUNCT__
chancellor klein is a strong support of charter school __PUNCT__ becaus he understand that fundament reform is need __PUNCT__
as he put it __PUNCT__ in larg urban area the cultur of public educ is broken __PUNCT__
if you don't fix thi cultur __PUNCT__ then you ar not go to be abl to make the kind of chang that ar need __PUNCT__
among other who share thi convict ar mayor cori booker of newark __PUNCT__ chancellor michel rhee of washington __PUNCT__ and harold ford __PUNCT__ junior __PUNCT__
you know that a reform movement is truli bipartisan when j.c __PUNCT__ watt and al sharpton ar both member __PUNCT__
and todai i am proud to add my name as well to the list of those who support the aim and principl of the educ equal project __PUNCT__
but on name is still miss __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__
my oppon talk a great deal about hope and chang __PUNCT__ and educ is as good a test as ani of hi serious __PUNCT__
the educ equal project is a practic plan for deliv chang and restor hope for children and parent who need a lot of both __PUNCT__
and if senat obama continu to defer to the teacher union __PUNCT__ instead of commit to real reform __PUNCT__ then he should start look for new slogan __PUNCT__
over the year __PUNCT__ the urban leagu ha brought enorm good into the life of our countri __PUNCT__ by broaden the reach of econom opportun __PUNCT__
there wa a time when economist took littl if ani notic at all of the poverti of black commun __PUNCT__
even in time of gener econom growth __PUNCT__ mani live in a per petual recess __PUNCT__ and the job avail didn't promis much upward mobil __PUNCT__
our countri still ha a lot of progress to make on thi score __PUNCT__
but with __NUM__ million busi todai own and oper by african american __PUNCT__ more and more ar no longer just spectat on the prosper of our countri __PUNCT__
thei ar stakehold __PUNCT__
as much as anyon els __PUNCT__ thei count on their govern to help creat the condit of econom growth __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i intend to do just that __PUNCT__
senat obama and i have fundament differ on econom polici __PUNCT__ and mani of them concern tax rate __PUNCT__
he support propos to rais top margin rate paid by small busi and famili __PUNCT__ to rais tax rate on those with taxabl incom of more than __NUM__ dollar __PUNCT__ rais capit gain tax __PUNCT__ rais tax on dividend __PUNCT__ rais payrol tax and rais estat tax __PUNCT__
that a whole lot of rais __PUNCT__ and for million s of famili __PUNCT__ individu __PUNCT__ and small busi it will mean a lot less monei to spend __PUNCT__ save and invest as thei see fit __PUNCT__
for my part __PUNCT__ i believ that in a troubl economi __PUNCT__ when folk ar struggl to afford the necess of life __PUNCT__ higher tax ar the last thing we need __PUNCT__
the economi isn't hurt becaus worker and busi ar under __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__
rais tax elimin job __PUNCT__ hurt small busi __PUNCT__ and delai econom recoveri __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ we will preserv the current low rate as thei ar __PUNCT__ so busi larg and small can hire more peopl __PUNCT__
we will doubl the person exempt from __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ for everi depend __PUNCT__ in everi famili in america __PUNCT__
we will offer everi individu and famili a larg tax credit to bui their health care __PUNCT__ so employ can spend more on wage __PUNCT__ and wo rker don't lose their coverag when thei chang job __PUNCT__
we will lower the busi tax rate __PUNCT__ so american compani open new plant and creat more job in thi countri __PUNCT__
there ar honest differ as well about the growth of govern __PUNCT__
but sure we can find common ground in the principl that govern cannot go on forev spend recklessli and incur debt __PUNCT__
govern ha grown by __NUM__ percent in the last eight year __PUNCT__ becaus the congress and thi administr have fail to meet their respons __PUNCT__
and next year __PUNCT__ total feder expenditur ar predict to reach over three trillion dollar __PUNCT__
that is an aw lot for us to be spend when thi nation is alreadi more than nine trillion dollar in debt or more than thirti thousand dollar in debt for everi citizen __PUNCT__
that a debt our govern plan to leav for your children and mine to bear __PUNCT__
and that is a failur n ot onli of financi foresight __PUNCT__ but of moral oblig __PUNCT__
there will come a dai when the road reach a dead __PUNCT__ end __PUNCT__
and it won't be todai politician who suffer the consequ __PUNCT__
it will be american worker and their children who ar left with worthless promis and trillion __PUNCT__ dollar debt __PUNCT__
we cannot let that happen __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i work with everi member of congress __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ and independ __PUNCT__ who share my commit to reform govern and control spend __PUNCT__
i order a top __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ bottom review of everi feder program __PUNCT__ depart __PUNCT__ and agenc __PUNCT__
we go to demand account __PUNCT__
we go to make sure fail program ar not reward __PUNCT__ and that discretionari spend is go where it belong __PUNCT__ to essenti prioriti like job train __PUNCT__ the secur of our citizen __PUNCT__ and the care of our veteran __PUNCT__
to get our economi run at full strength again __PUNCT__ we need to stai focus on creat job for our peopl __PUNCT__ and protect paycheck from the rise cost of food __PUNCT__ gasolin __PUNCT__ and most everyth els __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ we need to get a handl on the cost of oil and gasolin __PUNCT__ and to regain energi independ for america __PUNCT__
all across our countri __PUNCT__ peopl ar hurt __PUNCT__
small farmer __PUNCT__ trucker __PUNCT__ and taxi driver ar unabl to cover their cost __PUNCT__
small busi owner ar struggl to meet their payrol __PUNCT__
the cost of live is rise __PUNCT__ and the valu of paycheck is fall __PUNCT__
yet even now __PUNCT__ with the price of gasolin still around four dollar per gallon __PUNCT__ the congress ha done exactli noth __PUNCT__
most american understand that produc more of someth will lower it price __PUNCT__
and if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ thi nation will move quickli to increas our own energi product __PUNCT__
last month __PUNCT__ the presid final lift the execut ban on offshor oil and ga explor __PUNCT__ and call on congress to lift it ban as well __PUNCT__
lift that ban could serious lower the price of oil __PUNCT__ and congress should get it done immedi __PUNCT__
we need to drill more __PUNCT__ drill now __PUNCT__ and pai less at the pump __PUNCT__
under my energi plan __PUNCT__ the lexington project __PUNCT__ we will also make us of america vast coal reserv __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will commit thi nation to a concert effort to make clean coal a realiti and creat job in hard __PUNCT__ press region __PUNCT__
and america will pursu the goal of build __NUM__ nuclear power plant befor __NUM__ which will gener not onli much __PUNCT__ need electr but some __NUM__ job as well __PUNCT__
we will also acceler the develop of wind and solar power and other renew technolog __PUNCT__ and we will help automak design and sell car that don't depend on gasolin __PUNCT__
product of hybrid __PUNCT__ flex __PUNCT__ fuel __PUNCT__ and electr car will bring america closer to energi independ __PUNCT__
and it will bring job to auto plant __PUNCT__ part manufactur __PUNCT__ and the commun that support them __PUNCT__
regain control over the cost and suppli of energi in america will not be easi __PUNCT__ and it will not happen quickli __PUNCT__
but no challeng to our economi is more urgent __PUNCT__
and you have my pledg that if i am presid __PUNCT__ we go to get it done __PUNCT__
our countri is pass through a veri tough time __PUNCT__
but american have been through wors __PUNCT__ and beaten longer odd __PUNCT__
the men and women of the urban leagu know more than most about face long odd __PUNCT__ and overcom advers __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ thi organ ha been at the center of the great and honor caus of equal opportun for everi american __PUNCT__
i here todai as an admir and a fellow american __PUNCT__ an associ that mean more to me than ani other __PUNCT__
i am a candid for presid who seek your vote and hope to earn it __PUNCT__
but whether or not i win your support __PUNCT__ i need your goodwil and counsel __PUNCT__
and should i succe __PUNCT__ i need it all the more __PUNCT__
i have alwai believ in thi countri __PUNCT__ in a good america __PUNCT__ a great america __PUNCT__
but i have alwai known we can build a better america __PUNCT__ where no place or person is left without hope or opportun by the sin of injustic or indiffer __PUNCT__
it would be among the great privileg of my life to work with you in that caus __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
