it is inde an honor to be here todai at miami children hospit __PUNCT__
i am humbl to be in the presenc of a group that ha displai such overwhelm strength __PUNCT__ fortitud __PUNCT__ and love of life __PUNCT__
and i look forward to hear your stori __PUNCT__ stori that will be a testament as well to the power of innov and medic scienc to improv our live __PUNCT__
i join with all american in look forward to a futur of excit breakthrough __PUNCT__ explor of the human genom __PUNCT__ and technolog advanc __PUNCT__
the vibranc of american medic scienc is the envi of the world __PUNCT__
advanc of thi sort allow an infant born with complex congenit heart diseas to surviv and thrive __PUNCT__ a vigor young boi to surviv an aw accid __PUNCT__ and anoth to fight the ravag of brain cancer __PUNCT__
our medic profession have develop surgic procedur to correct bilater cleft __PUNCT__ and our medic devic industri invent innov breath support __PUNCT__
but those effort ar surpass by the willing of american famili to overcom obstacl __PUNCT__ take respons for their futur __PUNCT__ and look forward to a better life __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i pledg to preserv the foundat that deliv innov and hope to those who ar in need of modern medicin __PUNCT__
i will work to elimin the worri over the avail and cost of health care that troubl the wake hour and disturb the sleep of more american than ani other singl domest issu __PUNCT__
despit it mani virtu __PUNCT__ the health care system as a whole doe not mirror the success in thi room __PUNCT__
as a nation __PUNCT__ we do not uniformli deliv the best possibl care __PUNCT__
shortfal in patient safeti and medic error remain a danger realiti __PUNCT__ and too mani american do not have health insur __PUNCT__
but most importantli __PUNCT__ our health care is too expens __PUNCT__
we spend a stagger amount of monei on health care __PUNCT__ over __MONEY__ trillion and almost twice as much as ani other countri per person __PUNCT__
within the decad total health care spend will more than doubl and consum nearli on out of everi five dollar in america __PUNCT__
these cost ar a threat to the abil of american to have health insur __PUNCT__ the gatewai to better health care __PUNCT__
these cost ar a threat as well to the abil of american worker to build a better life __PUNCT__
rise cost of health care and health insur have squeez the wage that worker earn and consum the budget of their famili __PUNCT__
i have devot much of my campaign to a discuss with american of my commit to better care __PUNCT__ at lower cost __PUNCT__ for all american __PUNCT__
i understand how import it is for famili to be in control of their health care system __PUNCT__ and not the revers __PUNCT__
and i want to help chart the right path to that laudabl goal __PUNCT__
i am convinc that the wrong wai to go is to turn over your live to the govern and hope it will all be fine __PUNCT__
it won't __PUNCT__
that rout ignor the lesson of other countri where govern pai the bill __PUNCT__ but real peopl pai a deeper cost through long wait for treatment or settl for care that doe not take advantag of the latest medic scienc __PUNCT__
it ignor the lesson of our own experi where medicar beneficiari have __PUNCT__ access __PUNCT__ on paper while doctor stop take patient __PUNCT__ where our promis to take care of our veteran is betrai by inaccess locat and long line __PUNCT__
my approach to transform health care is to put famili in charg __PUNCT__
i believ american want to be part of a system that offer better care at lower cost for all american __PUNCT__ and that respect their individu digniti __PUNCT__
we must reform the health care system to make it respons to the need of american famili __PUNCT__
not the govern __PUNCT__
not the insur compani __PUNCT__
not tort lawyer __PUNCT__
not even the doctor and hospit __PUNCT__
the next presid will have to take on the parochi interest that thrive in the health care system __PUNCT__
doctor must do a better job of manag our care and keep us healthi and out of hospit and nurs home __PUNCT__
we will need altern to doctor __PUNCT__ offic and emerg room __PUNCT__
hospit must do a better job of take care of us when we ar there __PUNCT__ commit fewer deadli and costli medic error and gener oper more effici __PUNCT__
pharmaceut compani must worri less about squeez addit profit from old medicin by copi the last success drug and insist on addit patent protect and focu more on new and innov medicin __PUNCT__
insur compani should spend more on medic care and less on __PUNCT__ administr __PUNCT__
we must move awai from a system that is fragment and pai for expens procedur toward on where a famili ha a medic home __PUNCT__ provid coordin their effort and take advantag of technolog to do so cheapli __PUNCT__ and where the focu is on afford qualiti outcom __PUNCT__
america can have a health care system that is character by better prevent __PUNCT__ coordin care __PUNCT__ electron health record __PUNCT__ cut __PUNCT__ edg treatment __PUNCT__ and lower cost __PUNCT__
america can have a health insur system that innov to provid polici that meet the need of famili __PUNCT__ and that travel with american from job to job __PUNCT__
govern can plai it part with public health program that teach the need for person respons to address chronic diseas __PUNCT__ especi with the epidem of obes among our adult and children __PUNCT__
we should again teach nutrit and physic educ to our children __PUNCT__ and better inform adult what our food contain and the import of exercis __PUNCT__
we can build a health care system that is more respons to our need and is deliv to more peopl at lower cost __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ solut __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ isn't a on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit __PUNCT__ all __PUNCT__ big govern takeov of health care __PUNCT__
it resid where everi import social advanc ha alwai resid __PUNCT__ with the american peopl themselv __PUNCT__ with well inform american famili __PUNCT__ make practic decis to address their imper for better health and more secur prosper __PUNCT__
the engin of our prosper and progress ha alwai been our freedom and the sens of respons for and control of our own destini that freedom requir __PUNCT__
the public trust in govern wax and wane __PUNCT__
but we have alwai trust in ourselv to meet ani challeng that requir onli our ingenu and industri to surmount __PUNCT__
ani __PUNCT__ solut __PUNCT__ that rob us of that essenti sens of ourselv is a cure far wors than the afflict it is meant to treat __PUNCT__
