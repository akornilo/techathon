thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ nietzel __PUNCT__ i appreci the introduct __PUNCT__ and the warm welcom to missouri state __PUNCT__
we have some distinguish guest here todai __PUNCT__
and on of them is a son of missouri who went on to becom our suprem alli command in europ __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ gener jame jone __PUNCT__
i here to learn about energi issu as well as to talk __PUNCT__
so let me just offer a few thought befor we turn to our panel and then take some question __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ peopl have been worri and talk about america energi problem sinc long befor the student here were even born __PUNCT__
a lot of folk in washington ar still talk about it too __PUNCT__ talk is what thei do __PUNCT__
but thi nation cannot afford to put off seriou energi reform ani longer __PUNCT__
for the sake of our economi __PUNCT__ for the sake of our environ __PUNCT__ and for the sake of our nation secur __PUNCT__ we need to get it done and get it right __PUNCT__
all across thi state and nation __PUNCT__ peopl ar hurt __PUNCT__
small farmer __PUNCT__ trucker __PUNCT__ and taxi driver ar unabl to cover their cost __PUNCT__
small busi owner ar struggl to meet payrol __PUNCT__
the cost of live is rise __PUNCT__ and the valu of paycheck is fall __PUNCT__
all of thi __PUNCT__ in larg part __PUNCT__ becaus the price of oil is too high __PUNCT__ and the suppli of oil is too uncertain __PUNCT__
work american rightli believ their govern ha a duti to final assur the energi secur of thi countri __PUNCT__
even on extra penni at the pump cost our peopl a total of on billion dollar more in a singl year __PUNCT__
and there ar other cost to our economi as well __PUNCT__ like the effect of oil import on our trade deficit __PUNCT__
petroleum __PUNCT__ relat import came to __NUM__ billion dollar last year __PUNCT__ and the bill keep rise __PUNCT__
we ar actual borrow from foreign lender to bui oil from foreign produc __PUNCT__
over time __PUNCT__ in interest payment __PUNCT__ we have lost trillion of dollar that could have been better invest in american enterpris __PUNCT__
the sum effect of these intern deficit is a weaker dollar that undermin confid in the american economi __PUNCT__
the weak dollar is a further tax on the economi in the form of higher price for everyth we import __PUNCT__ includ oil itself __PUNCT__
and we wind up caught between the rock of slower growth and the hard place of inflat __PUNCT__
for hi part __PUNCT__ senat obama ha a differ outlook on all of thi __PUNCT__
instead of new energi product __PUNCT__ he want new energi tax __PUNCT__
and he against ani tax relief to give folk a break at the pump __PUNCT__
i notic a pattern here __PUNCT__
when the speechmak is over and you stop to figur out what all the rhetor realli amount to __PUNCT__ the answer is usual some new tax __PUNCT__
for senat obama __PUNCT__ the solut to everi problem and the answer to everi challeng is a new tax __PUNCT__
and he is convinc that a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ style windfal profit tax is just what america need in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
but it pretti clear to most of us that when it come to energi __PUNCT__ what we realli need is to produc more __PUNCT__ us less __PUNCT__ and find new sourc of power __PUNCT__
the next presid must be will to break with the energi polici not just of the current administr __PUNCT__ but the administr that preced it __PUNCT__ and lead a great nation campaign to achiev energi secur for america __PUNCT__
in the short term __PUNCT__ thi requir more domest product __PUNCT__ especi in the outer continent shelf __PUNCT__
we need to encourag product in wai that ar consist with sensibl standard of environment protect __PUNCT__
and in state that permit explor __PUNCT__ there must be a share of benefit between state and feder govern __PUNCT__
but as a matter of fair to the american peopl __PUNCT__ we must assur afford fuel for america by increas domest product __PUNCT__
when i announc thi polici the other dai __PUNCT__ senat obama wast no time in mischaracter it __PUNCT__
he describ my posit as __PUNCT__ you guess it __PUNCT__ anoth exampl of bush third term __PUNCT__
i guess the senat ha chang hi posit sinc vote for the __NUM__ bush energi bill __PUNCT__ a grab __PUNCT__ bag of corpor handout that i oppos __PUNCT__
come to think of it __PUNCT__ that energi bill wa the onli time we ever seen senat obama vote in favor of ani tax break __PUNCT__ and it wa a tax break for the oil compani __PUNCT__
in the big pictur __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ more domest product of oil is onli part of the solut __PUNCT__
we need a fresh start as well to meet america grow electr need __PUNCT__
and if we look for a vast suppli of reliabl and low __PUNCT__ cost electr __PUNCT__ with zero carbon emiss and long __PUNCT__ term price stabil __PUNCT__ that the work definit of nuclear energi __PUNCT__
on obstacl to expand our nuclear __PUNCT__ power electr is the mindset of those who prefer to bui time and hope that our energi problem will somehow solv themselv __PUNCT__
it ha a lot more to do with the polit of matter than with the merit __PUNCT__
and you can observ thi approach even in the case of the senat from the state with more nuclear power plant than ani other __PUNCT__
senat obama sai __PUNCT__ i am not a nuclear energi propon __PUNCT__
i think that make him a nuclear energi oppon __PUNCT__ though he doe have a knack for nuanc and it not entir clear __PUNCT__
in ani case __PUNCT__ i am a propon of thi clean __PUNCT__ safe __PUNCT__ and effici sourc of energi __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we have __NUM__ nuclear reactor in our countri __PUNCT__ gener about twenti percent of our electr __PUNCT__
everi year __PUNCT__ these reactor alon spare the atmospher from the equival of nearli all auto emiss in america __PUNCT__
yet for all these benefit __PUNCT__ we have not broken ground on a singl nuclear plant in over thirti year __PUNCT__
and our manufactur base to even construct these plant is almost gone __PUNCT__
china __PUNCT__ russia __PUNCT__ and india ar all plan to build more than a hundr new power plant among them in the come decad __PUNCT__
across europ there ar __NUM__ reactor in oper __PUNCT__ and nation includ franc and belgium deriv more than half their electr from nuclear power __PUNCT__
and if all of these nation can find a wai to carri out great goal in energi polici __PUNCT__ then i assur you that the unit state is more than equal to the challeng __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i will set thi nation on a cours to build __NUM__ new reactor by the year __NUM__ with the ultim goal of __NUM__ new plant to power the home and factori and citi of america __PUNCT__
thi task will be as difficult as it is necessari __PUNCT__
we will need to recov all the knowledg and skill that have been lost over three stagnant decad in a highli technic field __PUNCT__
we will need to solv complex problem of move and store materi that will alwai need safeguard __PUNCT__
we will need to do all of these thing __PUNCT__ and do them right __PUNCT__ as we have done great thing befor __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we must invest more in the great task of acquir clean __PUNCT__ coal technolog __PUNCT__
coal is a strateg nation resourc __PUNCT__ and todai provid most of our nation electr __PUNCT__ and about __NUM__ percent here in missouri __PUNCT__
burn coal cleanli is a challeng of practic problem solv and human ingenu __PUNCT__ and we have no shortag of those in thi countri __PUNCT__
perhap no advanc in energi technolog could mean more to america than the clean burn of coal and the captur and storag of carbon emiss __PUNCT__
and to thi end __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will commit two billion dollar each year on clean __PUNCT__ coal research and develop __PUNCT__
we will build the demonstr plant __PUNCT__ refin the techniqu and equip __PUNCT__ and make clean coal a realiti __PUNCT__
thi singl achiev will open vast amount of our oldest and most abund resourc __PUNCT__
and it will deliv not onli electr but job to some of the area hardest hit by our ec onom troubl __PUNCT__
the good that clean coal can do extend around the world __PUNCT__ and into it ski __PUNCT__
onc we suppli the mean of clean __PUNCT__ burn coal and carbon captur __PUNCT__ nation everywher will pursu the same end __PUNCT__ abund energi with low carbon emiss __PUNCT__
china in particular ha enorm coal reserv that could power it continu econom growth cleanli and effici __PUNCT__
and by master the technolog __PUNCT__ america will lead the wai __PUNCT__
in the progress of other altern energi sourc __PUNCT__ such as wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ geotherm __PUNCT__ tide __PUNCT__ and hydroelectr __PUNCT__ govern must be an alli but not an arbit __PUNCT__
in less than a gener __PUNCT__ wind power alon could account for a fifth or more of all our electr __PUNCT__
and just in recent memori __PUNCT__ solar energi ha gone from a novelti to a fast __PUNCT__ grow industri __PUNCT__
i vote against the current patchwork of tax credit for renew power becaus thei were temporari __PUNCT__ and often the result of who had the best lobbyist instead of who had the best idea __PUNCT__
but the object itself wa right and urgent __PUNCT__
and when i sign law __PUNCT__ instead of cast on of a hundr vote __PUNCT__ i intend to see that object better serv __PUNCT__
we will reform thi effort so that it is fair __PUNCT__ ration __PUNCT__ and perman __PUNCT__ let the market decid which idea can move us toward clean and renew energi __PUNCT__
we american like to sai that there is no problem we can't solv __PUNCT__ howev complic __PUNCT__ and no obstacl we cannot overcom if we meet it togeth __PUNCT__
i believ thi about our countri __PUNCT__
i know thi about our countri __PUNCT__
and now it is time to show those qualiti onc again __PUNCT__
i thank you all for your kind attent __PUNCT__ and now let me turn you over to my friend on the panel __PUNCT__
