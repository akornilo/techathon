i will not plai along with the same washington game and gimmick that got us into thi terribl mess in the first place __PUNCT__
i am go to washington to fight for you __PUNCT__
i will begin by make certain that the __NUM__ billion dollar alreadi commit to econom recoveri is not us to further enrich the veri peopl and institut that invit these troubl with their own reckless conduct __PUNCT__
instead of just prop up institut deem __PUNCT__ too big to fail __PUNCT__ in thi crisi __PUNCT__ we will us more of thi public monei to help busi and homeown that mai be too small to surviv __PUNCT__
thi financi crisi start with our hous crisi __PUNCT__ and we cannot fix our market and the economi until we fix the hous crisi __PUNCT__

with so much on the line __PUNCT__ the moment requir that govern act __PUNCT__ and as presid i intend to act __PUNCT__ quickli and decis __PUNCT__
when the govern doe provid fund to shore up compani __PUNCT__ the term will be demand __PUNCT__ there will be complet transpar and the safeti net for our financi system will not becom a golden parachut for fail execut __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ we will not mere inject billion of dollar into compani and walk awai hope for the best __PUNCT__
we will requir that those compani be reform and restructur until thei ar sound asset again __PUNCT__ and can be sold at no loss __PUNCT__ or perhap even a profit __PUNCT__ to the taxpay of america __PUNCT__
and when that is accomplish __PUNCT__ in each instanc __PUNCT__ govern will relinquish it interest in these privat compani __PUNCT__
we go to get govern out of the busi of bailout and equiti stake __PUNCT__ and back in the busi of respons regul __PUNCT__
we will learn from thi crisi to prevent the next on __PUNCT__ with much stricter oversight __PUNCT__
no more wild overleverag __PUNCT__ no more liabil conceal from the public and from sharehold __PUNCT__ no more bundl of asset to maxim profit by assum insan risk __PUNCT__
those dai ar over on wall street __PUNCT__
with new rule of public disclosur and account __PUNCT__ my reform will make certain these betray of sharehold and the public trust ar never repeat __PUNCT__
we must restor trust to our financi system __PUNCT__
on my order __PUNCT__ the depart of the treasuri will guarante on hundr percent of all save account for a period of six month __PUNCT__
thi will calm the understand fear of widespread bank failur __PUNCT__ while also restor ration judgment to the choic of the market __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will also act to protect investor __PUNCT__ especi those reli on their invest for retir __PUNCT__
current rule mandat that investor must begin to sell off their ira and 401k when thei reach ag __NUM__ and on half year old __PUNCT__
those rule should be suspend to spare senior citizen from be forc to sell their stock just as the market is hurt the most __PUNCT__
under the emerg measur i propos __PUNCT__ we will also cut the tax rate for withdraw from tax __PUNCT__ prefer retir account to ten percent __PUNCT__
retire have suffer enough and need relief __PUNCT__ and the surest relief is to let them keep more of their own save __PUNCT__
it is essenti that we avoid an exodu of capit from the market __PUNCT__
senat obama yesterdai offer up a propos that would have the effect of encourag earli withdraw of fund from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ k __PUNCT__ account __PUNCT__ by suspend penalti through __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi is an invit to capit flight __PUNCT__ and therefor to continu instabl in the market __PUNCT__ at a moment when exactli the opposit is need __PUNCT__
ani famili that take part in thi will not see the benefit of the market recoveri that smart polici can help bring about __PUNCT__
in my administr __PUNCT__ we will instead reviv the market by attract new invest __PUNCT__
i will cut in half the capit gain tax on stock purchas and held for more than a year __PUNCT__ from a rate of __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
thi vital measur will promot bui __PUNCT__ rais asset valu __PUNCT__ help compani and shore up the pension plan for worker and retire __PUNCT__
we should also not penal american who ar forc to sell invest in todai tough market __PUNCT__
i will increas the amount of capit loss from __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ which can be deduct from your ordinari incom in tax year __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so much of thi declin in our market and valu destruct wa due to the failur of congress and the administr to come out with a time rescu packag __PUNCT__
investor ar alwai respons for their invest decis __PUNCT__ but the hard earn save of american should not be penal by the errat behavior of politician __PUNCT__
it will not be enough for the feder govern to correct the excess of wall street without reform it own reckless practic __PUNCT__
spend in washington is out of control and i am go to rein it in __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will veto the pork barrel special interest project that ar wast your tax dollar __PUNCT__ drive up our debt __PUNCT__ and weaken our dollar __PUNCT__
i have propos a on year spend freez with certain except for such thing as defens and veteran care __PUNCT__
we ar go to us that year to turn washington insid out and get rid of wast __PUNCT__ ineffici program that do no on ani good __PUNCT__
while we put govern back on your side __PUNCT__ we must reform our tax system to deliv need tax relief to work american __PUNCT__ and to creat job __PUNCT__
i will doubl the child deduct __PUNCT__ from __NUM__ dollar to __NUM__ dollar __PUNCT__
everi person in america who choos it will receiv a __NUM__ dollar toward the purchas of health insur __PUNCT__ health plan that will be their to keep __PUNCT__ even if thei chang job or move to anoth state __PUNCT__
and we will reduc the feder busi tax rate from __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the second __PUNCT__ highest in the world __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
i am also propos todai that for those who ar between job __PUNCT__ we elimin all tax on unemploy benefit __PUNCT__
it is unclear to me why the govern tax monei it ha just sent you __PUNCT__ and we should reliev thi burden from american who been hit the hardest __PUNCT__
reduc busi tax rate ha the potenti to stop and revers the rise of unemploy __PUNCT__ and could creat million of new job __PUNCT__
despit the frequent chang to my oppon tax plan in recent month __PUNCT__ he seem to revis them with each new poll __PUNCT__ hi plan to rais tax on __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of small busi incom ha surviv __PUNCT__
and even as he rail against compani that shut down their plant and move oversea __PUNCT__ he refus to cut the tax rate that drive mani of these compani awai __PUNCT__
a typic middl __PUNCT__ class famili of four make __NUM__ dollar a year with health insur will get __NUM__ more dollar under my plan than thei would under senat obama plan __PUNCT__
that exampl of __NUM__ a year in wage is especi relev __PUNCT__ becaus just last year senat obama vote to rais tax on individu make that amount __PUNCT__
senat obama is also the same fellow who request a million dollar a dai in pork barrel earmark __PUNCT__
who think that wast __NUM__ billion dollar a year in earmark is not worth worri about __PUNCT__ who propos a near doubl of the tax on dividend and capit gain dure the primari __PUNCT__ who ha vote __NUM__ time for tax increas or against tax cut __PUNCT__ who is promis almost a trillion dollar in new spend __PUNCT__ who came to the senat a few year ago and alreadi earn the titl of it most liber member __PUNCT__ thi is the man who now present himself as a tax cutter and champion of middl __PUNCT__ class america __PUNCT__
he is an eloqu speaker __PUNCT__ but even he can't turn a record of support higher tax into a credibl promis to cut tax __PUNCT__
what he promis todai is the opposit of what he ha done hi entir career __PUNCT__
perhap never befor in histori have the american peopl been ask to risk so much base on so littl __PUNCT__
you can look at the record of what he done or you can just go with your gut __PUNCT__ but either wai you left with the same conclus __PUNCT__ senat obama is go to rais your tax __PUNCT__
and in thi economi __PUNCT__ rais tax is the surest wai to turn a recess into a depress __PUNCT__
senat obama also promis to restrict intern trade and risk access to foreign market for american good and servic __PUNCT__
the last presid to rais tax and restrict trade in a bad economi wa herbert hoover __PUNCT__
that didn't turn out to well __PUNCT__
thei sai those who fail to learn the lesson of histori ar doom to repeat them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i know my histori lesson __PUNCT__ and i sure won't make the mistak senat obama will __PUNCT__
and were my oppon elect with a democrat congress in power __PUNCT__ not onli would there be no check on my oppon reckless econom polici __PUNCT__ there would be consider pressur on him to tax and spend even more __PUNCT__
thi weekend __PUNCT__ a plumber concern that senat obama wa go to rais hi tax ask him directli about hi plan __PUNCT__
the respons wa tell __PUNCT__
senat obama explain to him that he wa go to rais hi tax to quot __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
thi explain how senat obama can promis an incom tax cut for million who aren't even pai incom tax right now __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ my plan isn't intend to forc small busi to cut job to pai higher tax so we can __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
my plan is intend to creat job and increas the wealth of all american __PUNCT__
my plan for econom recoveri doe not requir guesswork or blind faith from the american peopl __PUNCT__
you know my record __PUNCT__
you don't have to hope i will do what i promis __PUNCT__
when i sai i will cut spend __PUNCT__ you need onli look at my record to know it true __PUNCT__
