onli a fool or a fraud sentiment the merciless realiti of war __PUNCT__
howev headi the appeal of a call to arm __PUNCT__ howev just the caus __PUNCT__ we should still shed a tear for all that is lost when war claim it wage from us __PUNCT__
i am an idealist __PUNCT__ and i believ it is possibl in our time to make the world we live in anoth __PUNCT__ better __PUNCT__ more peac place __PUNCT__ where our interest and those of our alli ar more secur __PUNCT__ and american ideal that ar transform the world __PUNCT__ the principl of free peopl and free market __PUNCT__ advanc even farther than thei have __PUNCT__
but i am __PUNCT__ from hard experi and the judgment it inform __PUNCT__ a realist idealist __PUNCT__
i know we must work veri hard and veri creativ to build new foundat for a stabl and endur peac __PUNCT__
we cannot wish the world to be a better place than it is __PUNCT__
we have enemi for whom no attack is too cruel __PUNCT__ and no innoc life safe __PUNCT__ and who would __PUNCT__ if thei could __PUNCT__ strike us with the world most terribl weapon __PUNCT__
there ar state that support them __PUNCT__ and which might help them acquir those weapon becaus thei share with terrorist the same anim hatr for the west __PUNCT__ and will not be placat by fresh appeal to the better angel of their natur __PUNCT__
thi is the central threat of our time __PUNCT__ and we must understand the implic of our decis on all manner of region and global challeng could have for our success in defeat it __PUNCT__
presid harri truman onc said of america __PUNCT__ god ha creat us and brought us to our present posit of power and strength for some great purpos __PUNCT__
in hi time __PUNCT__ that purpos wa to contain commun and build the structur of peac and prosper that could provid safe passag through the cold war __PUNCT__
now it is our turn __PUNCT__
we face a new set of opportun __PUNCT__ and also new danger __PUNCT__
the develop of scienc and technolog have brought us untold prosper __PUNCT__ erad diseas __PUNCT__ and reduc the suffer of million __PUNCT__
we have a chanc in our lifetim to rais the world to a new standard of human exist __PUNCT__
yet these same technolog have produc grave new risk __PUNCT__ arm a few zealot with the abil to murder million of innoc __PUNCT__ and produc a global industri that can in time threaten our planet __PUNCT__
to meet thi challeng requir understand the world we live in __PUNCT__ and the central role the unit state must plai in shape it for the futur __PUNCT__
the unit state must lead in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ just as in truman dai __PUNCT__
but leadership todai mean someth differ than it did in the year after world war ii __PUNCT__ when europ and the other democraci were still recov from the devast of war and the unit state wa the onli democrat superpow __PUNCT__
todai we ar not alon __PUNCT__
there is the power collect voic of the european union __PUNCT__ and there ar the great nation of india and japan __PUNCT__ australia and brazil __PUNCT__ south korea and south africa __PUNCT__ turkei and israel __PUNCT__ to name just a few of the lead democraci __PUNCT__
there ar also the increasingli power nation of china and russia that wield great influenc in the intern system __PUNCT__
in such a world __PUNCT__ where power of all kind is more wide and evenli distribut __PUNCT__ the unit state cannot lead by virtu of it power alon __PUNCT__
we must be strong polit __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ and militarili __PUNCT__
but we must also lead by attract other to our caus __PUNCT__ by demonstr onc again the virtu of freedom and democraci __PUNCT__ by defend the rule of intern civil societi and by creat the new intern institut necessari to advanc the peac and freedom we cherish __PUNCT__
perhap abov all __PUNCT__ leadership in todai world mean accept and fulfil our respons as a great nation __PUNCT__
on of those respons is to be a good and reliabl alli to our fellow democraci __PUNCT__
we cannot build an endur peac base on freedom by ourselv __PUNCT__ and we do not want to __PUNCT__
we have to strengthen our global allianc as the core of a new global compact __PUNCT__ a leagu of democraci __PUNCT__ that can har the vast influenc of the more than on hundr democrat nation around the world to advanc our valu and defend our share interest __PUNCT__
at the heart of thi new compact must be mutual respect and trust __PUNCT__
recal the word of our founder in the declar of independ __PUNCT__ that we pai __PUNCT__ decent respect to the opinion of mankind __PUNCT__
our great power doe not mean we can do whatev we want whenev we want __PUNCT__ nor should we assum we have all the wisdom and knowledg necessari to succe __PUNCT__
we need to listen to the view and respect the collect will of our democrat alli __PUNCT__
when we believ intern action is necessari __PUNCT__ whether militari __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ or diplomat __PUNCT__ we will try to persuad our friend that we ar right __PUNCT__
but we __PUNCT__ in return __PUNCT__ must be will to be persuad by them __PUNCT__
america must be a model citizen if we want other to look to us as a model __PUNCT__
how we behav at home affect how we ar perceiv abroad __PUNCT__
we must fight the terrorist and at the same time defend the right that ar the foundat of our societi __PUNCT__
we can't tortur or treat inhuman suspect terrorist we have captur __PUNCT__
i believ we should close guantanamo and work with our alli to forg a new intern understand on the disposit of danger detaine under our control __PUNCT__
there is such a thing as intern good citizenship __PUNCT__
we need to be good steward of our planet and join with other nation to help preserv our common home __PUNCT__
the risk of global warm have no border __PUNCT__
we and the other nation of the world must get seriou about substanti reduc greenhous ga emiss in the come year or we will hand off a much __PUNCT__ diminish world to our grandchildren __PUNCT__
we need a successor to the kyoto treati __PUNCT__ a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system that deliv the necessari environment impact in an econom respons manner __PUNCT__
we american must lead by exampl and encourag the particip of the rest of the world __PUNCT__ includ most importantli __PUNCT__ the develop econom powerhous of china and india __PUNCT__
four and a half decad ago __PUNCT__ john kennedi describ the peopl of latin america as our __PUNCT__ firm and ancient friend __PUNCT__ unit by histori and experi and by our determin to advanc the valu of american civil __PUNCT__
with global __PUNCT__ our hemispher ha grown closer __PUNCT__ more integr __PUNCT__ and more interdepend __PUNCT__
latin america todai is increasingli vital to the fortun of the unit state __PUNCT__
american north and south share a common geographi and a common destini __PUNCT__
the countri of latin america ar the natur partner of the unit state __PUNCT__ and our northern neighbor canada __PUNCT__
relat with our southern neighbor must be govern by mutual respect __PUNCT__ not by an imperi impuls or by anti __PUNCT__ american demagogueri __PUNCT__
the promis of north __PUNCT__ central __PUNCT__ and south american life is too great for that __PUNCT__
i believ the america can and must be the model for a new __NUM__ centuri relationship between north and south __PUNCT__
our can be the first complet democrat hemispher __PUNCT__ where trade is free across all border __PUNCT__ where the rule of law and the power of free market advanc the secur and prosper of all __PUNCT__
power in the world todai is move east __PUNCT__ the asia __PUNCT__ pacif region is on the rise __PUNCT__
togeth with our democrat partner of mani decad __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ we can grasp the opportun present in the unfold world and thi centuri can becom safe __PUNCT__ both american and asian __PUNCT__ both prosper and free __PUNCT__
asia ha made enorm stride in recent decad __PUNCT__
it econom achiev ar well known __PUNCT__ less known is that more peopl live under democrat rule in asia than in ani other region of the world __PUNCT__
deal with a rise china will be a central challeng for the next american presid __PUNCT__
recent prosper in china ha brought more peopl out of poverti faster than dure ani other time in human histori __PUNCT__
china newfound power impli respons __PUNCT__
china could bolster it claim that it is __PUNCT__ peacefulli rise __PUNCT__ by be more transpar about it signific militari buildup __PUNCT__ by work with the world to isol pariah state such as burma __PUNCT__ sudan and zimbabw __PUNCT__ and by ceas it effort to establish region forum and econom arrang design to exclud america from asia __PUNCT__
china and the unit state ar not destin to be adversari __PUNCT__
we have numer overlap interest and hope to see our relationship evolv in a manner that benefit both countri and __PUNCT__ in turn __PUNCT__ the asia __PUNCT__ pacif region and the world __PUNCT__
but until china move toward polit liber __PUNCT__ our relationship will be base on period share interest rather than the bedrock of share valu __PUNCT__
the unit state did not singl __PUNCT__ handedli win the cold war __PUNCT__ the transatlant allianc did __PUNCT__ in concert with partner around the world __PUNCT__
the bond we share with europ in term of histori __PUNCT__ valu __PUNCT__ and interest ar uniqu __PUNCT__
american should welcom the rise of a strong __PUNCT__ confid european union as we continu to support a strong nato __PUNCT__
the futur of the transatlant relationship li in confront the challeng of the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri worldwid __PUNCT__ develop a common energi polici __PUNCT__ creat a transatlant common market ty our economi more close togeth __PUNCT__ address the danger pose by a revanchist russia __PUNCT__ and institution our cooper on issu such as climat chang __PUNCT__ foreign assist __PUNCT__ and democraci promot __PUNCT__
we should start by ensur that the g __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the group of eight highli industri state __PUNCT__ becom again a club of lead market democraci __PUNCT__ it should includ brazil and india but exclud russia __PUNCT__
rather than toler russia nuclear blackmail or cyber attack __PUNCT__ western nation should make clear that the solidar of nato __PUNCT__ from the baltic to the black sea __PUNCT__ is indivis and that the organ door remain open to all democraci commit to the defens of freedom __PUNCT__
while africa problem __PUNCT__ poverti __PUNCT__ corrupt __PUNCT__ diseas __PUNCT__ and instabl __PUNCT__ ar well known __PUNCT__ we must refocu on the bright promis offer by mani countri on that contin __PUNCT__
we must strongli engag on a polit __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ and secur level with friendli govern across africa __PUNCT__ but insist on improv in transpar and the rule of law __PUNCT__
mani african nation will not reach their true potenti without extern assist to combat entrench problem __PUNCT__ such as hiv/aid __PUNCT__ that afflict african disproportion __PUNCT__
i will establish the goal of erad malaria on the contin __PUNCT__ the number on killer of african children under the ag of five __PUNCT__
in addit to save million of live in the world poorest region __PUNCT__ such a campaign would do much to add luster to america imag in the world __PUNCT__
we also share an oblig with the world other great power to halt and revers the prolifer of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the unit state and the intern commun must work togeth and do all in our power to contain and revers north korea nuclear weapon program and to prevent iran __PUNCT__ a nation whose presid ha repeatedli express a desir to wipe israel from the face of the earth __PUNCT__ from obtain a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we should work to reduc nuclear arsen all around the world __PUNCT__ start with our own __PUNCT__
forti year ago __PUNCT__ the five declar nuclear power came togeth in support of the nuclear nonprolifer treati and pledg to end the arm race and move toward nuclear disarma __PUNCT__
the time ha come to renew that commit __PUNCT__
we do not need all the weapon current in our arsen __PUNCT__
the unit state should lead a global effort at nuclear disarma consist with our vital interest and the caus of peac __PUNCT__
if we ar success in pull togeth a global coalit for peac and freedom __PUNCT__ if we lead by shoulder our intern respons and point the wai to a better and safer futur for human __PUNCT__ i believ we will gain tangibl benefit as a nation __PUNCT__
it will strengthen us to confront the transcend challeng of our time __PUNCT__ the threat of radic islam terror __PUNCT__
thi challeng is transcend not becaus it is the onli on we face __PUNCT__
there ar mani danger in todai world __PUNCT__ and our foreign polici must be agil and effect at deal with all of them __PUNCT__
but the threat pose by the terrorist is uniqu __PUNCT__
thei alon devot all their energi and inde their veri live to murder innoc men __PUNCT__ women __PUNCT__ and children __PUNCT__
thei alon seek nuclear weapon and other tool of mass destruct not to defend themselv or to enhanc their prestig or to give them a stronger hand in world affair but to us against us wherev and whenev thei can __PUNCT__
ani presid who doe not regard thi threat as transcend all other doe not deserv to sit in the white hous __PUNCT__ for he or she doe not take serious enough the first and most basic duti a presid ha __PUNCT__ to protect the live of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we learn through the tragic experi of __DATE__ that passiv defens alon cannot protect us __PUNCT__
we must protect our border __PUNCT__
but we must also have an aggress strategi of confront and root out the terrorist wherev thei seek to oper __PUNCT__ and deni them base in fail or fail state __PUNCT__
todai al qaeda and other terrorist network oper across the globe __PUNCT__ seek out opportun in southeast asia __PUNCT__ central asia __PUNCT__ africa __PUNCT__ and in the middl east __PUNCT__
prevail in thi struggl will requir far more than militari forc __PUNCT__
it will requir the us of all element of our nation power __PUNCT__ public diplomaci __PUNCT__ develop assist __PUNCT__ law enforc train __PUNCT__ expans of econom opportun __PUNCT__ and robust intellig capabl __PUNCT__
i have call for major chang in how our govern face the challeng of radic islam extrem by much greater resourc for and integr of civilian effort to prevent conflict and to address post __PUNCT__ conflict challeng __PUNCT__
our goal must be to win the __PUNCT__ heart and mind __PUNCT__ of the vast major of moder muslim who do not want their futur control by a minor of violent extremist __PUNCT__
in thi struggl __PUNCT__ scholarship will be far more import than smart bomb __PUNCT__
we also need to build the intern structur for a durabl peac in which the radic extremist ar gradual eclips by the more power forc of freedom and toler __PUNCT__
our effort in iraq and afghanistan ar critic in thi respect and cannot be view in isol from our broader strategi __PUNCT__
in the troubl and often danger region thei occupi __PUNCT__ these two nation can either be sourc of extrem and instabl or thei can in time becom pillar of stabil __PUNCT__ toler __PUNCT__ and democraci __PUNCT__
for decad in the greater middl east __PUNCT__ we had a strategi of reli on autocrat to provid order and stabil __PUNCT__
we reli on the shah of iran __PUNCT__ the autocrat ruler of egypt __PUNCT__ the gener of pakistan __PUNCT__ the saudi royal famili __PUNCT__ and even __PUNCT__ for a time __PUNCT__ on saddam hussein __PUNCT__
in the late 1970 that strategi began to unravel __PUNCT__
the shah wa overthrown by the radic islam revolut that now rule in tehran __PUNCT__
the ensu ferment in the muslim world produc increas instabl __PUNCT__
the autocrat clamp down with ever greater repress __PUNCT__ while also surreptiti aid islam radic abroad in the hope that thei would not becom it victim __PUNCT__
it wa a toxic and explos mixtur __PUNCT__
the oppress of the autocrat blend with the radic islamist __PUNCT__ dogmat theologi to produc a perfect storm of intoler and hatr __PUNCT__
we can no longer delud ourselv that reli on these out __PUNCT__ date autocraci is the safest bet __PUNCT__
thei no longer provid last stabil __PUNCT__ onli the illus of it __PUNCT__
we must not act rashli or demand chang overnight __PUNCT__
but neither can we pretend the statu quo is sustain __PUNCT__ stabl __PUNCT__ or in our interest __PUNCT__
chang is occur whether we want it or not __PUNCT__
the onli question for us is whether we shape thi chang in wai that benefit human or let our enemi seiz it for their hate purpos __PUNCT__
we must help expand the power and reach of freedom __PUNCT__ us all our mani strength as a free peopl __PUNCT__
thi is not just ideal __PUNCT__
it is the truest kind of realism __PUNCT__
it is the democraci of the world that will provid the pillar upon which we can and must build an endur peac __PUNCT__
if you look at the great arc that extend from the middl east through central asia and the asian subcontin all the wai to southeast asia __PUNCT__ you can see those pillar of democraci stretch across the entir expans __PUNCT__ from turkei and israel to india and indonesia __PUNCT__
iraq and afghanistan lie at the heart of that region __PUNCT__
and whether thei eventu becom stabl democraci themselv __PUNCT__ or ar allow to sink back into chao and extrem __PUNCT__ will determin not onli the fate of that critic part of the world __PUNCT__ but our fate __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
that is the broad strateg perspect through which to view our effort in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
mani peopl ask __PUNCT__ how should we defin success __PUNCT__ success in iraq and afghanistan is the establish of peac __PUNCT__ stabl __PUNCT__ prosper __PUNCT__ democrat state that pose no threat to neighbor and contribut to the defeat of terrorist __PUNCT__
it is the triumph of religi toler over violent radic __PUNCT__
those who argu that our goal in iraq ar unachiev ar wrong __PUNCT__ just as thei were wrong a year ago when thei declar the war in iraq alreadi lost __PUNCT__
sinc __DATE__ sectarian and ethnic violenc in iraq ha been reduc by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
overal civilian death have been reduc by more than __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
death of coalit forc have fallen by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the dramat reduct in violenc ha open the wai for a return to someth approach normal polit and econom life for the averag iraqi __PUNCT__
peopl ar go back to work __PUNCT__
market ar open __PUNCT__
oil revenu ar climb __PUNCT__
inflat is down __PUNCT__
iraq economi is expect to grown by roughli __NUM__ percent in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
polit reconcili is occur across iraq at the local and provinci grassroot level __PUNCT__
sunni and shi'a chase from their home by terrorist and sectarian violenc ar return __PUNCT__
polit progress at the nation level ha been far too slow __PUNCT__ but there is progress __PUNCT__
critic sai that the __PUNCT__ surg __PUNCT__ of troop isn't a solut in itself __PUNCT__ that we must make progress toward iraqi self __PUNCT__ suffici __PUNCT__
i agre __PUNCT__
iraqi themselv must increasingli take respons for their own secur __PUNCT__ and thei must becom respons polit actor __PUNCT__
it doe not follow from thi __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ that we should now recklessli retreat from iraq regardless of the consequ __PUNCT__
we must take the cours of prudenc and respons __PUNCT__ and help iraqi move closer to the dai when thei no longer need our help __PUNCT__
that is the rout of respons statesmanship __PUNCT__
we have incur a moral respons in iraq __PUNCT__
it would be an unconscion act of betray __PUNCT__ a stain on our charact as a great nation __PUNCT__ if we were to walk awai from the iraqi peopl and consign them to the horrend violenc __PUNCT__ ethnic cleans __PUNCT__ and possibl genocid that would follow a reckless __PUNCT__ irrespons __PUNCT__ and prematur withdraw __PUNCT__
our critic sai america need to repair it imag in the world __PUNCT__
how can thei argu at the same time for the moral reprehens abandon of our respons in iraq __PUNCT__ those who claim we should withdraw from iraq in order to fight al qaeda more effect elsewher ar make a danger mistak __PUNCT__
whether thei were there befor is immateri __PUNCT__ al qaeda is in iraq now __PUNCT__ as it is in the borderland between pakistan and afghanistan __PUNCT__ in somalia __PUNCT__ and in indonesia __PUNCT__
if we withdraw prematur from iraq __PUNCT__ al qaeda in iraq will surviv __PUNCT__ proclaim victori and continu to provok sectarian tension that __PUNCT__ while thei have been subdu by the success of the surg __PUNCT__ still exist __PUNCT__ as variou faction of sunni and shi'a have yet to move beyond their ancient hatr __PUNCT__ and ar ripe for provoc by al qaeda __PUNCT__
civil war in iraq could easili descend into genocid __PUNCT__ and destabil the entir region as neighbor power come to the aid of their favor faction __PUNCT__
i believ a reckless and prematur withdraw would be a terribl defeat for our secur interest and our valu __PUNCT__
iran will also view our prematur withdraw as a victori __PUNCT__ and the biggest state support of terrorist __PUNCT__ a countri with nuclear ambit and a state desir to destroi the state of israel __PUNCT__ will see it influenc in the middl east grow significantli __PUNCT__
these consequ of our defeat would threaten us for year __PUNCT__ and those who argu for it __PUNCT__ as both democrat candid do __PUNCT__ ar argu for a cours that would eventu draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would entail far greater danger and sacrific than we have suffer to date __PUNCT__
i do not argu against withdraw __PUNCT__ ani more than i argu sever year ago for the chang in tactic and addit forc that ar now succeed in iraq __PUNCT__ becaus i am somehow indiffer to war and the suffer it inflict on too mani american famili __PUNCT__
i hold my posit becaus i hate war __PUNCT__ and i know veri well and veri person how grievou it wage ar __PUNCT__
but i know __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ that we must sometim pai those wage to avoid pai even higher on later __PUNCT__
i run for presid becaus i want to keep the countri i love and have serv all my life safe __PUNCT__ and to rise to the challeng of our time __PUNCT__ as gener befor us rose to their __PUNCT__
i run for presid becaus i know it is incumb on america __PUNCT__ more than ani other nation on earth __PUNCT__ to lead in build the foundat for a stabl and endur peac __PUNCT__ a peac built on the strength of our commit to it __PUNCT__ on the transform ideal on which we were found __PUNCT__ on our abil to see around the corner of histori __PUNCT__ and on our courag and wisdom to make hard choic __PUNCT__
i run becaus i believ __PUNCT__ as strongli as i ever have __PUNCT__ that it is within our power to make in our time anoth __PUNCT__ better world than we inherit __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
