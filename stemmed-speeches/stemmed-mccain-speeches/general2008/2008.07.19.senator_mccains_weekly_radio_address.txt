good morn __PUNCT__
i john mccain __PUNCT__ and thi week __PUNCT__ debat in the presidenti campaign turn to the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ announc hi strategi for afghanistan and iraq befor depart on a fact __PUNCT__ find mission that will includ visit to both those countri __PUNCT__
appar __PUNCT__ he confid enough that he won't find ani fact that might chang hi opinion or alter hi strategi __PUNCT__
remark __PUNCT__
thi is similar to the mistak senat obama made when he confid declar that the surg in iraq could not possibl reduc sectarian violenc there __PUNCT__ and might well increas violenc __PUNCT__
he wa so certain the surg would fail that he call for our troop to retreat as quickli as possibl __PUNCT__
senat obama previou statement against the surg have been hastili remov from hi campaign websit __PUNCT__ in the audaci hope that no on would notic __PUNCT__
but we all rememb quit well that he said the surg would fail __PUNCT__ and todai we know that he wa wrong __PUNCT__
although the situat in iraq is much improv __PUNCT__ the war in afghanistan ha taken a bad turn that must be quickli revers __PUNCT__
secur in that countri ha deterior __PUNCT__ and our enemi ar on the offens __PUNCT__
and it is precis the success of the surg in iraq that show us the wai to victori over the taliban __PUNCT__
our command on the ground in afghanistan sai thei need at least three addit brigad __PUNCT__
i will ensur our command in afghanistan get the troop thei need by ask nato to send more and by send u. __PUNCT__ troop as thei becom avail __PUNCT__
but send more forc __PUNCT__ by itself __PUNCT__ is not enough to prevail __PUNCT__
what we need in afghanistan is exactli what gener david petraeu brought to iraq __PUNCT__ a nationwid civil __PUNCT__ militari campaign plan that is focus on provid secur for the popul __PUNCT__
todai no such integr plan exist __PUNCT__
when i am command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ it will __PUNCT__
there ar mani differ between afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__ which ani plan must account for __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ as in iraq __PUNCT__ the center of graviti is the secur of the popul __PUNCT__
the good new is that our soldier in afghanistan have begun to appli the lesson of iraq __PUNCT__ especi in the east __PUNCT__ where our forc ar concentr __PUNCT__
these effort __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ ar too piecem __PUNCT__
thei ar the work of innov local command __PUNCT__ rather than a strategi for the entir countri __PUNCT__
in particular __PUNCT__ american forc must re __PUNCT__ engag deeper in southern afghanistan __PUNCT__ the taliban stronghold __PUNCT__
a cardin rule in ani militari oper is uniti of command __PUNCT__ and thi ha been lack in our afghan campaign __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar three differ american militari combat command oper in afghanistan __PUNCT__ as well as nato __PUNCT__
and some of their member oper under nation restrict as to where their troop can go and what thei can do __PUNCT__
thi is not a smart militari practic __PUNCT__ and it is not how war ar won __PUNCT__
as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ i will work with our alli to ensur uniti of command __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ with help from other nation __PUNCT__ we must doubl the size of afghanistan own fight forc to __NUM__ troop __PUNCT__ so that battl __PUNCT__ test afghan soldier can safeguard their own peopl __PUNCT__
a success counterinsurg requir all instrument of our nation power __PUNCT__ and that militari and civilian leader work togeth __PUNCT__ at all level __PUNCT__ under a joint plan __PUNCT__
too often in afghanistan thi is not happen __PUNCT__
so i will appoint a highli __PUNCT__ respect nation secur leader __PUNCT__ base in the white hous and report directli to the presid __PUNCT__ whose sole mission will be to assur victori in afghanistan __PUNCT__
a special focu of our region strategi must be pakistan __PUNCT__ where terrorist ar known to hide __PUNCT__
on wai to root them out is to strengthen local tribe in the border area that ar will to fight them __PUNCT__
senat obama ha spoken in public about take unilater militari action in pakistan __PUNCT__
but in try to sound tough __PUNCT__ he ha onli made it harder to enlist the full support of pakistan in the fight against terrorist __PUNCT__
in a time of war __PUNCT__ the command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief job doesn't get a learn curv __PUNCT__
and if i have that privileg __PUNCT__ i will bring to the job mani year of militari and polit experi __PUNCT__
it wa thi experi that guid me in the convict that the surg in iraq could turn thing around __PUNCT__ and clear a path to victori __PUNCT__
and i believ with equal convict that we can prevail in afghanistan __PUNCT__ assur freedom to the afghan peopl and greater secur to the american peopl __PUNCT__
thank for listen __PUNCT__
