thank you all for join us __PUNCT__
for week now __PUNCT__ the attent of our countri ha been focus on the seriou financi troubl we face __PUNCT__
at such a time __PUNCT__ when the job and financi secur of our peopl seem at risk __PUNCT__ it is hard to spare much thought even for the great and abid concern of thi nation secur __PUNCT__ and the secur of our friend and alli across the world __PUNCT__
but these danger have not gone awai while we turn our attent elsewher __PUNCT__
and the next presid will meet no greater test than defend america from these threat __PUNCT__
my fellow american __PUNCT__ we go to get through thi econom crisi __PUNCT__
and we will even come out stronger __PUNCT__ without the corrupt and arrog that have overtaken both washington and wall street __PUNCT__
we go to pull through these hard time __PUNCT__ and do it togeth __PUNCT__ just as our countri ha done befor __PUNCT__
but when that dai arriv __PUNCT__ and the worri of financi crisi have fallen awai __PUNCT__ we will find await our countri all of the same great challeng and danger that were there all along __PUNCT__
thei matter befor the econom turmoil of the present __PUNCT__
thei will matter still when it ha pass __PUNCT__
and in a time of war __PUNCT__ at a moment of danger for our countri and the world __PUNCT__
let it not be said of us that we lost sight of these challeng __PUNCT__
todai i consult with a number of distinguish citizen who know __PUNCT__ from experi __PUNCT__ what matter most in the affair of our countri __PUNCT__
thei understand that no respons of govern is more fundament than protect thi countri from the threat of the world __PUNCT__
thei ar trust friend and advisor of long stand __PUNCT__ includ dr __PUNCT__ henri kissing __PUNCT__ a man whose diplomat experi includ help to secur the releas of me and my fellow pow from hanoi __PUNCT__
by phone __PUNCT__ i confer as well with former secretari of state shultz and eagleburg __PUNCT__
these gentlemen ar alwai good for sound advic __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i would be reli on men and women of their calib and experi __PUNCT__
these statesmen and those who have join me here todai ar support my candidaci becaus we share mani of the same convict __PUNCT__ and the same assess of the nation secur challeng befor our countri __PUNCT__
and with good reason __PUNCT__ thei question whether my oppon in thi elect ha the wisdom or judgment to serv as command in chief __PUNCT__
victori must still be secur __PUNCT__ in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
senat obama oppos remov the dictat in iraq __PUNCT__ and now obstin oppos the need to defend the young democraci in that countri __PUNCT__ even with victori so clearli in sight __PUNCT__
he cite as hi most courag moment in public life a speech he gave in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ against a war resolut on which he had no vote __PUNCT__ on a matter of nation secur for which he bore no respons __PUNCT__
he hope you will forget the vote he cast when he actual did have respons __PUNCT__
hi vote to prevent the strategi that is lead to victori __PUNCT__ and to deni fund for the troop who ar gain that victori __PUNCT__
and now he hope that in the cloud of crisi at home you will forget the stake in iraq __PUNCT__ the disast and tragedi that would follow if american forc leav in retreat __PUNCT__
with terrorist still plot new strike across the world __PUNCT__ million of innoc live ar still at stake __PUNCT__ includ american live __PUNCT__
our enemi __PUNCT__ violent ambit must still be prevent __PUNCT__ by american vigil __PUNCT__ by diplomaci and cooper with our partner __PUNCT__ and by forc of arm as a last resort __PUNCT__
in hi four year in the senat __PUNCT__ two of them spent run for presid __PUNCT__ barack obama ha displai some impress qualiti __PUNCT__
but the question is whether thi is a man who ha what it take to protect america from osama bin laden __PUNCT__ al qaeda __PUNCT__ and other grave threat in the world __PUNCT__
and he ha given you no reason to answer in the affirm __PUNCT__
senat joe biden ha a wai of strai off messag and stumbl on the truth __PUNCT__ and hi most recent warn bear close attent __PUNCT__
he caution us __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ he guarante hi listen __PUNCT__ that becaus he is untest barack obama would onli invit an intern crisi __PUNCT__
and we know well what on of those crise could be __PUNCT__ the success of the iranian regim in it program of acquir nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
if such a thing were to happen __PUNCT__ our troubl of todai would dramat escal __PUNCT__ as a nuclear __PUNCT__ arm iran threaten israel or spark an uncontrol nuclear arm race across the region __PUNCT__
in the same wai __PUNCT__ my oppon assum far more good will than is warrant from kim jong il __PUNCT__ the tyrant of north korea __PUNCT__
hugo chavez __PUNCT__ the leader of venezuela who wish to export instabl to neighbor countri __PUNCT__ and the castro brother __PUNCT__ who have given cuba fifti year __PUNCT__ worth of socialist miseri and ar still at it __PUNCT__
in each case __PUNCT__ senat obama present hi plan for direct talk as if no on befor had ever consid that __PUNCT__
he seem unawar that mere talk ha been tri mani time __PUNCT__ to no avail and that our adversari recogn such gestur as a sign of weak __PUNCT__
thei will draw similar assumpt from the plan __PUNCT__ alreadi propos by the chairman of the hous financ committe __PUNCT__ congressman barnei frank __PUNCT__ to cut defens spend by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
even with our troop engag in two war __PUNCT__ and with a forc in need of rebuild __PUNCT__ we get a glimps of what on __PUNCT__ parti rule would look like under obama __PUNCT__ pelosi __PUNCT__ and reid __PUNCT__
appar it start with lower our defens and rais our tax __PUNCT__
our nation secur is depend on our econom secur __PUNCT__ and the plan of a democrat domin washington would harm both __PUNCT__
rais tax and unilater renegoti trade agreement as thei have promis would make a bad economi even wors __PUNCT__ and undermin our nation secur __PUNCT__ even as thei slash defens spend __PUNCT__
at least when european nation chose the path of higher tax and cut defens __PUNCT__ thei knew that their secur would still be guarante by america __PUNCT__
but if america take the same path __PUNCT__ who will guarante our secur __PUNCT__ in an unusu refrain for a close argument __PUNCT__ senat obama ha late taken to tell america that on mani great issu __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ we don't have to choos __PUNCT__
it is a fit motto for a man who throughout hi career ha so often vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__ instead of give a simpl __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
but ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ there is a time for choos __PUNCT__
it is six dai awai __PUNCT__
america ha a decis to make __PUNCT__ on these fate question and more __PUNCT__
and when you cast your vote __PUNCT__ my fellow citizen __PUNCT__ let there be no confus about the threat we face and the cost of fail to meet them __PUNCT__
i had to make a few defin choic of my own along the wai __PUNCT__
on of them came last year __PUNCT__ when i told you that i would rather lose an elect than see my countri lose a war __PUNCT__
i chose that cours becaus i know the qualiti of those who fight our war __PUNCT__ but also becaus i know the charact of the american peopl __PUNCT__
i believ that you __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ would persever in support of our most fundament interest in the world __PUNCT__ and you did __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__
you gave our troop time to complet their mission __PUNCT__ and thei almost have __PUNCT__
and at a crucial hour in a vital caus __PUNCT__ that ha made all the differ __PUNCT__
becaus of that support __PUNCT__ our troop will soon come home in victori __PUNCT__
we have pass through a difficult time __PUNCT__ and more courag will be need in the year ahead __PUNCT__
but there is a direct to event __PUNCT__ and the sacrific of the present have not been in vain __PUNCT__
we will build on our hard __PUNCT__ won victori to extend the secur of our nation and of everi nation that seek to live in freedom __PUNCT__
we will not yield to intimid __PUNCT__ and by our strength we will prevent threat from turn into tragedi __PUNCT__
thi is america work in the world __PUNCT__ as it ha alwai been in our finest moment __PUNCT__
we ar call still to spread liberti __PUNCT__ to assur justic __PUNCT__ to be the maker of peac __PUNCT__
and thi is the great work i will carri on as your presid and command in chief __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
