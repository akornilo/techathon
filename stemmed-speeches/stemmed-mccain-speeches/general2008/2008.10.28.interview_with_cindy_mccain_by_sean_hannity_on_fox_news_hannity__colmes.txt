mccain __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ their ad __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ i want to get to that becaus __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ senat obama said it a tragedi __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ that redistribut of wealth wasn't pursu by the suprem court __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ that what scari __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl believ that there go to be three vacanc on the unit state suprem court __PUNCT__ and some of the thought and write and statement by senat obama about how it the job of the __PUNCT__ of the judiciari to be __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ redistribut __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ let fast __PUNCT__ forward up to just a short time ago __PUNCT__
senat obama oppos justic robert and alito __PUNCT__ and he said on ideolog ground __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ sean __PUNCT__ true confess __PUNCT__
i vote for justic brier and ginsburg __PUNCT__ not becaus i agre with their philosophi __PUNCT__ but becaus thei were qualifi to serv __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ even though you had __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ even though i had strong disagr with their ideolog __PUNCT__
now senat obama want to filibust the __PUNCT__ robert and alito and oppos them becaus we __PUNCT__ becaus of their __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ conserv view __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ ar thei qualifi __PUNCT__ of cours robert and alito ar __PUNCT__
and so i think __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ thi is realli reveal to american who understand the import of suprem court justic __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ it obvious a big issu in the campaign __PUNCT__ and there mai be two or __PUNCT__ as you point out __PUNCT__ as mani as three vacanc on the court __PUNCT__
i want __PUNCT__ let me ask you a coupl of simpl question about thi redistribut of wealth for senat redistribut __PUNCT__
is it social __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ certainli it part of the socialist creed __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ philosophi __PUNCT__
it to share the wealth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if senat obama a __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ socialist __PUNCT__ or not is someth that i let those theoretician decid __PUNCT__

hanniti __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ with sarah __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ we interview her last night __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ when she __PUNCT__ isn't she marvel __PUNCT__ hanniti __PUNCT__ i work with her friend __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and a great __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ she did a great job __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ she a __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ person __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ she __PUNCT__ i thought alan wa tough __PUNCT__
she got it realli veri tough __PUNCT__
she got __PUNCT__ you know joi recent call me danger __PUNCT__
so you know __PUNCT__ i get a littl heat __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
i be neglig if i wouldn't talk about senat biden comment that senat obama would be test in the first six month __PUNCT__ that there will be __PUNCT__ mark my word __PUNCT__ an intern crisi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there been a lot of issu involv nation secur __PUNCT__
i don't know if you heard thi __PUNCT__ but french presid sarkozi todai us the term talk about senat obama plan on iran is basic naiv and utterli immatur wa the phrase he us __PUNCT__
that meet with roug dictat __PUNCT__ iran a tini countri __PUNCT__ not a seriou threat __PUNCT__
put all that togeth __PUNCT__ should america be concern about hi abil to be command in chief __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think thei should be concern __PUNCT__ and i think thei should __PUNCT__ and thei make a decis __PUNCT__ but the point is that he been wrong __PUNCT__ he wa wrong about the surg __PUNCT__ still won't admit that he wa wrong __PUNCT__
he wrong about when he said that iran is a tini threat __PUNCT__ he wa wrong when he said that georgia should exercis restraint __PUNCT__
but the point is that senat obama ha no experi and no background to make the judgment __PUNCT__ and i wish that everi american could hear the tape of what __PUNCT__ the wai that senat biden said that __PUNCT__
he said mark my word __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ i had to plai it __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ there be an intern crisi __PUNCT__
sean __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ becaus he untest __PUNCT__ and he will have to be test __PUNCT__
the on thing about these peopl that we up against __PUNCT__ i been test __PUNCT__ and thei know it __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ doe that telegraph to the world __PUNCT__ i mean dure the debat __PUNCT__ the issu that he vote to cut off fund for the troop dure the war __PUNCT__ that he __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ after pledg that he wouldn't __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ he accus the troop of air __PUNCT__ raid villag and kill civilian __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ he said he pull out __PUNCT__ i end thi war in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
he sinc adjust that __PUNCT__
what doe that mean __PUNCT__ doe that mean we lose the war __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when harri reid announc that he agre with him __PUNCT__ and there no doubt that if we would done what senat obama want to do __PUNCT__ we have come home __PUNCT__
our troop would have come home __PUNCT__ there would have been more sectarian violenc in al qaeda beachhead __PUNCT__ greater iranian influenc in the region __PUNCT__ and we probabl have to have gone back and __PUNCT__ with further sacrific __PUNCT__
but i think the other point here is that senat obama just __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ when i hear him sai some of these thing __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ about colombia __PUNCT__ that the reason why he wa against a free trade agreement with our best friend in the whole hemispher is becaus that labor leader ar be kill __PUNCT__ that an old saw that the union leader drag out year ago __PUNCT__
there ha been dramat improv in colombia __PUNCT__
colombia is help us fight thi struggl against __PUNCT__ the presid of colombia rescu three american who were be held captiv by the farc that ar work with the peopl he would sit down with __PUNCT__ hugo chavez __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ it just __PUNCT__ he doe not have the experi to make the right judgment __PUNCT__
hanniti __PUNCT__ last question __PUNCT__
senat obama seem to be prepar hi victori speech __PUNCT__ he sai __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the righteou win is at our back __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ million parti in grand park __PUNCT__
we got all the acorn controversi __PUNCT__
do you think he coast to victori __PUNCT__ is he pick out the drape a littl earli __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i think that more than on candid ha read the poll at the time and not the trend __PUNCT__ and i guarante you on thing __PUNCT__
