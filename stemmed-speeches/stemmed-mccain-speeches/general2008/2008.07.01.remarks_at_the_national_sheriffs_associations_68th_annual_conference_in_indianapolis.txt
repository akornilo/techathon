at the feder level __PUNCT__ presid reagan offer a differ approach to crimin justic __PUNCT__ focus on vigor enforc and stricter sentenc __PUNCT__
crimin justic reform is a part of the reagan revolut that is often forgotten todai __PUNCT__
but over time __PUNCT__ america becam a better __PUNCT__ safer __PUNCT__ and more just countri becaus of those reform __PUNCT__
and you the on who help to make it happen __PUNCT__
we still hear some academ and politician speak as if a rise rate of incarcer and a reduct in crime were unrel fact __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ when the most violent and persist crimin ar in prison __PUNCT__ crime rate will go down __PUNCT__
and thi is exactli what happen through the __NUM__ and most of thi decad __PUNCT__
the progress our countri made against crime wa the result of smart polici __PUNCT__ bipartisan cooper __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ abov all __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ qualiti work by the men and women of law enforc __PUNCT__
mani of our citi becam safer dure the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thank to the resolut action of citi and counti leader such as my friend rudi giuliani and hi polic commission bill bratton __PUNCT__
dure both republican and democrat administr __PUNCT__ congress continu to suppli state and local with new resourc __PUNCT__
under legisl i support __PUNCT__ we have also sought to increas penalti for repeat felon who commit crime with a firearm __PUNCT__ or commit violent crime on behalf of a crimin gang __PUNCT__
we have work to improv the nation instant crimin background check system for firearm purchas __PUNCT__
and we have sought to increas the fine crimin must pai into the feder crime victim fund and bar all crimin from profit from their crime __PUNCT__
we also expand public registri requir for convict sex offend __PUNCT__ becaus to prevent and punish the exploit of children __PUNCT__ the surest polici is zero __PUNCT__ toler __PUNCT__
when anyon is convict of a sexual assault on a child __PUNCT__ thei should stai in prison for a long time __PUNCT__ and their name should stai forev on the nation sex offend public registri __PUNCT__
when thei ar releas __PUNCT__ if thei ar releas __PUNCT__ thei should be track both in their physic movement and in their internet usag __PUNCT__
and under a bill i have author as a senat __PUNCT__ and intend to sign into law as presid __PUNCT__ we go to get seriou against internet predat __PUNCT__ anyon who us the internet in the commiss of a crime of child exploit is go offlin and into prison for an addit ten year __PUNCT__
in protect children and in all crimin justic polici __PUNCT__ at both the state and feder level __PUNCT__ we have shown how much can be achiev when consist principl ar appli and both parti work togeth __PUNCT__
and thi spirit will be need in meet the challeng of our own time __PUNCT__
the overal trend in crime ar small comfort to the more than six million victim of violent crime in america each year __PUNCT__ or to the more than __NUM__ million victim of properti crime __PUNCT__
in an enterpris measur by the standard of __NUM__ percent success __PUNCT__ there is no time to linger on the progress of the past __PUNCT__
we need to stai on the offens against crime __PUNCT__ and especi crime of violenc __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha it own well defin set of law __PUNCT__ enforc concern __PUNCT__ such as multi __PUNCT__ state crimin syndic __PUNCT__ terrorist cell __PUNCT__ govern corrupt __PUNCT__ and the protect of america border __PUNCT__
and from the standpoint of state and local law enforc __PUNCT__ often the best servic our feder govern can render is to do these thing and do them right __PUNCT__
presidenti leadership is essenti in all of these respons __PUNCT__
but nowher is the influenc of a presid more critic to law enforc than in the power of judici nomin __PUNCT__
it will fall to the next presid to nomin hundr of men and women to the feder court __PUNCT__
these choic will have far __PUNCT__ reach consequ for all american __PUNCT__ and perhap especi for law enforc __PUNCT__
when a seriou crime is investig __PUNCT__ prosecut __PUNCT__ and punish __PUNCT__ it take mani hour and the best effort of polic __PUNCT__ trial court __PUNCT__ and juri __PUNCT__
yet on badli reason opinion __PUNCT__ by on overreach judg __PUNCT__ can undo it all __PUNCT__
just like that __PUNCT__ evid of guilt can be suppress __PUNCT__ or a danger predat releas becaus of judg __PUNCT__ made law have littl or noth to do with the requir of the constitut __PUNCT__
even wors __PUNCT__ when such opinion issu from the highest court __PUNCT__ thei set a preced for mani more injustic __PUNCT__ and thei add on more obstacl to the work of law enforc __PUNCT__
we saw such presumpt again just last week in a matter befor the suprem court __PUNCT__
in the consid judgment of the peopl of louisiana and their elect repres __PUNCT__ the violent rape of a small child is a capit offens __PUNCT__
there is noth in our constitut to contradict that view __PUNCT__
but five justic decid the peopl judgment didn't take into account __PUNCT__ evolv standard of decenc __PUNCT__ and so thei substitut their judgment for that of the peopl of louisiana __PUNCT__ their legisl __PUNCT__ their governor __PUNCT__ the trial judg __PUNCT__ the juri __PUNCT__ the appel judg __PUNCT__ and the other four justic of the suprem court __PUNCT__
it a peculiar kind of moral evolut that disregard the democrat process __PUNCT__ and inur sole to the benefit of child rapist __PUNCT__
it wa such a jar decis from the court that my oppon __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ immedi and to hi credit express hi disagr __PUNCT__
i like to think thi signal a chang of heart on hi part about hi vote against the confirm of two of the four dissent in the case __PUNCT__ justic samuel alito and chief justic john robert __PUNCT__
more to the point __PUNCT__ why is it that the major includ the same justic he usual hold out as the model for futur nomin __PUNCT__ my oppon mai not care for thi particular decis __PUNCT__ but it wa exactli the kind of opinion we could expect from an obama court __PUNCT__
should i be elect presid __PUNCT__ i will look for accomplish men and women with a proven record of excel in the law __PUNCT__ and a proven commit to judici restraint __PUNCT__
thei will be the kind of judg who believ in give everyon in a crimin court their due __PUNCT__ justic for the guilti and the innoc __PUNCT__ compass for the victim __PUNCT__ and respect for the men and women of law enforc __PUNCT__
in all of crimin justic polici __PUNCT__ we must put the interest of law __PUNCT__ abid citizen first __PUNCT__ and abov all the right of victim __PUNCT__
and when we formul crimin justic polici __PUNCT__ word of prais for the good work of local law enforc ar not enough __PUNCT__
we must give activ support to offic of the peac across america __PUNCT__ by provid the tool you need to meet new danger __PUNCT__
even as crime ha diminish in some area __PUNCT__ includ new york and other major citi __PUNCT__ crime is spread in mani small and mid __PUNCT__ size jurisdict __PUNCT__
and the gener number in crime reduct conceal on of the most disturb fact of all __PUNCT__ the rise of new __PUNCT__ better organ __PUNCT__ and more wide dispers gang violenc and transnat gang __PUNCT__
onc larg confin to major citi __PUNCT__ the threat of gang violenc is now well known to sheriff and correct offic across america __PUNCT__
and in all case of violent crime __PUNCT__ in both urban and rural area __PUNCT__ it the poorest among us who ar most vulner __PUNCT__
to meet all of these challeng __PUNCT__ and other __PUNCT__ you will need assist __PUNCT__ critic resourc __PUNCT__ and new technolog that often onli the feder govern can provid __PUNCT__
and on of the most critic of these resourc concern the radio spectrum __PUNCT__
so that polic __PUNCT__ fire __PUNCT__ fighter __PUNCT__ and other public safeti agenc can freeli commun with on anoth __PUNCT__ we will build a long overdu nation __PUNCT__ interoper public safeti broadband network __PUNCT__
you and all your colleagu in law enforc need seamless commun across everi agenc and jurisdict for emerg respons __PUNCT__
for more than a decad now __PUNCT__ i have tri to persuad the congress to provid dedic radio spectrum and fund for commun equip to local __PUNCT__ state __PUNCT__ and feder law enforc offic __PUNCT__
just last year __PUNCT__ i introduc a bill that provid for more than twice the capac that the fcc ha current set asid for public safeti __PUNCT__
special interest in washington want the fcc to auction off more of that spectrum than i do __PUNCT__
but no matter what price it might fetch at auction __PUNCT__ it should be avail for fight crime and save live __PUNCT__
the congress __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ need to get it prioriti straight __PUNCT__ and that begin by support the prioriti of front __PUNCT__ line law __PUNCT__ enforc personnel __PUNCT__
as it is __PUNCT__ fund distribut by the depart of justic ar too often earmark accord to their valu to the re __PUNCT__ elect of member of congress instead of their valu to polic __PUNCT__
thi is especi true in the case of grant alloc under the byrn program __PUNCT__ mani of which ar urgent need to interdict drug and track the movement of violent gang __PUNCT__
the result is that million of dollar ar wast everi year __PUNCT__ and a lot of good idea and program in local law enforc never get fund __PUNCT__
earmark spend bill ar the broken window of the feder budget process __PUNCT__ and by end these abus we set a new tone and we set much greater reform in motion __PUNCT__
earmark spend run against the public interest in mani wai __PUNCT__ and especi when public safeti is in the balanc __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will veto everi bill with earmark __PUNCT__ until the congress stop send bill with earmark __PUNCT__
it mai take a while for congress to adjust __PUNCT__ but sooner or later thei figur out that there a new sheriff in town __PUNCT__
law enforc profession know best what thei need in the field __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ what often need most ar more personnel and better technolog for track crimin __PUNCT__ gather data __PUNCT__ and share vital inform __PUNCT__
we need to make certain that everi agenc is work with other where necessari __PUNCT__ so that the miscommun and miss opportun befor 9/11 ar never repeat __PUNCT__
to protect our energi suppli __PUNCT__ air and rail transport __PUNCT__ bank and financi servic __PUNCT__ we need to invest far more in the feder task of cyber secur __PUNCT__
in thi new centuri __PUNCT__ and especi with the threat of terrorist attack __PUNCT__ everi state __PUNCT__ local __PUNCT__ and feder agenc concern with public safeti should have access a share repositori of inform __PUNCT__
in the case of ani suspect terrorist __PUNCT__ we must make certain that law enforc know who thei ar __PUNCT__ where thei ar __PUNCT__ and what thei up to __PUNCT__
we know as well that ten of thousand of felon __PUNCT__ in custodi and at larg __PUNCT__ enter our countri illeg __PUNCT__
why ha it ha fallen to sheriff and other local offici to protect their citizen from these foreign __PUNCT__ born felon __PUNCT__ becaus our feder govern fail to protect our border from their entri __PUNCT__ and thi seriou derelict of duti must end __PUNCT__
our compass for labor who enter thi countri unlawfulli __PUNCT__ our understand of their struggl __PUNCT__ even as we act to secur the border __PUNCT__ speak well of america __PUNCT__
but thi respect doe not extend to crimin who came here to break our law and do harm to peopl __PUNCT__
through the crimin alien program __PUNCT__ we have made some progress in recent year __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ state ar left to deal with the high cost and excess regul involv in deport proceed __PUNCT__ and mani local offic ar left wait for immigr agent to show up on site __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will expand the crimin alien program __PUNCT__
we will requir that the feder govern assum more of the cost to deport and detain crimin alien __PUNCT__ becaus thi is a problem of the feder govern own make __PUNCT__
as if all of these challeng were not enough __PUNCT__ anoth ha arisen becaus of your own hard work and success these past __NUM__ year in send seriou offend to prison __PUNCT__
mani ar due for releas __PUNCT__ and just last year some __NUM__ inmat reenter societi __PUNCT__
unless we chang our approach over the next four year __PUNCT__ these releas prison ar like to reoffend in veri high number __PUNCT__ commit million of new crime and find million of new victim __PUNCT__
and we need to be as commit in prepar them for freedom as we were in take that freedom awai __PUNCT__
mayb you have heard the stori of an ex __PUNCT__ inmat name don cox __PUNCT__ who receiv a sentenc of __NUM__ year for be an accomplic to a murder right here in indianapoli in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ cox would like have spent the rest of hi life in prison __PUNCT__ had it not been for the effort of anoth man name tim streett __PUNCT__
in the short version of a power stori __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ streett is the son of the victim __PUNCT__ and had even been a wit to hi father murder __PUNCT__
he is also a wit to the possibl of redempt __PUNCT__
after year of bitter __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ streett sought out the prison __PUNCT__
in time __PUNCT__ he even becam hi friend __PUNCT__
and it wa he who ask prosecutor to seek parol for mr __PUNCT__ cox __PUNCT__
as tim streett explain hi chang of heart __PUNCT__ anger and bitter __PUNCT__ that can build up __PUNCT__
but true forgiv sai __PUNCT__ i forgiv you __PUNCT__ and it over __PUNCT__
across a prison and jail popul of __NUM__ million soul __PUNCT__ there mai be some who will never find or even seek thi path __PUNCT__
but the wai should be open to all __PUNCT__
thi wa the spirit of the second chanc act of __NUM__ a law design to make the walk out of prison __PUNCT__ past the gate and razor wire __PUNCT__ a on __PUNCT__ wai journei __PUNCT__
ex __PUNCT__ convict need more than a few buck and a bu ticket out of town __PUNCT__
mani will need job train __PUNCT__ a place to live __PUNCT__ mentor __PUNCT__ famili counsel __PUNCT__ and much more __PUNCT__
beyond govern __PUNCT__ there ar church and commun group all across our countri that stand readi to help even more __PUNCT__
and these group will have the commit support of my administr __PUNCT__
with so mani sentenc about to expir __PUNCT__ and so mani second chanc about to be offer __PUNCT__ the stake ar high for our countri __PUNCT__
and nobodi understand that better than sheriff __PUNCT__ their deputi __PUNCT__ and other offic of the peac __PUNCT__
