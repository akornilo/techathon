for much of our histori __PUNCT__ the world consid the unit state a young countri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we ar the world oldest constitut democraci __PUNCT__ yet we remain a young nation __PUNCT__
we still possess the attribut of youth __PUNCT__ spirit __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ vital __PUNCT__ and creativ __PUNCT__
america will alwai be young as long as we ar look forward __PUNCT__ and lead __PUNCT__ to a better world __PUNCT__
innov and energet american leadership is as vital to the world futur todai as it wa dure the cold war __PUNCT__
i have spent my life in public servic work to ensur our great nation is strong enough to counter those who wish us ill __PUNCT__
to be an effect leader in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ it is not enough to be strong __PUNCT__
we must be a model for other __PUNCT__
that mean not onli pursu our own interest but recogn that we share interest with peopl across our planet __PUNCT__
there is such a thing as good intern citizenship __PUNCT__ and america must be a good citizen of the world __PUNCT__ lead the wai to address the danger of global warm and preserv our environ __PUNCT__ strengthen exist intern institut and help to build new on __PUNCT__ and engag the world in a broad dialogu on the threat of violent extremist __PUNCT__ who would __PUNCT__ if thei could __PUNCT__ us weapon of mass destruct to attack us and our alli __PUNCT__
todai we also need to appli our spirit of optim __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ and innov to a crisi that ha been build for decad but is now come to a head __PUNCT__ the global spread of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
forti __PUNCT__ five year ago __PUNCT__ presid john f __PUNCT__ kennedi ask the american peopl to imagin what the world would look like if nuclear weapon spread beyond the few power that then held them to the mani other nation that sought them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ stop and think for a moment __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ what it would mean to have nuclear weapon in so mani hand __PUNCT__ in the hand of countri larg and small __PUNCT__ stabl and unstabl __PUNCT__ respons and irrespons __PUNCT__ scatter throughout the world __PUNCT__
if that happen __PUNCT__ he warn __PUNCT__ there would be no rest for anyon __PUNCT__
kennedi warn reson more todai than ever befor __PUNCT__
north korea pursu a nuclear weapon program to the point where __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ the dictat kim jong __PUNCT__ il ha test a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and almost certainli possess sever more nuclear warhead __PUNCT__
and it ha share it nuclear and missil know __PUNCT__ how with other __PUNCT__ includ syria __PUNCT__
it is a vital nation interest for the north korean nuclear program to be complet __PUNCT__ verifi and irrevers end __PUNCT__
likewis __PUNCT__ we have seen iran march with singl __PUNCT__ mind determin toward the same goal __PUNCT__
presid ahmadinejad ha threaten to wipe israel off the face of the earth __PUNCT__ and repres a threat to everi countri in the region __PUNCT__ on we cannot ignor or minim __PUNCT__
other nation have begun to wonder whether thei __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ need to have such weapon __PUNCT__ if onli in self __PUNCT__ defens __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ we could find ourselv in a world where a dozen or more nation __PUNCT__ small and larg __PUNCT__ stabl and unstabl __PUNCT__ respons and irrespons __PUNCT__ have viabl nuclear weapon program __PUNCT__
but there is a flip side to presid kennedi warn __PUNCT__
we should stop and think for a moment not onli of the peril of a world awash with nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ but also of the more hope altern __PUNCT__ a world in which there ar far fewer such weapon than there ar todai __PUNCT__ and in which prolifer __PUNCT__ instabl __PUNCT__ and nuclear terror ar far less like __PUNCT__
thi is the world it is our respons to build __PUNCT__
there is no simpl answer to the problem __PUNCT__
if you look back over the past two decad __PUNCT__ i don't think ani of us __PUNCT__ republican or democrat __PUNCT__ can take much satisfact in what we accomplish to control nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ some peopl seem to think thei discov a brand new caus __PUNCT__ someth no on befor them ever thought of __PUNCT__
mani believ all we need to do to end the nuclear program of hostil govern is have our presid talk with leader in pyongyang and tehran __PUNCT__ as if we haven't tri talk to these govern repeatedli over the past two decad __PUNCT__
other think militari action alon can achiev our goal __PUNCT__ as if militari action were not fraught with their own terribl risk __PUNCT__
while the us of forc mai be necessari __PUNCT__ it can onli be as a last resort not a first step __PUNCT__
the truth is we will onli address the terribl prospect of the worldwid spread of nuclear arm if we transcend our partisan differ __PUNCT__ combin our energi __PUNCT__ learn from our past mistak __PUNCT__ and seek practic and effect solut __PUNCT__
i like to suggest some step we should take to chart a common vision for the futur __PUNCT__
it is a vision in which the unit state return to a tradit of innov think __PUNCT__ broad __PUNCT__ mind internation __PUNCT__ and determin diplomaci __PUNCT__ back by america great and endur power to lead __PUNCT__
it is a vision not of the unit state act alon __PUNCT__ but build and particip in a commun of nation all drawn togeth in thi vital common purpos __PUNCT__
it is a vision of a respons america __PUNCT__ dedic to an endur peac base on freedom __PUNCT__
a quarter of a centuri ago __PUNCT__ presid ronald reagan declar __PUNCT__ our dream is to see the dai when nuclear weapon will be banish from the face of the earth __PUNCT__
that is my dream __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
it is a distant and difficult goal __PUNCT__
and we must proce toward it prudent and pragmat __PUNCT__ and with a focus concern for our secur and the secur of alli who depend on us __PUNCT__
but the cold war end almost twenti year ago __PUNCT__ and the time ha come to take further measur to reduc dramat the number of nuclear weapon in the world arsen __PUNCT__
it is time for the unit state to show the kind of leadership the world expect from us __PUNCT__ in the tradit of american presid who work to reduc the nuclear threat to mankind __PUNCT__
our highest prioriti must be to reduc the danger that nuclear weapon will ever be us __PUNCT__
such weapon __PUNCT__ while still import to deter an attack with weapon of mass destruct against us and our alli __PUNCT__ repres the most abhorr and indiscrimin form of warfar known to man __PUNCT__
we do __PUNCT__ quit liter __PUNCT__ possess the mean to destroi all of mankind __PUNCT__
we must seek to do all we can to ensur that nuclear weapon will never again be us __PUNCT__
while work close with alli who reli on our nuclear umbrella for their secur __PUNCT__ i would ask the joint chief of staff to engag in a comprehens review of all aspect of our nuclear strategi and polici __PUNCT__
i would keep an open mind on all respons propos __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we must continu to deploi a safe and reliabl nuclear deterr __PUNCT__ robust missil defens and superior convent forc that ar capabl of defend the unit state and our alli __PUNCT__
but i will seek to reduc the size of our nuclear arsen to the lowest number possibl consist with our secur requir and global commit __PUNCT__
todai we deploi thousand of nuclear warhead __PUNCT__
it is my hope to move as rapidli as possibl to a significantli smaller forc __PUNCT__
while we have seriou differ __PUNCT__ with the end of the cold war __PUNCT__ russia and the unit state ar no longer mortal enemi __PUNCT__
as our two countri possess the overwhelm major of the world nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ we have a special respons to reduc their number __PUNCT__
i believ we should reduc our nuclear forc to the lowest level we judg necessari __PUNCT__ and we should be prepar to enter into a new arm control agreement with russia reflect the nuclear reduct i will seek __PUNCT__
further __PUNCT__ we should be abl to agre with russia on bind verif measur base on those current in effect under the start agreement __PUNCT__ to enhanc confid and transpar __PUNCT__
in close consult with our alli __PUNCT__ i would also like to explor wai we and russia can reduc __PUNCT__ and hopefulli elimin __PUNCT__ deploy of tactic nuclear weapon in europ __PUNCT__
i also believ we should work with russia to build confid in our missil defens program __PUNCT__ includ through such initi as the share of earli warn data and prior notif of missil launch __PUNCT__
there ar other area in which we can work in partnership with russia to strengthen protect against weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
i would serious consid russia recent propos to work togeth to global the intermedi rang nuclear forc treati __PUNCT__
i would also redoubl our common effort to reduc the risk that nuclear __PUNCT__ chemic __PUNCT__ or biolog weapon mai fall into the hand of terrorist or unfriendli govern __PUNCT__
i believ we should also begin a dialogu with china on strateg and nuclear issu __PUNCT__
we have import share interest with china and should begin discuss wai to achiev the greatest possibl transpar and cooper on nuclear forc structur and doctrin __PUNCT__
we should work with china to encourag conform with the practic of the other four nuclear weapon state recogn in the non __PUNCT__ prolifer treati __PUNCT__ includ work toward nuclear arsen reduct and toward a moratorium on the product of addit fissil materi __PUNCT__
i believ we must also address nuclear test __PUNCT__
as presid i will pledg to continu america current moratorium on test __PUNCT__ but also begin a dialogu with our alli __PUNCT__ and with the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ to identifi wai we can move forward to limit test in a verifi manner that doe not undermin the secur or viabil of our nuclear deterr __PUNCT__
thi would includ take anoth look at the comprehens test ban treati to see what can be done to overcom the shortcom that prevent it from enter into forc __PUNCT__
i oppos that treati in __NUM__ but said at the time i would keep an open mind about futur develop __PUNCT__
i would onli support the develop of ani new type of nuclear weapon that is absolut essenti for the viabil of our deterr __PUNCT__ that result in make possibl further decreas in the size of our nuclear arsen __PUNCT__ and further our global nuclear secur goal __PUNCT__
i would cancel all further work on the so __PUNCT__ call robust nuclear earth penetr __PUNCT__ a weapon that doe not make strateg or polit sens __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we cannot achiev our non __PUNCT__ prolifer goal on our own __PUNCT__
we must strengthen exist intern treati and institut to combat prolifer __PUNCT__ and develop new on when necessari __PUNCT__
we should move quickli with other nation to negoti a fissil materi cut __PUNCT__ off treati to end product of the most danger nuclear materi __PUNCT__
the intern commun need to improv it abil to interdict the spread of nuclear weapon and materi under the prolifer secur initi __PUNCT__
and we need to increas fund for our own non __PUNCT__ prolifer effort __PUNCT__ includ the cooper threat reduct program establish by the landmark nunn __PUNCT__ lugar legisl __PUNCT__ and ensur the highest possibl standard of secur for exist nuclear materi __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ an intern confer will meet to review the non __PUNCT__ prolifer treati __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will seiz that opportun to strengthen and enhanc all aspect of the non __PUNCT__ prolifer regim __PUNCT__
we need to strengthen enforc of the so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ atom for peac __PUNCT__ bargain by insist that countri that receiv the benefit of peac nuclear cooper must return or dismantl what thei receiv if thei violat or withdraw from the npt __PUNCT__
we need to increas iaea fund and enhanc the intellig support it receiv __PUNCT__
we also need to revers the burden of proof when it come to discov whether a nation is cheat on it npt commit __PUNCT__
the iaea shouldn't have to plai cat __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ mous game to prove a countri is in complianc __PUNCT__
it is for suspect violat to prove thei ar in complianc __PUNCT__
we should establish a requir by the un secur council that intern transfer of sensit nuclear technolog must be disclos in advanc to an intern author such as the iaea __PUNCT__ and further requir that undisclos transfer be deem illicit and subject to interdict __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ to enforc treati oblig __PUNCT__ iaea member state must be will to impos sanction on nation that seek to withdraw from it __PUNCT__
we need to enlist all will partner in the global battl against nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__
i support the u.s. __PUNCT__ india civil nuclear accord as a mean of strengthen our relationship with the world largest democraci __PUNCT__ and further involv india in the fight against prolifer __PUNCT__
we should engag activ with both india and pakistan to improv the secur of nuclear stockpil and weapon materi __PUNCT__ and construct a secur global nuclear order that elimin the likelihood of prolifer and the possibl of nuclear conflict __PUNCT__
as we improv the nation and multilater tool to catch and revers illicit nuclear program __PUNCT__ i am convinc civilian nuclear energi can be a critic part of our fight against global warm __PUNCT__
civilian nuclear power provid a wai for the unit state and other respons nation to achiev energi independ and reduc our depend on foreign oil and ga __PUNCT__
but in order to take advantag of civilian nuclear energi __PUNCT__ we must do a better job of ensur it remain civilian __PUNCT__
some nation us the pretens of civilian nuclear program as cover for nuclear weapon program __PUNCT__
we need to build an intern consensu that expos thi decept __PUNCT__ and hold nation account for it __PUNCT__
we cannot continu allow nation to enrich and reprocess uranium __PUNCT__ ostens for civilian purpos __PUNCT__ and stand by impot as thei develop weapon program __PUNCT__
the most effect wai to prevent thi decept is to limit the further spread of enrich and reprocess __PUNCT__
to persuad countri to forego enrich and reprocess __PUNCT__ i would support intern guarante of nuclear fuel suppli to countri that renounc enrich and reprocess __PUNCT__ as well as the establish of multin nuclear enrich center in which thei can particip __PUNCT__
nation that seek nuclear fuel for legitim civilian purpos will be abl to acquir what thei need under intern supervis __PUNCT__
thi is on suggest russia and other have made to iran __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ the iranian govern ha so far reject thi idea __PUNCT__
perhap with enough outsid pressur and encourag __PUNCT__ thei can be persuad to chang their mind befor it is too late __PUNCT__
i would seek to establish an intern repositori for spent nuclear fuel that could collect and safe store materi oversea that might otherwis be reprocess to acquir bomb __PUNCT__ grade materi __PUNCT__
it is even possibl that such an intern center could make it unnecessari to open the propos spent nuclear fuel storag facil at yucca mountain in nevada __PUNCT__
thi is a long list of step we need to take __PUNCT__
it is long becaus there is no singl answer to thi crisi __PUNCT__ and there ar no easi answer __PUNCT__
it is long becaus no nation can meet thi dire challeng alon and none can be indiffer to it outcom __PUNCT__
the unit state cannot and will not stop the spread of nuclear weapon by unilater action __PUNCT__
we must lead concert and persist multilater effort __PUNCT__
as power as we ar __PUNCT__ america abil to defend ourselv and our alli against the threat of nuclear attack depend on our abil to encourag effect intern cooper __PUNCT__
we must strengthen the accord and institut that make such cooper possibl __PUNCT__
no problem we face pose a greater threat to us and the world than nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__
in a time when follow of a hate and remorseless ideolog ar will to destroi themselv to destroi us __PUNCT__ the threat of suicid bomber with the mean to wreak incomprehens devast should call the entir world to action __PUNCT__
the civil nation of the world must act as on or we will suffer consequ onc thought remot when the threat of mutual assur destruct could deter respons state from think the unthink __PUNCT__
american have alwai risen to the challeng of their time __PUNCT__
and we have alwai done so successfulli not by hide from histori __PUNCT__ but by make histori __PUNCT__ by encourag a sometim reluct world to follow our lead __PUNCT__ and defend civil from old mistak and old animos __PUNCT__ and the folli of reli on polici that no longer keep us safe __PUNCT__
i want to keep the countri i love and have serv all my life secur in our freedom __PUNCT__
i want us to rise to the challeng of our time __PUNCT__ as gener befor us rose to their __PUNCT__
it is incumb on america __PUNCT__ more than ani other nation on earth __PUNCT__ to lead in build the foundat for a stabl and endur peac __PUNCT__ a peac built on the strength of our commit to it __PUNCT__ on the transform ideal on which we were found __PUNCT__ on our abil to see around the corner of histori __PUNCT__ and on our courag and wisdom to make new and better choic __PUNCT__
no matter how danger the threat we face in our dai __PUNCT__ it still remain within our power to make in our time anoth __PUNCT__ better world than we inherit __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is what i am run for presid to do __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
