mccain __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ peter __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ i appreci it __PUNCT__
i want to ask you about some of your econom idea __PUNCT__ but i need to begin by ask you about your competit __PUNCT__
democrat debat last night __PUNCT__
i gather you didn't catch much of the debat __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i did not __PUNCT__
i obvious heard some of the dissect of it and analysi thi morn __PUNCT__ but i did not watch it last night __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ your name __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ came up sever time __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i am sure __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ chuckl __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ let me ask you about on aspect of the debat __PUNCT__
senat clinton said last night __PUNCT__ and mayb you can help democrat out on thi __PUNCT__ that senat obama comment about pennsylvania voter __PUNCT__ small __PUNCT__ time pennsylvania voter be bitter about some issu __PUNCT__ also hi connect to reverend wright that have drawn so much attent __PUNCT__ that that would be ampl ammunit for you in a gener elect __PUNCT__
is she right __PUNCT__ is that go to be fair game __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ in the case of reverend wright __PUNCT__ i have express in the past that i am sure that senat obama doe not share the extremist statement that reverend wright made __PUNCT__
but in the case of pennsylvania made __PUNCT__ i think it veri reveal __PUNCT__ a veri elitist statement __PUNCT__ a failur to recogn histori __PUNCT__
these ar the peopl from these __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ small town __PUNCT__ that went through on of the worst econom period in america histori call the great depress __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ yet __PUNCT__ thei the on who __PUNCT__ when the call came went out __PUNCT__ and we call them our greatest gener __PUNCT__ went out and made the world safe for democraci and defeat an enemi and serv and sacrif __PUNCT__ not becaus thei were depress by the econom situat nor were thei driven to their fundament faith and valu or their respect for the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__ the second amend __PUNCT__ but becaus thei had an ultim faith and hope and belief in america and it futur __PUNCT__
those peopl still have that __PUNCT__
and to attribut our fundament valu and belief that these peopl have __PUNCT__ not onli in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ but all over america __PUNCT__ to some kind of econom circumst is probabl as out of touch as anyth i ever seen __PUNCT__
and i note with some interest that senat obama basic defend those statement and continu to do to thi dai __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ i think it would be becaus that realli is a fundament differ between myself and senat obama about our faith and confid and trust in the american peopl __PUNCT__
when you don't have that kind of trust and faith in the american peopl __PUNCT__ then you want govern to do thing for them __PUNCT__
i want the peopl to do thing __PUNCT__ not the govern __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ let talk about the econom circumst face american right now __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ i go to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question __PUNCT__
you think if american were ask __PUNCT__ ar you better off todai than you were befor georg bush took offic more than seven year ago __PUNCT__ what answer would thei give __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ certainli __PUNCT__ in thi time __PUNCT__ we ar in veri challeng time __PUNCT__
we all recogn that __PUNCT__
famili ar sit around the kitchen tabl thi even and figur out whether thei go to be abl to keep their home or not __PUNCT__
thei figur out whether thei __PUNCT__ why it is that suddenli and recent someon in their famili or their neighbor ha lost their job __PUNCT__
there no doubt that we ar in enorm difficulti __PUNCT__
i think if you look at the overal record and million of job have been creat __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__ you could make an argument that there been great progress econom over that period of time __PUNCT__
but that no comfort __PUNCT__
that no comfort to famili now that ar face these tremend econom challeng __PUNCT__
but let me just add __PUNCT__ peter __PUNCT__ the fundament of america economi ar strong __PUNCT__
we the greatest export __PUNCT__ the greatest import __PUNCT__ the greatest innov __PUNCT__ the greatest produc __PUNCT__ still the greatest econom engin in the world __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ export and free trade ar a kei element in econom recoveri __PUNCT__
but these ar tough time __PUNCT__ tough time __PUNCT__ and nobodi know that more than american famili includ in small town of pennsylvania __PUNCT__
thei haven't lost their fundament religi belief __PUNCT__ their respect for the constitut __PUNCT__ their right to bear arm __PUNCT__
thei ar still __PUNCT__ keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ let talk about some of your econom idea __PUNCT__
you roll them out thi weekend in pittsburgh __PUNCT__
you talk about cut the corpor tax rate __PUNCT__ you talk about expand the exempt for children __PUNCT__ doubl that __PUNCT__ you also talk about repeal the altern minimum tax on top of __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ could we __PUNCT__ do you want to mention those in order or a larger question __PUNCT__ go ahead __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ i go to add to that the biggi and that make the bush tax cut perman __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ you also talk about freez discretionari spend for a year __PUNCT__ remov earmark __PUNCT__
democrat __PUNCT__ even some republican that i talk to can sai there no wai you can do all of those thing and still balanc the budget __PUNCT__
you still can't do that without ad to the deficit __PUNCT__
ar thei wrong __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ you cannot have declin revenu and sever econom difficulti and balanc the budget __PUNCT__
we all know that when the economi is wors then revenu declin __PUNCT__
we can go back to jack kennedi when he cut capit gain and we had econom growth and therefor increas revenu __PUNCT__
so all i can tell you is that these ar tough thing __PUNCT__ but it now time for chang __PUNCT__
and that kind of chang is the action that i talk about __PUNCT__ includ freez discretionari spend for a year __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ why is it that __PUNCT__ as we speak __PUNCT__ the unit state senat is go to refus to vote on a ga __PUNCT__ tax holidai for everi american to give them a littl break thi summer when thei travel and yet thei ad pork __PUNCT__ barrel project after pork __PUNCT__ barrel project to the tune of billion to our highwai system __PUNCT__ which doesn't go to the area of the greatest need __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ on of the critic is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi will harm our abil to restor our basic need __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ if we cut out the earmark __PUNCT__ if we cut out the bridg to nowher __PUNCT__ which senat obama vote for __PUNCT__ if we cut out the bridg to nowher and the billion of dollar of pork __PUNCT__ barrel project __PUNCT__ why don't we move that monei to our veri vital infrastructur need as oppos to just ad pork __PUNCT__ barrel project onto it __PUNCT__
so of cours we need to __PUNCT__ cook __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl see earmark as __PUNCT__ perhap repugn as those mai be to a lot of american voter __PUNCT__ that the seriou sum of monei you talk about last year wa about __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ that it just not enough to do what you talk about in term of tax cut __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that just fundament misunderstand of what go on in congress __PUNCT__
there were __MONEY__ billion total in two year of pork __PUNCT__ barrel project __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion sign into law by the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it wa an addit __MONEY__ billion pork __PUNCT__ barrel project that were put on and the crazi wai that we do budget __PUNCT__ those then becam part of the baselin __PUNCT__
so we increas spend by some __MONEY__ billion that i could elimin in a new york minut if we had the gut to do it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion is not chump chang __PUNCT__
and then when you look at a freez in discretionari spend __PUNCT__ when you look at reform in defens procur __PUNCT__ which i save the taxpay by myself __PUNCT__ not by myself __PUNCT__ with the help of a lot of wonder peopl __PUNCT__ of __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion on a flaw boe deal that ha sent peopl to jail __PUNCT__
so to somehow believ __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that just a small amount __PUNCT__ you know what that is __PUNCT__ my dear friend __PUNCT__ that is a cop __PUNCT__ out __PUNCT__
that is a cop __PUNCT__ out becaus the american peopl no longer believ that we ar care steward of their tax dollar __PUNCT__
so when we ask them to reform medicar and social secur __PUNCT__ while we spend billion on these wast project __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ million in most commun in american isn't chump chang __PUNCT__
that wa the cost of the bridg to nowher __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ let me ask you about hous becaus you said you wouldn't plai polit with the hous crisi __PUNCT__
you also said a month ago __PUNCT__ i want to quot you directli here __PUNCT__ it is not the duti of govern to bail out and reward those who act irrespons whether thei ar big bank or small borrow __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ now you propos __PUNCT__ potenti __PUNCT__ feder taxpay help to as mani as __NUM__ american face the risk of foreclosur includ some who got in over their head becaus of decis thei made __PUNCT__
ar you plai polit with thi __PUNCT__ is it fair for peopl to suggest thi might be a flip __PUNCT__ flop __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't think it fair __PUNCT__ peter __PUNCT__ becaus i also said in that statement that there ar hard __PUNCT__ work american famili that find themselv in the conundrum of all of a sudden ratchet up of their mortgag payment __PUNCT__ which thei had no control of nor were not awar when thei sign the document __PUNCT__ and thei could afford the previou payment __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ so none of the __NUM__ sir __PUNCT__ ar guilti of simpli sign __PUNCT__ look at hous thei want to bui and couldn't afford __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it ha to be a primari resid __PUNCT__ thei have to provid proof that thei could afford the mortgag payment at the time __PUNCT__
there ar certain paramet __PUNCT__
that why it __NUM__ and not everybodi __PUNCT__
but i think there ar legitim homeown who ar in their primari resid who should be elig for a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year fix rate guarante by the fha loan and therebi help both the lender and the borrow __PUNCT__
it seem to me that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ relief to __NUM__ peopl who ar basic caught up in thi crisi is a legitim role for govern __PUNCT__
it not a legitim role to reward the specul __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ thi ha to be primari resid __PUNCT__
it is not a reward for greedi peopl on wall street __PUNCT__
that is why i have also ask for a depart of justic investig of some of these practic on wall street __PUNCT__
and i find it obscen when some of these execut take major pai packag as a reward when ordinari american famili ar risk the loss of the american dream __PUNCT__ which is their home __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ there is a debat go on right now whether alan greenspan __PUNCT__ when he wa the fed chairman __PUNCT__ kept interest rate too low __PUNCT__ and that is part of the problem we ar see __PUNCT__ not onli with the economi __PUNCT__ but with the hous situat as well __PUNCT__
do you have a view on that __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i view alan greenspan stewardship __PUNCT__ and i know thi mai be in contradict to some peopl opinion __PUNCT__ i believ hi overal stewardship __PUNCT__ i believ __NUM__ year as chairman of the fed __PUNCT__ as have been good for america economi __PUNCT__ whether he kept interest rate too low or too high __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ that is a judgment made by the feder reserv __PUNCT__ and politician __PUNCT__ by intent __PUNCT__ ar kept out of it __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ congress doe not set interest rate __PUNCT__
histori __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ will judg alan greenspan rather well __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ if you did __PUNCT__ would you be lower them next week __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__ i would __PUNCT__
is there ani politician that wouldn't __PUNCT__ chuckl __PUNCT__ that would sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i want you to pai higher interest rate __PUNCT__ that is why we put that respons in the hand of the fed __PUNCT__ not in the hand of the __PUNCT__ mai i sai __PUNCT__ politician who believ in short __PUNCT__ term gratif __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ let me ask a coupl quick issu befor we leav you here __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ cough __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__ i sorri __PUNCT__
sure __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ climat chang __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__ thi is on of the area you have broken with the presid __PUNCT__
you have support mandatori greenhous ga emiss cap __PUNCT__
the presid signal for the first time he want to stop the growth of greenhous ga emiss by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
there is a bill about to hit the senat floor __PUNCT__ which would cap and reduc greenhous ga emiss about __NUM__ percent by the year __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it is be offer by your good friend __PUNCT__ joe lieberman __PUNCT__
ar you go to support that bill __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i will support if we have a dramat increas role for nuclear power __PUNCT__
the radic environment group ar still plai too great a role in thi legisl __PUNCT__
nuclear power ha got to be a veri big part of ani effect action to reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__
i am glad that congress is move __PUNCT__
in due respect of the presid __PUNCT__ it is not enough __PUNCT__ and it is too late __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
let me ask you about the vice __PUNCT__ presidenti select process that you ar begin here __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ have you narrow your choic at all __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ chuckl __PUNCT__
but we ar move along __PUNCT__ we ar move along __PUNCT__
but we have found __PUNCT__ and i realli have and it unfortun __PUNCT__ anytim anyon name is mention __PUNCT__ then immedi thei ar almost subject to an invas of privaci __PUNCT__
so we ar just move along with the process __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ should anyon who is consid for the job expect that a vice presid under presid john mccain would have less author and power than dick chenei ha for georg bush __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ it ha got to be a team __PUNCT__ and i think thei have got to work togeth __PUNCT__
certainli i believ in parcel out respons __PUNCT__ whether it be to the vice presid or cabinet member __PUNCT__
i believ in deleg __PUNCT__ and i think that that is on of the great aspect of great leader is deleg of author and respons __PUNCT__
but everi presid achiev a relationship with their vice presid __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ did the vice presid exce the bound of that offic in ani wai __PUNCT__ do you think __PUNCT__ dure the cours of the last seven year __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it is not so much exceed the bound of offic __PUNCT__
i think some decis were made __PUNCT__ and i sure with the presid __PUNCT__ in the issu of tortur that i don't agre with __PUNCT__ but i don't know if it quot __PUNCT__ exceed the bound of hi author __PUNCT__
as far as i know __PUNCT__ everyth that the vice presid ha done wa with the consult and agreement of the presid __PUNCT__
cook __PUNCT__ final question __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__
ar you look forward to final have a singl democrat oppon to take on __PUNCT__ and will you know who that person is after pennsylvania on tuesdai __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__ i am look forward to get the campaign crank up __PUNCT__

the relationship __PUNCT__ as far as senat obama and senat clinton and their chanc __PUNCT__ were differ than thei ar todai __PUNCT__
and i am sure the next time we get togeth __PUNCT__ thei mai be differ again __PUNCT__
on thing about thi primari season on both side of the aisl __PUNCT__ i think you would agre __PUNCT__ it veri unpredict __PUNCT__ includ in my case __PUNCT__
