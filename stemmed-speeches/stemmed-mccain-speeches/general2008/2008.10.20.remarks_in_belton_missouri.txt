it great to be here in missouri __PUNCT__
we need to win missouri on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and with your help __PUNCT__ we go to win missouri __PUNCT__ and bring real chang to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
we get close to elect dai __PUNCT__ and last week it almost seem like there were three candid in thi race __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ me and joe the plumber __PUNCT__
joe can actual claim an achiev that few can top __PUNCT__ he the onli person to get a real answer out of senat obama about hi plan for our countri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ joe didn't ask for senat obama to come to hi hous __PUNCT__ and he didn't ask to be famou __PUNCT__
he certainli didn't ask for the polit attack on him from the obama campaign __PUNCT__
joe dream is to own a small busi that will creat job __PUNCT__ and the attack on him ar an attack on small busi all over the countri __PUNCT__
whether it joe the plumber or ed the dairyman __PUNCT__ small busi emploi __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
we need to support small busi __PUNCT__ not tax them __PUNCT__
after month of campaign trail eloqu __PUNCT__ we final learn what senat obama econom goal is __PUNCT__
as he told joe __PUNCT__ he want to quot __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
he believ in redistribut wealth __PUNCT__ not in polici that grow our economi and creat job and opportun for all american __PUNCT__
senat obama is more interest in control who get your piec of the pie than he is in grow the pie __PUNCT__
thi explain some big problem with my oppon claim that he will cut incom tax for __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
you might ask __PUNCT__ how do you cut incom tax for __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ when more than __NUM__ percent pai no incom tax right now __PUNCT__ how do you reduc the number zero __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the kei to barack obama whole plan __PUNCT__ sinc you can't reduc incom tax on those who pai zero __PUNCT__ the govern will write them all check call a tax credit __PUNCT__
and the treasuri will have to cover those check by tax other peopl __PUNCT__ includ a lot of folk just like joe __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ barack obama plan to rais tax on some in order to give check to other is not a tax cut __PUNCT__ it just anoth govern giveawai __PUNCT__
the obama tax increas would come at the worst possibl time for america __PUNCT__ and especi for small busi like the on joe dream of own __PUNCT__
the small busi senat obama would tax provid __NUM__ million job in america __PUNCT__
and a sudden tax hike for those busi will kill job at a time when need to be creat more job __PUNCT__
i not go to let that happen __PUNCT__
america ha an altern to the phoni tax cut my oppon start talk about onli month ago __PUNCT__
the mccain __PUNCT__ palin tax cut is the real thing __PUNCT__
we go to doubl the child deduct for everi famili __PUNCT__
we will cut the capit gain tax __PUNCT__
and we will cut busi tax to help creat job __PUNCT__ and keep american busi in america __PUNCT__
as joe ha now remind us all __PUNCT__ america didn't becom the greatest nation on earth by give our monei to the govern to __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
in thi countri __PUNCT__ we believ in spread opportun __PUNCT__ for those who need job and those who creat them __PUNCT__
and that is exactli what i intend to do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
the next presid won't have time to get us to the offic __PUNCT__
we face mani challeng here at home __PUNCT__ and mani enemi abroad in thi danger world __PUNCT__
just last night __PUNCT__ senat biden guarante that if senat obama is elect __PUNCT__ we will have an intern crisi to test america new presid __PUNCT__
we don't want a presid who invit test from the world at a time when our economi is in crisi and american ar alreadi fight in two war __PUNCT__
what is more troubl is that senat biden told their campaign donor that when that crisi hit __PUNCT__ thei would have to stand with them becaus it wouldn't be appar senat obama would have the right respons __PUNCT__
forget appar __PUNCT__
senat obama won't have the right respons __PUNCT__ and we know that becaus we seen the wrong respons from him over and over dure thi campaign __PUNCT__
