senat obama is run to spread the wealth __PUNCT__
i run to creat more wealth __PUNCT__
senat obama is run to punish the success __PUNCT__
i run to make everyon success __PUNCT__
senat obama ha made a lot of promis __PUNCT__
first he said peopl make less than __NUM__ dollar would benefit from hi plan __PUNCT__ then thi weekend he announc in an ad that if you a famili make less than __NUM__ dollar you benefit __PUNCT__ but thi week __PUNCT__ senat biden said tax relief should onli go to __PUNCT__ middl class peopl __PUNCT__ peopl make under __NUM__ dollar a year __PUNCT__
just todai __PUNCT__ bill richardson said it appli to famili make __NUM__ dollar a year __PUNCT__
it interest how their definit of rich ha a wai of creep down __PUNCT__
senat obama vote __NUM__ time for tax increas or against tax cut __PUNCT__
at thi rate __PUNCT__ it won't be long befor senat obama is right back to hi vote that american make just __NUM__ dollar a year should get a tax increas __PUNCT__
i not go to let that happen __PUNCT__
now he sai that if you don't want to pai higher tax you quot __PUNCT__ selfish __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ he view higher tax not in econom term __PUNCT__ but in moral term __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter to him that higher tax will hurt our economi and kill job __PUNCT__ he believ the govern ha a moral claim on your hard earn dollar __PUNCT__

i go to protect medicar __PUNCT__
i not go to let thi congress tax awai your retir save __PUNCT__
my oppon massiv new tax increas is exactli the wrong approach in an econom slowdown __PUNCT__
the answer to a slow economi is not higher tax __PUNCT__ but that is exactli what is go to happen when the democrat have total control of washington __PUNCT__
we can't let that happen __PUNCT__
we need pro __PUNCT__ growth and pro __PUNCT__ job econom polici __PUNCT__ not pro __PUNCT__ govern spend program paid for with higher tax __PUNCT__
thi is the fundament differ between senat obama and me __PUNCT__
we both disagre with presid bush on econom polici __PUNCT__
the differ is that he think tax have been too low __PUNCT__ and i think that spend ha been too high __PUNCT__
if we ar go to chang washington __PUNCT__ we need a presid who ha actual fought for chang and made it happen __PUNCT__
the next presid won't have time to get us to the offic __PUNCT__
we face mani challeng here at home __PUNCT__ and mani enemi abroad in thi danger world __PUNCT__

we had a target __PUNCT__
i know how close we came to a nuclear war and i will not be a presid who need to be test __PUNCT__
we know senat obama won't have the right respons to that test __PUNCT__ becaus we seen the wrong respons from him over and over dure thi campaign __PUNCT__
he oppos the surg strategi that is bring us victori in iraq and will bring us victori in afghanistan __PUNCT__
he said he would sit down uncondition with the world worst dictat __PUNCT__
when russia invad georgia __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama said the invad countri should show restraint __PUNCT__

when i am presid __PUNCT__ we ar go to win in iraq and win in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and our troop will come home with honor __PUNCT__
our troop ar succeed __PUNCT__ and when i am presid __PUNCT__ thei will come home in victori __PUNCT__ not in defeat __PUNCT__
let me give you some straight talk about the state of the race todai __PUNCT__
there just __NUM__ dai left __PUNCT__
the pundit have written us off __PUNCT__ just like thei done befor __PUNCT__
my oppon is work out the detail with speaker pelosi and senat reid of their plan to rais your tax __PUNCT__ increas spend __PUNCT__ and conced defeat in iraq __PUNCT__
