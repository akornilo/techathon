thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
i appreci the hospit of saint anselm colleg and it great to be here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ it alwai a good dai for me when i in new hampshir __PUNCT__
we go back a long wai __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__
i learn a lot over the year from the peopl of thi state __PUNCT__
and i know on thing for certain __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter what the pundit think or how confid my oppon is __PUNCT__
the peopl of new hampshir make their own decis __PUNCT__ and more than onc __PUNCT__ thei ignor the poll and the pundit __PUNCT__ and brought me across the finish line first __PUNCT__
i can't think of ani place i rather be as elect dai draw close than run an underdog campaign in new hampshir __PUNCT__
as i said __PUNCT__ my oppon look pretti confid these dai __PUNCT__
he be address the nation soon __PUNCT__
he got anoth of those big stadium spectacl in the work __PUNCT__
but act like the elect is over won't let him take awai your chanc to have the final sai in thi elect __PUNCT__
everi so often __PUNCT__ my oppon give us all a littl glimps of what an obama presid would be like in the real world __PUNCT__
and last week hi campaign actual found itself on a detour into the real world __PUNCT__ in the drivewai of joe the plumber __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ joe didn't ask for senat obama to come to hi hous __PUNCT__ and he didn't ask to be famou __PUNCT__
he certainli didn't ask for the polit attack on him from the obama campaign __PUNCT__
joe dream is to own a small busi that will creat job __PUNCT__ and the attack on him ar an attack on small busi all over the countri __PUNCT__
small busi emploi __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ and we need to help small busi __PUNCT__ and not rais their tax __PUNCT__
as it happen __PUNCT__ the obama tax increas is just what joe had on hi mind __PUNCT__
so joe show the obama travel press how to ask a tough question __PUNCT__ and get an answer instead of just anoth talk point __PUNCT__
thank to him __PUNCT__ we final learn what senat obama econom goal is __PUNCT__
as he told joe __PUNCT__ barack obama want to __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ joe and gui like him will earn the wealth __PUNCT__
barack and politician like him will spread it __PUNCT__
joe didn't realli like that idea __PUNCT__ and neither did a lot of other folk who believ that their earn ar their own __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ befor govern can redistribut wealth __PUNCT__ it ha to confisc wealth from those who earn it __PUNCT__
and whatev the right word is for that wai of think __PUNCT__ the redistribut of wealth is the last thing america need right now __PUNCT__
in these tough econom time __PUNCT__ we don't need govern __PUNCT__ spread the wealth __PUNCT__ we need polici that creat wealth and spread opportun __PUNCT__
it wa a candid moment for senat obama __PUNCT__ in the presenc of a skeptic voter __PUNCT__
and in a campaign as disciplin and care as my oppon __PUNCT__ the worst misstep come when the candid sai what he realli think __PUNCT__
we seen thi befor __PUNCT__
in a debat with senat clinton __PUNCT__ he wa ask why on earth he want to rais capit gain tax __PUNCT__ when histori show that cut that tax rate actual yield more revenu to the govern __PUNCT__
rate were cut in the clinton year __PUNCT__ revenu went up __PUNCT__
rate were cut in the bush year __PUNCT__ revenu went up __PUNCT__
my oppon answer wa that tax still had to be rais as a matter of __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__
let think about thi veri carefulli __PUNCT__
here we have a case where increas tax would decreas the fund avail for all the spend govern doe __PUNCT__
but senat obama insist on a tax hike __PUNCT__ as a matter of principl __PUNCT__
and the principl seem to be the redistribut of wealth as an end in itself __PUNCT__
appar __PUNCT__ as my oppon see it __PUNCT__ there is a strict limit to your earn and wealth __PUNCT__ and it for politician to decid __PUNCT__
the proper amount of wealth is not what you can earn __PUNCT__ but what govern will let you keep __PUNCT__
my oppon ha spoken about the reluct of citizen and busi owner to part with their earn __PUNCT__
he understand that when it time to spread the wealth around __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ thei ar not go to give up those profit easili __PUNCT__
and reader of hi book __PUNCT__ the audac of hope __PUNCT__ might recal that he wrote about the need to __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__ there __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
he write of the need for __PUNCT__ labor law and tax law that restor some balanc to the distribut of the nation wealth __PUNCT__
he ha talk elsewher about how __PUNCT__ in our dai __PUNCT__ the distribut of wealth is even more skew __PUNCT__ and level of inequ ar now higher __PUNCT__
what ar realli skew in all of thi ar my oppon prioriti __PUNCT__
he talk about our economi in a detach and academ wai __PUNCT__ forget that the goal is not to redistribut wealth but to creat it __PUNCT__
and on thing academ ar good at is invent and redefin term __PUNCT__ which is what he up to with that phoni incom tax cut for __NUM__ percent of the american peopl __PUNCT__
when a politician tell you he go to cut incom tax for __NUM__ percent of all american __PUNCT__ it reason to wonder how he go to do that for the __NUM__ percent who pai no incom tax at all __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ ten of million of american have an incom tax bill of zero __PUNCT__
how barack obama go to reduc the number zero __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the kei to hi whole plan __PUNCT__ sinc you can't reduc incom tax on those who pai zero __PUNCT__ the govern will write them all check call a tax credit __PUNCT__
and the treasuri will have to cover those check by tax other peopl __PUNCT__ includ mani small busi and a lot of folk just like joe the plumber __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ barack obama plan to rais tax on some in order to give check to other is not a tax cut __PUNCT__ it just anoth govern giveawai __PUNCT__
what should realli worri us is that senat obama can't possibl spend all the monei he promis to spend without rais tax even more than he admit he will or dig us even further into debt __PUNCT__ weaken the dollar and make everyth you bui __PUNCT__ from groceri to gasolin more expens __PUNCT__
he ha promis in the neighborhood of a trillion dollar in new spend over the next four year __PUNCT__ and hi tax increas won't cover all of it __PUNCT__
he talk a lot about __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ in energi for america __PUNCT__
hi plan doesn't have much to do with actual product from exist energi sourc __PUNCT__ like offshor oil or nuclear power __PUNCT__
but it doe requir __NUM__ billion dollar of new feder energi spend over the next ten year __PUNCT__
for infrastructur __PUNCT__ he promis anoth sixti billion dollar __PUNCT__ for the depart of educ __PUNCT__ anoth __NUM__ billion dollar over four year __PUNCT__
the list goe on through all sort of other item ten billion here __PUNCT__ anoth twenti there until final we come to hi new feder health care program __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ by senat obama own account __PUNCT__ is go to cost at least __NUM__ billion dollar a year __PUNCT__
so let try to get all thi straight __PUNCT__
my oppon sai he go to cut incom tax for __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ includ that miracul reduct for those who aren't pai ani right now __PUNCT__
then he commit to more than a trillion dollar in new feder spend __PUNCT__
and even after vote for the __NUM__ billion dollar rescu packag earlier thi month __PUNCT__ he won't even specifi a singl cut in spend that he would consid __PUNCT__
that leav us with almost two trillion dollar in new spend to which barack obama stand commit __PUNCT__ and no explan at all of how he is go to pai for it __PUNCT__
doe anyon serious believ that these trillion of dollar ar go to come from onli the veri highest incom earner __PUNCT__ even hi support ar skeptic __PUNCT__
democrat senat jai rockefel of west virginia said of these plan __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ there is not enough monei to do all thi stuff __PUNCT__
an influenti newspap call hi claim __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ neither polit nor econom plausibl __PUNCT__
that critiqu came from the editori board of the new york time __PUNCT__ and when barack obama lose them you know he gone too far __PUNCT__
for my part __PUNCT__ i have set befor america an altern to the phoni tax cut my oppon start talk about onli month ago __PUNCT__
my tax cut is the real thing __PUNCT__
we go to doubl the child deduct for everi famili __PUNCT__
we will cut the capit gain tax __PUNCT__
we will end tax on unemploy benefit __PUNCT__
and we will cut busi tax to help creat job __PUNCT__ and keep american busi in america __PUNCT__
as joe ha now remind us all __PUNCT__ america didn't becom the greatest nation on earth by give our monei to the govern to __PUNCT__ spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
in thi countri __PUNCT__ we believ in spread opportun __PUNCT__ for those who need job and those who creat them __PUNCT__
and that is exactli what i intend to do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
thi is the choic that we face __PUNCT__
these ar hard time __PUNCT__
our economi is in crisi __PUNCT__
american ar fight in two war __PUNCT__
we face mani enemi in thi danger world __PUNCT__ and mani challeng here at home __PUNCT__
the next presid won't have time to get us to the offic __PUNCT__
he cannot invit test from the world __PUNCT__
he will have to act immedi __PUNCT__
we cannot spend the next four year as we have spent much of the last eight __PUNCT__ hope for our luck to chang __PUNCT__
we have to act immedi __PUNCT__
i said it at the last debat __PUNCT__ i not georg bush __PUNCT__ if senat obama want to run against georg bush __PUNCT__ he should have run for presid four year ago __PUNCT__
we need a new direct now __PUNCT__
we have to fight for it __PUNCT__
what america need in thi hour is a fighter __PUNCT__ someon who put all hi card on the tabl and trust the judgment of the american peopl __PUNCT__
