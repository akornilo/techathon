mccain __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ chri __PUNCT__
it nice to be back __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ your advis sai that you ar go to campaign in place that republican presidenti candid usual don't __PUNCT__ inner citi __PUNCT__ rural alabama __PUNCT__ appalachia __PUNCT__
do you plan to run as a differ kind of republican __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i believ that the parti of abraham lincoln and teddi roosevelt and ronald reagan __PUNCT__ that that a tradit of the republican parti __PUNCT__ that we need to go all over america __PUNCT__ and not just the specif place you talk about __PUNCT__ but compet hard in everi section of the countri __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ california __PUNCT__
california can no longer be written off __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__
and that mean go to all part of that state and reach out to hispan voter __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ other __PUNCT__
i know that you know __PUNCT__ chri __PUNCT__ that on of the recent trend which mai not have been as understood as well as some other thing is that there thi dramat rise in the independ voter registr __PUNCT__ whether it be in my state or all across america __PUNCT__
the independ voter will make an even larger differ __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ in the __NUM__ elect __PUNCT__
so i have to energ our base __PUNCT__ get the independ and the old and new __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ reagan democrat __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ i think you might agre that republican have too often been portrai __PUNCT__ and perhap too often act __PUNCT__ as the parti of the have at the expens of the have __PUNCT__ not __PUNCT__
you here todai at the civil right museum __PUNCT__ but it ha come to our attent that in __NUM__ you vote against the feder holidai for martin luther king __PUNCT__
you vote in __NUM__ against civil right legisl __PUNCT__
isn't it go to be hard to reach out to all those group given your histori and the histori of the parti __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let me sai in __NUM__ i wa wrong __PUNCT__ and i believ that my advocaci for the recognit of dr __PUNCT__ king birthdai in arizona wa someth that i proud of __PUNCT__
the issu in the earli __PUNCT__ 90 wa a littl more complic __PUNCT__
i never believ in quota __PUNCT__ and i don't __PUNCT__
there no doubt about my view on that issu __PUNCT__
and that wa the implic __PUNCT__ at least __PUNCT__ of that other vote __PUNCT__
but i wa wrong in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and all of us make mistak __PUNCT__ and i think nobodi recogn that more than dr __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ karl rove __PUNCT__ who now work with fox new __PUNCT__ doe map for us base on the averag of recent public poll __PUNCT__
you haven't seen these __PUNCT__ but you might be interest __PUNCT__
and what thei indic is that tradit democrat stronghold like pennsylvania __PUNCT__ like michigan __PUNCT__ like minnesota ar up for grab thi year __PUNCT__
you talk about california __PUNCT__
is thi not go to be a red state __PUNCT__ blue state elect __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't think so in the tradit wai __PUNCT__
i think that all of these state __PUNCT__ or most of them __PUNCT__ ar up for grab __PUNCT__
you seen a dramat increas in hispan voter in my part of the countri __PUNCT__ but also mani other part of the countri __PUNCT__
in the southeast __PUNCT__ the greatest popul increas ha been hispan voter __PUNCT__
we probabl ar go to see voter more activ __PUNCT__ african american voter as well as hispan as well as other __PUNCT__
and also __PUNCT__ it pretti clear that senat obama and senat clinton have energ the younger voter __PUNCT__
and i believ i have __PUNCT__
and i believ i got to compet on that ground __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
that why i go on show that young peopl watch __PUNCT__
so i not sure that the old red state __PUNCT__ blue state scenario that prevail for the last sever elect work __PUNCT__
i think most of these state that we have either red or blue ar go to be up for grab __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ it a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ state battleground __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i believ so __PUNCT__ if not __NUM__ certainli the major of them __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ as a report __PUNCT__ on of the thing i alwai notic about you is you not veri good at hide your true feel __PUNCT__
thi week you said barack obama __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ doesn't understand nation secur __PUNCT__ ha no background __PUNCT__ no experi on these issu __PUNCT__
a few week ago __PUNCT__ you said he deceiv voter with eloqu but empti rhetor __PUNCT__
put asid your differ on issu __PUNCT__ straight talk __PUNCT__ is barack obama qualifi to be presid __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ if the voter decid that of america __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
i believ that my talent and my background and my experi __PUNCT__ which ha led to my judgment __PUNCT__ is __PUNCT__ i think qualifi me more __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ or i wouldn't be seek the presid __PUNCT__
let me just sai again that wa in respons __PUNCT__ when i said he wa inexperienc and doe not have the background __PUNCT__ to the charg of thi __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year in iraq __PUNCT__ and it wa obviou when you read the whole quot __PUNCT__ and i hope that at some point we could see that __PUNCT__ where i wa in an exchang with a voter in new hampshir __PUNCT__ a town hall meet __PUNCT__ the kind of exchang that i enjoi most __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ how long ar you go to be there __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ it could be __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but it a matter of u. __PUNCT__ casualti __PUNCT__ and we have presenc in countri like south korea __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__
so it veri clear __PUNCT__
and senat obama and anyon who read that know that i didn't think we were in a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year war __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ but i want to go to the bigger issu __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ which is that you said obama doesn't understand nation secur __PUNCT__ ha no experi __PUNCT__ no background on these issu __PUNCT__
i understand the voter ar go to make up their mind __PUNCT__
in john mccain opinion __PUNCT__ doe someon who ha no background in nation secur __PUNCT__ is he fit to be command in chief __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i not duck your question __PUNCT__ chri __PUNCT__
you could make an argument mayb that jack kennedi wa not __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ qualifi __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ as oppos to richard nixon __PUNCT__
the voter decid on jack kennedi __PUNCT__
so i can't dictat what the voter will decid __PUNCT__
all i can do is match my credenti and my knowledg and background up against senat obama or senat clinton __PUNCT__
that race is not decid yet __PUNCT__
and i will gladli stand not onli on that background and experi __PUNCT__ but my vision and my abil to lead thi countri in difficult time __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ you gave a major econom speech recent in which you said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ it not the duti of govern to bail out and reward those who act irrespons __PUNCT__ whether thei big bank or small borrow __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ wallac __PUNCT__ after that __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ on columnist compar you to mr __PUNCT__ potter __PUNCT__ the banker in __PUNCT__ it a wonder life __PUNCT__
what would you do to help the thousand of american who right now ar in the process of lose their home __PUNCT__ or do you feel __PUNCT__ as you said in your speech __PUNCT__ that not the duti of govern __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ american ar hurt right now __PUNCT__
american ar sit around the kitchen tabl as we speak try to keep the american dream __PUNCT__ and that is ownership of their own home __PUNCT__
thei don't know if thei have to get anoth job __PUNCT__
thei don't know if __PUNCT__ the challeng ar enorm right now __PUNCT__ and american ar hurt __PUNCT__
the kei to it is not to bail out peopl who specul or peopl who engag in unsavori practic __PUNCT__
the kei to it is get the lender and the borrow togeth __PUNCT__
we know how hard that is becaus of identifi the lender __PUNCT__ but there wai to do it __PUNCT__
the kei to it is to support thi legisl which is go through the senat right now which i think will move the ball forward down the field __PUNCT__ such as individu deduct for and larger deduct for home loan mortgag payment __PUNCT__ the purchas of mortgag which ar bad by local author __PUNCT__ increas fund for counsel so that peopl who ar in difficulti will better recogn what their option ar __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ there a role for govern __PUNCT__ but it not to __PUNCT__ it not to reward greedi specul __PUNCT__
it is not to reward peopl who misbehav __PUNCT__
and it certainli isn't a huge expenditur of taxpay __PUNCT__ dollar which __PUNCT__ in the long run __PUNCT__ could exacerb the problem that exist __PUNCT__
on the issu of bear stearn __PUNCT__ veri quickli __PUNCT__ everi financi expert i know sai that if it had fail __PUNCT__ it would have rippl throughout the entir financi commun and would have caus greater problem which eventu would have come down on the averag citizen if our economi continu to declin the wai that it been do __PUNCT__
so i readi to act __PUNCT__
and i understand how terribl thi is for so mani million of american famili __PUNCT__
and i understand the challeng and i prepar to meet them __PUNCT__ and that is limit govern intervent __PUNCT__
but where govern is requir __PUNCT__ let go ahead and do it __PUNCT__
we pass a stimulu packag __PUNCT__
peopl ar go to be get check in the month of mai __PUNCT__
mayb thei be abl to help boost the economi a littl bit __PUNCT__
but there no magic wand here that can be wave __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ let turn to foreign polici __PUNCT__
you acknowledg you were surpris by the recent iraqi offens in basra __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern fail to oust those shiit militia __PUNCT__
doesn't that rais seriou question about the continu weak of the central govern in baghdad __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ when i sai i wa surpris __PUNCT__ our author in iraq were surpris __PUNCT__ the state depart __PUNCT__ it wa about a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ hour __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
the whole govern wa surpris __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ about a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ hour window __PUNCT__
it interest __PUNCT__
we have ask the govern time after time to act effect __PUNCT__ that we want thi govern to act __PUNCT__
thei act __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ the result were mix __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ there were problem __PUNCT__
and maliki __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ should have wait until we had conclud the battl of mosul which is go on as we speak __PUNCT__
thei do have control of the port of basra now __PUNCT__
that on of the major econom area of iraq becaus of the oil that goe through there __PUNCT__
it wa al __PUNCT__ sadr that declar a ceas __PUNCT__ fire __PUNCT__ not maliki __PUNCT__ and thei continu __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ it wa broker by the iranian __PUNCT__ who actual mai have more clout with both al __PUNCT__ sadr __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ let me just ask you the question from thi point of view __PUNCT__
gener petraeu is come to testifi in the next coupl of dai __PUNCT__
a lot of talk about the surg and how that help damp down the violenc __PUNCT__ some would sai becaus there wa a spike of violenc dure thi basra battl __PUNCT__ mayb al __PUNCT__ sadr decis to hold the ceas __PUNCT__ fire is as respons as the surg is __PUNCT__ and if he chang hi mind __PUNCT__ we back in the fry pan __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ in respect __PUNCT__ i don't think sadr would have declar the ceas __PUNCT__ fire if he thought he wa win __PUNCT__
most time in histori of militari engag __PUNCT__ the win side doesn't declar the ceas __PUNCT__ fire __PUNCT__
the second point is that overal __PUNCT__ the iraqi militari perform pretti well __PUNCT__
six month ago __PUNCT__ it would have __PUNCT__ or eight or nine month ago __PUNCT__ it would have been unthink for maliki to act thi wai __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ we heard thi week that __NUM__ soldier refus to fight or desert __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ and there were mani __PUNCT__ mani thousand who ar fight there __PUNCT__
compar that with two year ago when the armi wa basic unabl to function in ani wai effect __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i didn't particularli like the outcom of thi thing __PUNCT__ but i am convinc that we now have a govern that is govern with some effect and a militari that is function veri effect __PUNCT__
up in mosul where some of the best unit ar __PUNCT__ thei function well __PUNCT__
i alwai said __PUNCT__ chri __PUNCT__ thi is long and hard and tough __PUNCT__
we pai a huge penalti for four year of a fail strategi that i fought hard against __PUNCT__ and i believ thi strategi ha succeed and will succe and can succe __PUNCT__
but it long and hard and tough __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ a coupl of final question i go to ask you __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__
you said thi week that you have start put togeth the list of possibl for vice presid __PUNCT__
given that you call radic islam the transcend challeng of our ag __PUNCT__ fair to assum that your run mate must have firsthand foreign polici experi __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i don't know if that __PUNCT__ i think that the person __PUNCT__ the first and realli major and overwhelm prioriti is a person who share my principl __PUNCT__ my valu __PUNCT__ my prioriti __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ prioriti ar veri import in presid __PUNCT__ and could immedi take my place __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ the overrid criteria __PUNCT__
wallac __PUNCT__ so it could be someon who __PUNCT__ in effect __PUNCT__ a foreign polici novic __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it could be someon who ha a lot of experi and someon who doesn't on nation secur issu __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ the process that we in __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it so earli in the process that __PUNCT__ honestli __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ the sole criteria i look at is not that __PUNCT__
it is who can best take my place and carri on the agenda and the vision that i have outlin and will continu to outlin dure thi campaign __PUNCT__
