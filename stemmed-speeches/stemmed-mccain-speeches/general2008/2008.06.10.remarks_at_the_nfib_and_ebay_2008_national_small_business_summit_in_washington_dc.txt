but i do know that more than anyth els __PUNCT__ small busi ar what make the american economi run __PUNCT__
you the on who take the risk __PUNCT__ often with littl start __PUNCT__ up monei and noth to fall back on __PUNCT__
you ar the on who do most of the innov in thi countri __PUNCT__ and most of the hire __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
for women __PUNCT__ for immigr and for peopl of everi background __PUNCT__ small busi ar the path to success and to the american dream __PUNCT__
in thi veri tough time for our economi and for worker and famili across our countri __PUNCT__ job creation among small busi is crucial __PUNCT__
the african __PUNCT__ american and the hispan __PUNCT__ american small busi commun ar on of the fastest grow segment of our economi __PUNCT__
that is a credit to the entrepreneur of america __PUNCT__ and america prosper depend on your success __PUNCT__
job creation is just on reason why the govern should never take the hard work __PUNCT__ sacrific __PUNCT__ and earn of small busi for grant __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ my goal will to get our economi run at full strength again __PUNCT__
and that start by support small busi across america __PUNCT__
now that we know who i will be face in the gener elect __PUNCT__ the real debat over econom polici can begin __PUNCT__
and as you mai have heard __PUNCT__ senat obama and i might well be meet soon in a seri of town hall discuss __PUNCT__
just the two of us __PUNCT__ in direct convers with voter __PUNCT__
no need to turn it into a big media __PUNCT__ run product with process question from report __PUNCT__ a spin room __PUNCT__ and all the rest of it __PUNCT__
to keep thing friendli __PUNCT__ i also suggest that my oppon and i travel to these town hall meet togeth in the same plane __PUNCT__
our disagr in these town hall meet will be civil and friendli __PUNCT__ but thei will also be clear for all to see __PUNCT__
on tax polici __PUNCT__ health __PUNCT__ care reform __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ govern spend __PUNCT__ and a long list of other issu __PUNCT__ we offer veri differ choic to the american peopl __PUNCT__
and those choic will have veri differ consequ for american worker and small busi owner __PUNCT__
no matter which of us win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ there will be chang in washington __PUNCT__
the question is what kind of chang __PUNCT__ will we enact the singl largest tax increas sinc the second world war as my oppon propos __PUNCT__ or will we keep tax low for famili and employ __PUNCT__ thi elect offer american a veri distinct choic about what kind of chang we will have __PUNCT__
thi is especi true for the small busi commun __PUNCT__
let me speak to you about the chang i will seek __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i intend to act quickli and decis to promot growth and opportun __PUNCT__
i intend to keep the current low incom and invest tax rate __PUNCT__
and i will pursu tax reform that support the wage __PUNCT__ earner and job creator who make thi economi run __PUNCT__ and help them to succe in a global economi __PUNCT__
seriou reform is need to help american compani compet in intern market __PUNCT__
i have propos a reduct in the corpor tax rate from the second highest in the world to on on par with our trade partner __PUNCT__ to keep busi and job in thi countri __PUNCT__
on of the most crucial econom issu in thi campaign is the abil of american worker to benefit from export to other nation __PUNCT__ and how govern polici can help them to do so __PUNCT__
and here __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ i welcom the debat with the democrat nomine __PUNCT__
i want to break down foreign trade barrier __PUNCT__ so that america small busi can compet abroad __PUNCT__
when new trade partner can sell in our market __PUNCT__ and american compani can sell in their __PUNCT__ the gain ar great and last __PUNCT__
the strength of the american economi offer a better life to everi societi we trade with __PUNCT__ and the good come back to us in mani wai __PUNCT__ in better job __PUNCT__ higher wage __PUNCT__ and lower price __PUNCT__
free trade can also give onc troubl and impoverish nation a stake in the world economi __PUNCT__ and in their relat with america __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we have to help displac worker at everi turn on a tough road __PUNCT__ so that thei ar not just spectat on the opportun of other __PUNCT__
and i have made that commit with reform to expand and improv feder aid to american worker in need __PUNCT__
we need to help million of worker who have lost a job that won't come back find a new on that won't go awai __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ senat obama ha a habit of talk down the valu of our export and trade agreement __PUNCT__
he even propos a unilater re __PUNCT__ negoti of nafta __PUNCT__ our agreement with canada and mexico that account for __NUM__ percent of american export __PUNCT__
but we have a sharp disagr here that i look forward to debat __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ thi countri will honor it intern agreement __PUNCT__ includ nafta __PUNCT__ and we will expect the same of other __PUNCT__
and in a time of uncertainti for american worker __PUNCT__ we will not undo the gain of year in trade agreement now await final approv __PUNCT__
and as we expand market for american product __PUNCT__ we must do more tax reform here at home __PUNCT__
i will propos and sign into law a reform to permit the first __PUNCT__ year expens of new equip and technolog __PUNCT__
we also go to keep the low rate on capit gain __PUNCT__ so that busi like your can expand and creat job instead of just send more of your earn to the govern __PUNCT__
and so parent can spend and save more for their own children __PUNCT__ i will propos to doubl the size of the child tax exempt __PUNCT__
i will also propos as well a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut __PUNCT__ a phase __PUNCT__ out of the altern minimum tax to save more than __NUM__ million middl __PUNCT__ class famili as much as __NUM__ dollar in a singl year __PUNCT__
anoth of my disagr with senat obama concern the estat tax __PUNCT__ which he propos to increas to a top rate of __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the estat tax is on of the most unfair tax law on the book __PUNCT__ and the first step to reform is to keep it predict and keep it low __PUNCT__
after a lifetim build up a busi __PUNCT__ and pai tax on everi dollar that busi earn __PUNCT__ that asset should not be subject to a confiscatori tax __PUNCT__
it is not enough __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ to make littl fix here and there in the tax code __PUNCT__ especi if you a small busi owner file under the individu tax __PUNCT__
what we need is a simpler __PUNCT__ a flatter __PUNCT__ and a fair tax code __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will propos an altern tax system __PUNCT__
when thi reform is enact __PUNCT__ all who wish to file under the current system could still do so __PUNCT__
and everyon els could choos a vastli less complic system with two tax rate and a gener standard deduct __PUNCT__
american do not resent pai their fair share of tax __PUNCT__
what thei do resent __PUNCT__ and especi if thei try to run a busi __PUNCT__ is be subject to thousand of page of needless and often irrat rule and demand from the ir __PUNCT__
we know from experi that no seriou reform of the current tax code will come out of congress __PUNCT__ so now it is time to turn the decis over to the peopl __PUNCT__
we ar go to creat a new and simpler tax system __PUNCT__ and give the american peopl a choic __PUNCT__
senat obama plan would add to the difficulti of small busi in other wai __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
current __PUNCT__ there ar the __NUM__ million sole proprietorship file under the individu incom tax __PUNCT__
when senat obama talk about rais incom tax rate on those make over __NUM__ dollar __PUNCT__ that includ these busi as well __PUNCT__
he also propos increas in dividend and capit gain tax __PUNCT__
under senat obama tax plan __PUNCT__ american of everi background would see their tax rise __PUNCT__ senior __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ small busi owner __PUNCT__ and just about everyon who ha even a modest invest in the market __PUNCT__
he propos to elimin the social secur earn cap __PUNCT__ and therebi to increas the tax on employ __PUNCT__
he propos to elimin the secret ballot for union vote __PUNCT__ and to rais the minimum wage and then index it __PUNCT__ which is a sure wai to add to your cost and to slow the creation of new job __PUNCT__
you work hard in small busi to grow and to creat new job and opportun for other __PUNCT__ and the feder govern shouldn't make your work ani harder __PUNCT__
as for health care polici __PUNCT__ i believ that the best wai to help small busi and employ afford health care is not to increas govern control of health care but to bring the rise cost of care under control and give peopl the option of have person __PUNCT__ portabl health insur __PUNCT__
as it is __PUNCT__ the tradit tax __PUNCT__ subsidi that support privat insur is concentr on a subset of american worker and a portion of our busi __PUNCT__
my health care reform will end that unfair bia in the law __PUNCT__ while help to make health insur more afford for everi american __PUNCT__
we go to offer everi individu and famili in america a larg tax credit to bui their health care __PUNCT__ so that their health insur is their to keep even when thei move or chang job __PUNCT__
my plan would allow those who want to stick with employ provid health insur to do so __PUNCT__
but i want to give individu greater choic __PUNCT__ rather than give small busi no choic at all __PUNCT__
for too long __PUNCT__ govern ha been the voic of big busi __PUNCT__ not small busi __PUNCT__
and to make matter wors __PUNCT__ even when veri larg busi violat their trust __PUNCT__ thei seem to be held to a differ standard __PUNCT__ get awai with conduct that would leav ani small busi owner broke __PUNCT__
we need rule that assur fair and punish wrongdo in the market __PUNCT__ and hold everi busi person in america to the same fair standard __PUNCT__
in time of hardship and distress __PUNCT__ we should be more vigil than ever in hold corpor abus to account __PUNCT__ as in the case of the hous market __PUNCT__
american ar right to be offend when the extravag salari and sever deal of ceo __PUNCT__ in some case __PUNCT__ the veri same ceo who help to bring on these market troubl __PUNCT__ bear no relat to the success of the compani or the wish of sharehold __PUNCT__
someth is serious wrong when the american peopl ar left to bear the consequ of reckless corpor conduct __PUNCT__ while the offend themselv ar pack off with anoth forti __PUNCT__ or fifti million for the road __PUNCT__
if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i intend to see that wrongdo of thi kind is call to account by feder prosecutor __PUNCT__
and under my reform __PUNCT__ all aspect of a ceo pai __PUNCT__ includ ani sever arrang __PUNCT__ must be approv by sharehold __PUNCT__
in so mani wai __PUNCT__ we need to make a clean break from the worst excess of both polit parti __PUNCT__
and for republican __PUNCT__ it start with reclaim our good name as the parti of spend restraint __PUNCT__
somewher along the wai __PUNCT__ too mani republican in congress becam indistinguish from the big __PUNCT__ spend democrat thei us to oppos __PUNCT__
the onli power of govern that could stop them wa the power of veto __PUNCT__ and it wa rare us __PUNCT__
if that author is entrust to me __PUNCT__ i will us the veto as need __PUNCT__
i will veto everi bill with earmark __PUNCT__
i will seek a constitution valid line __PUNCT__ item veto to end pork __PUNCT__ barrel spend onc and for all __PUNCT__
and i will lead broad reform that remov the mani corpor tax loophol that ar costli __PUNCT__ unfair to smaller busi competitor __PUNCT__ and inconsist with a free __PUNCT__ market economi __PUNCT__
the recent __NUM__ billion __PUNCT__ dollar farm bill wa a case in point __PUNCT__
famili farmer ar america origin small busi owner __PUNCT__ and mani ar struggl to surviv __PUNCT__
but nowadai __PUNCT__ small farmer have been forgotten __PUNCT__ and instead the congress send a steadi suppli of subsidi to agribusi __PUNCT__
it would be hard to find ani singl bill that better sum up why so mani american in both parti ar so disappoint in the conduct of their govern __PUNCT__ and at time so disgust by it __PUNCT__
even as american famili struggl to bui food __PUNCT__ becaus of rise price __PUNCT__ congress refus to place real limit on farm subsidi or end tariff on import that drive groceri bill higher __PUNCT__
when both parti carri on like thi __PUNCT__ there is onli on proper respons __PUNCT__ a presidenti veto __PUNCT__
that is exactli what i will do as presid __PUNCT__ with ani bill that serv onli special interest and corpor welfar __PUNCT__
on my watch there will be no more subsidi for special pleader __PUNCT__ no more corpor welfar __PUNCT__ no more throw around billion of dollar of the peopl monei on pet project __PUNCT__ while the peopl themselv ar struggl to afford their home __PUNCT__ groceri __PUNCT__ and ga __PUNCT__
we ar go to get our prioriti straight in washington __PUNCT__ a clean break from year of squander wealth and wast chanc __PUNCT__
to control spend __PUNCT__ i will also order a thorough review of the budget of everi feder program __PUNCT__ depart __PUNCT__ and agenc __PUNCT__ and i will post the result of these review on the internet for everi american to see __PUNCT__
while that review is underwai __PUNCT__ we will institut a on __PUNCT__ year paus in discretionari spend increas with the necessari exempt of militari spend and veteran benefit __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ discretionari spend __PUNCT__ is a term peopl throw around a lot in washington __PUNCT__ while actual discret is seldom exercis __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ everi program come with a built __PUNCT__ in assumpt that it should go on forev __PUNCT__ and it budget increas forev __PUNCT__
my administr will chang that wai of think __PUNCT__
we will ensur that feder spend serv the common interest __PUNCT__ that fail program ar not reward but reinvent or end __PUNCT__ and that discretionari spend is go where it belong __PUNCT__ to essenti prioriti like job train __PUNCT__ the secur of o ur citizen __PUNCT__ and the care of our veteran __PUNCT__
these ar among the mani seriou issu at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
all of these challeng __PUNCT__ and more __PUNCT__ will face the next presid __PUNCT__ and i will not leav them for some unlucki gener of leader to deal with __PUNCT__
for too long govern ha been more interest in protect it budget and it interest rather than the interest of small busi and the famili budget that depend on your growth __PUNCT__
and partisanship in washington is less focus on your futur than it is on the next elect __PUNCT__
my goal __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ is not to denigr govern but to make it better __PUNCT__ not to derid it but to restor it good name __PUNCT__
govern should be on your side __PUNCT__ not in your wai __PUNCT__
it will be hard work __PUNCT__ but it is a caus worthi of our best effort __PUNCT__
and if we do it well __PUNCT__ in the right spirit __PUNCT__ it will be becaus we have again put our countri interest befor the interest of parti __PUNCT__ bureaucraci and self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
and then we will final reclaim the confid of the peopl we serv __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
