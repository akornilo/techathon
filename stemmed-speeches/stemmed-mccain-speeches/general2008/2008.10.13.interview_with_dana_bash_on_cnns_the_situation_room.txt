when you hear someth like that __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ and that had a gop leader __PUNCT__
and i have repudi everi time there a statement about senat obama made that i felt wa inappropri and unfair __PUNCT__
you have peopl in polit campaign __PUNCT__ on the outermost fring on both end of the spectrum __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ a respect member of congress __PUNCT__ john lewi __PUNCT__ who i admir and have written about how much i admir __PUNCT__ somehow link me and governor palin to racism __PUNCT__ to segregation __PUNCT__ to some of the worst aspect ever to appear in american polit __PUNCT__
and senat obama refus or ha not yet repudi those comment __PUNCT__
that not from some quot parti offici __PUNCT__

and in that statement __PUNCT__ you said that you were concern that lewi and peopl like him were try to __PUNCT__ shut down debat __PUNCT__
what did you mean by that __PUNCT__ what do you think that thei try to do with regard to __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ the accus that congressman lewi made is so far out of bound and so disturb to me __PUNCT__ so of cours it top me in my track __PUNCT__
i never believ that john lewi __PUNCT__ who is an american hero __PUNCT__ who i admir __PUNCT__ would everi make a comment of that natur __PUNCT__
he even refer to the bomb of a church in birmingham __PUNCT__
that unaccept __PUNCT__
it total unaccept __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ i not go to accept it and i go to reject it __PUNCT__
bash __PUNCT__ when you sai shut down debat so you think it __PUNCT__ do you think that thei us race __PUNCT__ let get __PUNCT__ let have some straight talk __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__

mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ when anybodi sai anyth like that __PUNCT__ that is so behind the pale __PUNCT__ that it stun me __PUNCT__
