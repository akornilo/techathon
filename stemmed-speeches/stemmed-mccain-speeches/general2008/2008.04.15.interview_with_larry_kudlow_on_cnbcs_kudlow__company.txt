it is not tax that ar insuffici __PUNCT__ it spend that out of control __PUNCT__
and on of the area i would go after first and hardest is defens acquisit __PUNCT__

that becaus we distort the market __PUNCT__
i for biofuel __PUNCT__ i for all that stuff __PUNCT__ but let let the market plai __PUNCT__

kudlow __PUNCT__ come back to thi summer ga tax holidai that you unveil in your speech todai __PUNCT__
it a pretti interest point __PUNCT__
i don't think anybodi talk about anyth like that __PUNCT__
let me just ask you __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ you been veri tough on the issu of carbon emiss __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you waiv the ga tax __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ __URL__ motorist __PUNCT__ isn't that go to actual spur gasolin consumpt and increas carbon emiss __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i love to tell you that would happen __PUNCT__
we talk about __NUM__ cent a gallon for regular fuel and __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ __NUM__ cent for diesel __PUNCT__
i not sure that it stimul it __PUNCT__
i think it eas the burden __PUNCT__
the peopl that drive the furthest in america ar the lowest incom peopl __PUNCT__
you spent enough time in washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__ to know that the wealthiest live in georgetown and can almost walk to work __PUNCT__ the least wealthi live the furthest awai and drive mani __PUNCT__ mani mile __PUNCT__
i think that there __PUNCT__ that it is a disproportion burden on low incom american that don't have access to mass transport __PUNCT__ that have to go a long wai to work __PUNCT__
but i like to see american get some relief thi summer and mayb feel a littl better __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ and i think it be a nice thing to do __PUNCT__ a good thing to do __PUNCT__ includ suspend further purchas of oil __PUNCT__ of ga and oil for __PUNCT__ of oil for the strateg petroleum reserv __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ some peopl have look at thi propos thi morn __PUNCT__ which i said is a novel propos __PUNCT__ and thei said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ __URL__ thi go to provid __PUNCT__ ultim __PUNCT__ more revenu for saudi arabia and opec __PUNCT__ which is the revers of what you have argu for in the past __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i do not believ that we can continu our effort to altern fuel and altern energi sourc __PUNCT__ includ nuclear __PUNCT__ which is vital __PUNCT__ and still give american a littl bit of relief and let them afford a vacat thi summer __PUNCT__
so all i can tell you is i like to give american some relief and it will have littl or no impact of ani kind on our overal effort that we must mount to becom energi independ __PUNCT__ and that ha to do with a lot of altern energi __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ and i emphas nuclear __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
a month ago on the hous and the mortgag issu __PUNCT__ you gave a strong speech and you said on of your core principl __PUNCT__ it is not the duti of govern to bail out and reward those who act irrespons __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ yep __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ last week in brooklyn __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__ you unveil your home plan __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ __URL__ is essenti a widespread fha assist program not unlik what obama and hillari ar sai __PUNCT__
why the switch __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ i said that we should not reward peopl who have __PUNCT__ who have act in an unscrupul fashion __PUNCT__ and thi doesn't __PUNCT__ thi is target at as mani as __NUM__ homeown who had a legitim home mortgag __PUNCT__ thei __PUNCT__ it their primari resid and all the __PUNCT__ all of a sudden thei find themselv unabl to make the payment __PUNCT__
these peopl ar not the on i wa talk about then __PUNCT__
there ha been no switch __PUNCT__
i said at that time i want to help peopl who need the help __PUNCT__ who ar deserv of it __PUNCT__
and these peopl ar deserv of it __PUNCT__ who ar in their primari resid __PUNCT__ who ar elig to have a mortgag that thei can afford __PUNCT__
and it in the lender interest as well as the borrow interest __PUNCT__ otherwis __PUNCT__ that home becom vacant __PUNCT__
and in the event __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ in the event of sale of that home __PUNCT__ over time with appreci __PUNCT__ on third would go to the lender __PUNCT__ on third to the fha and on third to the homeown __PUNCT__
so i think it a __PUNCT__ it a veri badli need relief to honest __PUNCT__ legitim __PUNCT__ home __PUNCT__ own american who find themselv trap in thi terribl problem of own __PUNCT__ of realiz __PUNCT__ not be abl to realiz the american dream __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ doe your version of thi differ from the democrat version __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i haven't read their version __PUNCT__ but from what i understand their is veri massiv and veri expens __PUNCT__
but i haven't read their __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ would you consid __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ roll back the commun reinvest act __PUNCT__ which a lot of peopl sai trigger thi __PUNCT__ mandat bank and other lender to make substandard loan in the first place __PUNCT__ and the creator of the subprim mortgag back in the middl __PUNCT__ 90 __PUNCT__ is it time to take a look at the commun reinvest act __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
there were peopl who predict that the commun reinvest act might lead to reckless and unsound lend practic just to sort of fill a __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a amount of __PUNCT__ i don't like to us the word __PUNCT__ quota __PUNCT__ but certain percentag of a __PUNCT__ of a home __PUNCT__ of the bank lend practic __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ it ha to be re __PUNCT__ examin __PUNCT__ it ha to be judg by it effect __PUNCT__ and we need to find out how thi particular system affect the overal insolv of the subprim lend issu __PUNCT__
and i think it __PUNCT__ i not sai it need to be repeal __PUNCT__ but it certainli need to be re __PUNCT__ examin and what it effect have been __PUNCT__
and we be abl to figur that out __PUNCT__
kudlow __PUNCT__ just on last on __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__

former fed chairman paul volcker the other dai in new york said we ar in a dollar crisi __PUNCT__
would you support or would you recommend a fed/treasury/g7 action to defend the dollar and to strengthen the dollar as a wai of hold down these inflationari pressur __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__ i certainli would give it everi consider __PUNCT__ but you and i both know that a weak dollar is a symptom of fundament problem __PUNCT__ such as our trade deficit __PUNCT__ half of it be account for by our need to import foreign oil __PUNCT__ our debt to the __PUNCT__ to the chines __PUNCT__ the spend practic __PUNCT__ our continu burgeon out of control behavior in washington which then ha given us an unsound economi __PUNCT__ reflect in the weaken dollar __PUNCT__
