thank you __PUNCT__
it is a pleasur to be here __PUNCT__
i want to keep my remark brief so that i can quickli get to your question __PUNCT__ comment or insult __PUNCT__
let me begin by offer a few thought about the press role in polit campaign __PUNCT__
long ago in my career __PUNCT__ i made a decis to be as access to the press as the press would prefer me to be __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ perhap __PUNCT__ even more than thei would prefer __PUNCT__
there have been dai on the back of the bu when i couldn't help but notic the relief that spread among report when __PUNCT__ after hour had pass __PUNCT__ our convers exhaust the dai question of polici and polit and final turn to ball score __PUNCT__ vacat plan __PUNCT__ and the amus eat and sleep habit of my friend __PUNCT__ lindsei graham __PUNCT__
for those of you interest in what those habit might entail __PUNCT__ liz sidoti __PUNCT__ libbi quaid and dave espo can fill you in __PUNCT__
run campaign under the frequent if not constant scrutini of the press can be challeng __PUNCT__
and there have been dai when i wish you had been somewher els when i made comment that were interpret in wai i didn't intend and took on a longer life than i would have prefer __PUNCT__
occasion __PUNCT__ the penalti a candid suffer by grant widespread access can reinforc a campaign natur tendenc to avoid risk and close control it messag __PUNCT__
there have been time when my enthusiasm in argu a point and my glib have had an effect that caus me to appreci the qualiti of tight messag disciplin and my staff to becom distraught becaus i answer a question simpli becaus i wa ask __PUNCT__
i confess also that on occas __PUNCT__ perhap mani occas __PUNCT__ i have felt report __PUNCT__ question __PUNCT__ their redund and sometim adversari qualiti __PUNCT__ were intend more at produc candid fatigu and __PUNCT__ consequ __PUNCT__ mistak than the enlighten of your reader __PUNCT__
these aren't trivial worri __PUNCT__ and thei do tend to support argument for a more care approach to talk to you __PUNCT__
i want to win thi elect as do my oppon __PUNCT__ and american have alwai taken the view that the shortest distanc between two point is a straight line __PUNCT__
thu __PUNCT__ campaign natur look suspici at the more circuit rout to success that wend and sometim lose it wai through the obstacl cours of the candid exchang with the press __PUNCT__
but i becom rather accustom to it __PUNCT__
and though my campaign certainli took a circuit rout to secur my parti nomin __PUNCT__ to put it charit __PUNCT__ i don't intend to chang that particular habit of a lifetim __PUNCT__
i believ in give great access to the press for three reason __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i much prefer long back and forth __PUNCT__ where report have multipl follow up and i have an opportun to explain my view in greater detail __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ occasion to correct ani initi mistak i might have made in commun them __PUNCT__ than is allow in the short exchang and bright light of the press avail __PUNCT__
the dynam of the avail __PUNCT__ in my opinion __PUNCT__ tend to produc more heat than light on your part and excess caution on the candid part __PUNCT__
report have on __PUNCT__ mayb two shot at me __PUNCT__ and thei want it to count __PUNCT__ by which i mean thei would like to catch me in a mistak __PUNCT__ a discrep or a less than art express __PUNCT__
and candid tend to approach them with the primari intent of not sai anyth beyond a singl messag or not sai anyth newsworthi at all __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i think report ar better abl to meet their first respons of ensur an inform citizenri if thei ar allow to press a candid for more than a gotcha quot or a comment on whatev the cabl driven new environ ha decid is the process stori of the dai __PUNCT__
last __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ the respons of an inform citizenri is as much my respons as it is your __PUNCT__
i don't believ in deceiv voter about my posit __PUNCT__ my belief or how i would govern thi countri were i to have the extraordinari privileg of serv as presid __PUNCT__
i want voter to know and understand my posit __PUNCT__
i intend to stand by them __PUNCT__ to defend them and even __PUNCT__ at time __PUNCT__ to engag in spirit debat with voter about them __PUNCT__
but i want them to know what and why i believ the thing i believ __PUNCT__
and i think the press want voter to know that as well __PUNCT__ even though __PUNCT__ at time __PUNCT__ my view can suffer from your translat of them __PUNCT__ sometim more through my fault than your __PUNCT__
that is why i prefer the townhal format to other form of commun with the voter __PUNCT__
and that is why i make myself regularli avail to all of you __PUNCT__
i will screw up sometim __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ so will you __PUNCT__
but on the whole __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ i and __PUNCT__ most importantli __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar better serv by the open and account that direct __PUNCT__ lengthi and frequent exchang with the press produc __PUNCT__
and i will take my chanc with you and trust in the american peopl to get it right in the end __PUNCT__
in the spirit of that commit to commun my view fulli and honestli to you __PUNCT__ i want to address quickli an issu i know is import to you __PUNCT__ the so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ shield law __PUNCT__ pend befor congress __PUNCT__
i have had a hard time decid whether to support or oppos it __PUNCT__
to be veri candid __PUNCT__ but with no wish to offend you __PUNCT__ i must confess there have been time when i worri that the press __PUNCT__ interest in get a scoop occasion conflict with other import prioriti __PUNCT__ even the first concern of everi american __PUNCT__ the secur of our nation __PUNCT__
i take a veri __PUNCT__ veri dim view of stori that disclos classifi inform that unnecessarili threaten or make it more difficult to protect the physic secur of american __PUNCT__
i think that ha happen befor __PUNCT__ rare __PUNCT__ but it ha happen __PUNCT__
i think the new york time __PUNCT__ decis to disclos surveil program to monitor the convers of peopl who wish to do us harm came too close to cross that line __PUNCT__
and i understand complet why the govern charg with defend our secur would want to discourag that from happen and hold the peopl who disclos that damag inform account for their action __PUNCT__
the shield law would give great licens to you and your sourc __PUNCT__ with few restrict __PUNCT__ to do as you pleas no matter the stake involv and without fear of person consequ beyond the rebuk of your individu conscienc __PUNCT__
it is __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ a licens to do harm __PUNCT__ perhap seriou harm __PUNCT__
but it also a licens to do good __PUNCT__ to disclos injustic and unlaw and inequ __PUNCT__ and to encourag their swift correct __PUNCT__
the first amend is base in that recognit __PUNCT__ and i am __PUNCT__ despit the critic of campaign financ reform oppon __PUNCT__ commit to that essenti right of a free societi __PUNCT__
i know that the press that disclos secur secret that should have remain so also reveal the disgrac of abu ghraib __PUNCT__ a disgrac that made it much harder to protect the american peopl from harm __PUNCT__
thu __PUNCT__ despit concern i have about the legisl __PUNCT__ i have narrowli decid to support it __PUNCT__
i respect those of my colleagu who have decid not to __PUNCT__ appreci veri much the concern that have inform their posit __PUNCT__ and encourag further negoti to address those concern __PUNCT__
but if the vote were held todai __PUNCT__ i would vote ye __PUNCT__
by so do __PUNCT__ i and other __PUNCT__ on behalf of the peopl we repres __PUNCT__ ar will to invest in the press a veri solemn trust that in the us of confidenti sourc you will not do more harm than good whether it come to the secur of the nation or the reput of good peopl __PUNCT__
no profess alwai meet it respons or alwai meet them perfectli __PUNCT__
certainli not mine __PUNCT__ and not your either __PUNCT__
there will be time __PUNCT__ i suspect __PUNCT__ when i will wonder again if i should have support thi measur __PUNCT__
but i trust in your integr and patriot that those occas won't be so numer that i will __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ deepli regret my decis __PUNCT__
and i would hope that when you do someth controversi or someth that mani peopl find wrong and harm you would explain fulli and honestli how and why you did it __PUNCT__ and confess your mistak __PUNCT__ if you made them __PUNCT__ in a more notic wai than afford by the small print on a correct page __PUNCT__
in truth __PUNCT__ the work of american newsroom ar some of the least transpar enterpris in the countri __PUNCT__ and it is easi to believ that the press ha on set of standard for govern __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and other institut __PUNCT__ and entir anoth for themselv __PUNCT__
and if you don't mind a littl construct cri ticism from someon who respect you __PUNCT__ i think that is an impress the press should work on correct __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ befor i take your question __PUNCT__ i would like to respond briefli to the comment on of my oppon made the other dai about the psycholog and polit mindset of american live in small town and other area that have experienc the loss of industri job __PUNCT__
dure the great depress __PUNCT__ with mani million of american out of work and the countri suffer the worst econom crisi in our histori __PUNCT__ there rose from small town __PUNCT__ rural commun __PUNCT__ inner citi __PUNCT__ a gener of american who fought to save the world from despot and mass murder __PUNCT__ and came home to build the wealthiest __PUNCT__ strongest and most gener nation on earth __PUNCT__
thei were not born with the advantag other in our countri enjoi __PUNCT__
thei suffer the worst dure the depress __PUNCT__
but it had not shaken their faith in and fidel to america and it found polit ideal __PUNCT__
nor had it destroi their confid that america and their own live could be made better __PUNCT__
nor did thei turn to their religi faith and cultur tradit out of resent and a feel of powerless to affect the cours of govern or pursu prosper __PUNCT__
on the contrari __PUNCT__ their faith had given gener of their famili purpos and mean __PUNCT__ as it doe todai __PUNCT__
and their appreci of tradit like hunt wa base in noth other than their contribut to the enjoy of life __PUNCT__
in my other profess and the war i serv in __PUNCT__ the countri reli overwhelmingli on american from these same commun to defend us __PUNCT__

thei never forgot who thei were __PUNCT__ where thei came from __PUNCT__ and what is possibl in america __PUNCT__ a countri found on an idea and not on class __PUNCT__ ethnic or sectarian ident __PUNCT__
and america must not and will not forget them __PUNCT__
next week __PUNCT__ i begin a tour of place in america that do not frequent see a candid for presid __PUNCT__
thei ar place far remov from the prosper that is enjoi elsewher in america __PUNCT__
i want to tell peopl live there that there must not be ani forgotten part of america __PUNCT__ ani forgotten american __PUNCT__
hope in america is not base in delus __PUNCT__ but in the faith that everyth is possibl in america __PUNCT__
the time for pander and fals promis is over __PUNCT__
it is time for action __PUNCT__
it is time for chang __PUNCT__ but the right kind of chang __PUNCT__ chang that trust in the strength of free peopl and free market __PUNCT__ chang that doesn't return to polici that empow govern to make our choic for us __PUNCT__ but that work to ensur that we have choic to make for ourselv __PUNCT__
for we have alwai trust american to build from the choic thei make for themselv __PUNCT__ a safer __PUNCT__ stronger and more prosper countri than the on thei inherit __PUNCT__
