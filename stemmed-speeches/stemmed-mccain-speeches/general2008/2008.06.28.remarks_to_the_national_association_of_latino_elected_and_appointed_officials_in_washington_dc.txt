thank you __PUNCT__
it good to be with you __PUNCT__
i want to speak veri briefli __PUNCT__ and then take your question __PUNCT__
i have the privileg todai of speak befor my oppon __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ whose talent as an orat __PUNCT__ as you might notic __PUNCT__ is somewhat greater than mine __PUNCT__
i will not overemphas that fact by indulg your patienc with a lengthi speech __PUNCT__
fortun for me and you __PUNCT__ i enjoi listen and respond to my audienc question more than i do deliv formal remark __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i want to share just a few thought with you __PUNCT__ and then move quickli to your question __PUNCT__ comment or insult __PUNCT__
we meet after anoth week of rise gasolin price __PUNCT__ anoth stock market sell __PUNCT__ off __PUNCT__ more mortgag foreclosur and the increas loss of the american peopl confid in the economi __PUNCT__
the question of how govern should respond to these troubl develop will shape much of the debat in thi elect __PUNCT__ and i want to offer a few thought about what i believ we should do and not do __PUNCT__
it is a terribl mistak to rais tax dure an econom downturn __PUNCT__
increas the tax burden on american imped job growth __PUNCT__ discourag innov and make us less competit __PUNCT__
small busi ar the biggest job creator in our economi __PUNCT__
keep individu tax rate low isn't intend as a favor to wealthi american __PUNCT__
most small busi owner pai those rate __PUNCT__ and take more monei from them depriv them of the capit thei need to invest and grow and hire __PUNCT__
there ar two million latino own busi in america __PUNCT__ a number that is grow veri rapidli __PUNCT__
the first consider we should have when debat tax polici is how we can help those compani grow and increas the prosper of the million of american famili whose econom secur depend on their success __PUNCT__
govern should be on their side __PUNCT__ not in their wai __PUNCT__
our current busi tax rate __PUNCT__ the second highest in the world __PUNCT__ will postpon our recoveri from thi downturn and make us increasingli less competit in the world economi __PUNCT__
when a corpor plan to expand and hire more worker __PUNCT__ thei face a choic between build a new plant here at home and build it in a countri like ireland where thei will pai less than half the tax rate thei now pai __PUNCT__
employ can hire more peopl __PUNCT__ or thei can pai more tax __PUNCT__
we can no longer afford the luxuri of nostalgia for past time when american busi face littl seriou competit in the world __PUNCT__
the global economi is here to stai __PUNCT__
we cannot build wall to foreign competit __PUNCT__ and why should we want to __PUNCT__
when have american ever been afraid of competit __PUNCT__ america is the biggest export __PUNCT__ import __PUNCT__ produc __PUNCT__ saver __PUNCT__ investor __PUNCT__ manufactur __PUNCT__ and innov in the world __PUNCT__
american don't run from the challeng of a global economi __PUNCT__
the courag __PUNCT__ patriot __PUNCT__ ingenu and industri of our forbear earn the rever we hold for our stori past __PUNCT__
but we have never been a countri that substitut nostalgia for optim __PUNCT__
we have never been a countri that would rather go back than forward __PUNCT__
we ar the world leader __PUNCT__ and leader don't fear chang __PUNCT__ hide from challeng __PUNCT__ pine for the past and dread the futur __PUNCT__
we make the futur better than the past __PUNCT__
that why i reject the fals virtu of econom isolation __PUNCT__
ani confid __PUNCT__ compet govern should embrac competit __PUNCT__ it make us stronger __PUNCT__ not hide from our competitor a nd cheat our consum and worker __PUNCT__
we can compet and win __PUNCT__ as we alwai have __PUNCT__ or we can be left behind __PUNCT__
lower barrier to trade creat more and better job __PUNCT__ and higher wage __PUNCT__
it keep inflat under control and interest rate low __PUNCT__
it make good more afford for low and middl incom consum __PUNCT__
protection threaten all those benefit __PUNCT__
open new market for american good and servic is indispens to our futur prosper __PUNCT__
but in the global economi what you learn is what you earn __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ half of latino and half of african american enter high school will never graduat __PUNCT__
by the __NUM__ grade __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ student in math and scienc score near the bottom of all industri nation __PUNCT__
as bill gate said __PUNCT__ thi isn't an accid or flaw in the system __PUNCT__
it is the system __PUNCT__
mani parent fear their children won't have the same opportun thei had __PUNCT__
that is simpli unaccept in a countri as great as our __PUNCT__
in mani school __PUNCT__ particularli where peopl ar struggl the hardest __PUNCT__ the situat is dire __PUNCT__ and i believ pose the civil right challeng of our time __PUNCT__
we need to shake up fail school bureaucraci with competit __PUNCT__ hold school account for result __PUNCT__ strengthen math __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ technolog and engin curriculum __PUNCT__ empow parent with choic __PUNCT__ remov barrier to qualifi instructor __PUNCT__ attract and reward superior teacher __PUNCT__ and have a fair but sure process to weed out incompet __PUNCT__
i have spent the last two week address the problem that is caus american the most pain right now __PUNCT__ our depend on import oil __PUNCT__ and how to free ourselv from a situat that threaten our economi __PUNCT__ our environ and our nation secur __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ the crisi most acut affect lower incom american __PUNCT__ who often drive the furthest to work and own the oldest car __PUNCT__
there ar a few __PUNCT__ but not mani __PUNCT__ thing we can do in the short term to allevi the econom distress american ar feel as thei pai more and more of their incom for gasolin __PUNCT__ and higher price for groceri and almost all good that ar affect by spiral increas in the price of oil __PUNCT__
but we must commit ourselv to address thi problem as quickli as humanli possibl __PUNCT__ and we must commit thi countri to the great nation caus of break our strateg depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
to do that __PUNCT__ we must address both the suppli and demand side o f the problem __PUNCT__
we must produc more oil at home __PUNCT__ and while explor and product will take some time __PUNCT__ it will have an earlier effect on the oil futur market __PUNCT__
when futur trader believ the suppli of oil will increas in the year ahead and the cost of a barrel of oil will be lower __PUNCT__ it will help curb some of the specul in those market that ar drive price so much higher todai __PUNCT__
but the last solut to all the problem associ with our depend on foreign oil is to begin in the term of the next presid the most ambiti program ever to reduc our demand for the fuel that is a power inflationari forc in our economi __PUNCT__ is caus our climat to chang with all the unimagin problem that creat __PUNCT__ and is ransom our futur to regim that care littl for our valu or our secur __PUNCT__
we need to unleash the competit forc of the free market to encourag clean altern __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ tide __PUNCT__ nuclear __PUNCT__ and clean coal __PUNCT__
but to realli achiev energi secur __PUNCT__ we must address the area where the demand for oil is the greatest the wai we fuel our transport system __PUNCT__
i have promis a plan __PUNCT__ which i call the lexington project __PUNCT__ for the place where america war for independ began __PUNCT__ which will encourag the invest and innov necessari to wean our car __PUNCT__ buse __PUNCT__ and truck off of our complet depend on gasolin __PUNCT__
thi will take time __PUNCT__ but the longer we wait to begin __PUNCT__ the longer it will take to achiev __PUNCT__
it is an ambiti plan __PUNCT__ but i am confid that our industri and entrepreneur __PUNCT__ and all american ar up to thi next great challeng in our histori __PUNCT__
the geniu __PUNCT__ hard work and courag of american have never fail us __PUNCT__ and will not fail us now __PUNCT__
let me close by talk briefli about my respect and gratitud for the contribut of hispan __PUNCT__ american to the cultur __PUNCT__ economi and secur of the countri i have serv all my adult life __PUNCT__
i repres arizona where spanish wa spoken befor english wa __PUNCT__ and where the charact and prosper of our state ow a great deal to the mani arizonan of hispan descent who live there __PUNCT__
and i know thi countri __PUNCT__ which i love more than almost anyth __PUNCT__ would be the poorer were we depriv of the patriot __PUNCT__ industri and decenc of those million of american whose famili came here from mexico __PUNCT__ central and south america __PUNCT__
i will honor their contribut to america for as long as i live __PUNCT__
i and mani other colleagu twice attempt to pass comprehens immigr legisl to fix our broken border __PUNCT__ ensur respect for the law of thi countri __PUNCT__ recogn the import econom necess of immigr labor __PUNCT__ apprehend those who came here illeg to commit crime __PUNCT__ and deal practic and human with those who came here __PUNCT__ as my distant ancestor did __PUNCT__ to build a better __PUNCT__ safer life for their famili __PUNCT__ without excus the fact thei came here illeg or grant them privileg befor those who did __PUNCT__
mani american __PUNCT__ with good caus __PUNCT__ did not believ us when we said we would secur our border __PUNCT__ and so we fail in our effort __PUNCT__
we must prove to them that we can and will secur our border first __PUNCT__ while respect the digniti and right of citizen and legal resid of the unit state __PUNCT__
but we must not make the mistak of think that our respons to meet thi challeng will end with that accomplish ment __PUNCT__
we have econom and humanitarian respons as well __PUNCT__ and thei requir no less dedic from us in meet them __PUNCT__
when i wa in prison in vietnam __PUNCT__ i like other of my fellow pow __PUNCT__ wa offer earli releas by my captor __PUNCT__
most of us refus becaus we were bound to our code of conduct __PUNCT__ which said those who had been captur the earliest had to be releas the soonest __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ everett alvarez __PUNCT__ a brave american of mexican descent __PUNCT__ had been shot down year befor i wa __PUNCT__ and had suffer for hi countri much more and much longer than i had __PUNCT__
to leav him behind would have shame us __PUNCT__
when you take the solemn stroll along that wall of black granit on the nation mall __PUNCT__ it is hard not to notic the mani name such as rodriguez __PUNCT__ hernandez __PUNCT__ and lopez that so sadli adorn it __PUNCT__
when you visit iraq and afghanistan you will meet some of the thousand of hispan __PUNCT__ american who serv there __PUNCT__ and mani of those who risk their live to protect the rest of us do not yet possess the right and privileg of full citizenship in the countri thei love so well __PUNCT__
to love your countri __PUNCT__ as i discov in vietnam __PUNCT__ is to love your countrymen __PUNCT__
those men and women ar my brother and sister __PUNCT__ my fellow american __PUNCT__ an associ that mean more to me than ani other __PUNCT__
as a privat citizen or as your presid __PUNCT__ i will never __PUNCT__ never do anyth to dishonor our oblig to them and their famili or to forget what thei and their ancestor have done to make thi countri the beauti __PUNCT__ bounti __PUNCT__ bless place we love __PUNCT__
