a littl more than three year ago __PUNCT__ i gave a speech here in new hampshir i call __PUNCT__ in defens of optim __PUNCT__
some of you probabl wonder if i could give a similar speech todai __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ a lot ha happen sinc then __PUNCT__ and a lot of it hasn't been good __PUNCT__ the escal of the war in iraq __PUNCT__ the aftermath of katrina __PUNCT__ health care cost rise __PUNCT__ incom stai flat __PUNCT__ mount evid of global warm __PUNCT__
i could go on __PUNCT__
but as a matter of fact __PUNCT__ i am still optimist __PUNCT__ mayb even more so than i wa then __PUNCT__
i am still optimist that america can be a countri where anyon who work hard is abl to get ahead and creat a good life for their famili __PUNCT__
i am optimist that we can restor america moral author __PUNCT__
the challeng mai be larger __PUNCT__ and we mai have even more work to do to build a countri that live up to our ideal and our potenti __PUNCT__
but we can do it __PUNCT__
i am optimist we can do these thing becaus my own life sai it is possibl __PUNCT__
i am optimist we can do these thing becaus everyth i love about america and our entrepreneuri spirit and sens of decenc sai it possibl __PUNCT__
but most of all __PUNCT__ i am optimist becaus of you and the million of peopl like you __PUNCT__
you don't have to look veri far or dig veri deep to find peopl determin to make the chang we need __PUNCT__
million of peopl ar impati to take control of their own live and to take the respons to get our countri back on track __PUNCT__
million of peopl who know we can't just wait for the next presid to come in and fix all of our problem or for govern to do what need to be done __PUNCT__
million of peopl who know that america is so much more than just a place __PUNCT__ america is an idea __PUNCT__
and the idea of america __PUNCT__ real __PUNCT__ fundament equal __PUNCT__ equal of opportun __PUNCT__ equal of cultur __PUNCT__ equal of respect __PUNCT__ equal for all __PUNCT__ matter more than ever __PUNCT__
our job is to make the idea of america real for all american __PUNCT__ and to rekindl that idea around the world __PUNCT__
so i want to take a few minut todai to talk about some of the challeng we face __PUNCT__
but i want to spend most of my time talk about the opportun befor us if we have the courag to do what it take __PUNCT__
becaus we have not yet realiz the promis of america __PUNCT__ we still struggl to live up to the idea __PUNCT__
there ar still two america here at home __PUNCT__ on for the power and anoth on for everyon els __PUNCT__
and there ar two america in the world __PUNCT__ the america that we aspir to and ha been a light to the world __PUNCT__ and the on you seen too often on the new late __PUNCT__
here at home __PUNCT__ the countri with the most advanc health care in the world __PUNCT__ we have more american without health care __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ not fewer __PUNCT__
in the richest countri in the histori of the globe __PUNCT__ we have more millionair and more billionair that ever __PUNCT__ but we also have more american live in poverti __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million peopl unabl to fulfil their basic need of food and shelter __PUNCT__ no matter how mani job thei work __PUNCT__ not less __PUNCT__
as someon who grew up in the segreg south it hurt me to sai that more than __NUM__ year after the brown decis __PUNCT__ we still have two school system __PUNCT__ on for peopl who live in the right neighborhood and on for everyon els __PUNCT__
and the truth is that opportun is too often deni to peopl becaus of the color of their skin __PUNCT__ their ethnic background __PUNCT__ their gender __PUNCT__ or their sexual prefer __PUNCT__
and you all know that we ar not lead the world in a wai that live up to the idea of america __PUNCT__ or is good for us here at home __PUNCT__
what we us to call foreign polici ha such a profound effect on our everydai live that there realli is no such thing as pure foreign polici anymor __PUNCT__
trade polici affect job and wage here and throughout the world __PUNCT__
energi polici affect climat chang here and all over the world __PUNCT__ and it impact domest and foreign secur __PUNCT__
poverti is an issu for us here __PUNCT__ i could talk about that all dai long __PUNCT__ but poverti is also an issu directli relat to the rise of terror and our place in the world economi __PUNCT__
a well __PUNCT__ known politician from a neighbor state us to sai that all polit is local __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ all polici is local __PUNCT__
we ar not go to solv these problem with the usual approach __PUNCT__
these challeng ar too big __PUNCT__ too connect __PUNCT__ and too complic to be answer with the same old polit of increment __PUNCT__
meet them requir more than just a new presid __PUNCT__ it requir an entir new approach __PUNCT__
to build the america we believ in requir fundament __PUNCT__ transform chang __PUNCT__
not chang for the sake of chang __PUNCT__ but chang for the sake of get to where we know the countri and the world can be __PUNCT__ should be __PUNCT__ and need to be __PUNCT__
not increment __PUNCT__ babi __PUNCT__ step chang __PUNCT__ but invigor __PUNCT__ uplift __PUNCT__ challeng __PUNCT__ dare __PUNCT__ boundari __PUNCT__ push chang that address the root caus and understand the complex of our challeng __PUNCT__
so if we ar go to lead from thi point in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we must lead with a bold and confid step __PUNCT__ confid in the great of the american idea __PUNCT__ and bold in our plan to make it real __PUNCT__
to lead the world in address the challeng of our centuri __PUNCT__ america must restor our moral author __PUNCT__
restor our moral author isn't just about feel good about ourselv __PUNCT__
when the world look to america for leadership __PUNCT__ we ar stronger and safer __PUNCT__ and so is the rest of the world __PUNCT__
restor our moral author mean lead by exampl __PUNCT__ and make clear that hard challeng don't frighten us __PUNCT__ but call us to action __PUNCT__
to me __PUNCT__ there is no better opportun to make thi clear than the enorm challeng of help the __NUM__ million american who live in poverti __PUNCT__
mayb you heard the phrase __PUNCT__ it expens to be poor __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ it also expens for america to have so mani poor __PUNCT__
we all pai a price when young peopl who could somedai find the cure for aid or make a fuel cell work ar sit on a stoop becaus thei didn't get the educ thei need __PUNCT__
and don't think for a second that address poverti is chariti __PUNCT__ address poverti make our workforc stronger and our economi stronger __PUNCT__
that is why i set a nation goal of elimin poverti in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and laid out a detail plan to do it by creat what i call a __PUNCT__ work societi __PUNCT__ build on what we learn to creat solut for the futur __PUNCT__
in a work societi __PUNCT__ we will reward work with a higher minimum wage __PUNCT__ stronger labor law __PUNCT__ and tax credit for work famili __PUNCT__
we will offer afford hous near good job and good school __PUNCT__ and creat a million step __PUNCT__ stone job for peopl who cannot find work on their own __PUNCT__
we will help worker save for the futur with new work bond and homeownership tax credit __PUNCT__
and we will all take respons for the problem of poverti and not just leav it to govern __PUNCT__
by build a work societi __PUNCT__ we won't just try the old solut and the old polit __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we will work __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__ to chang fundament the cultur of poverti itself and creat the condit that allow peopl to lift themselv up into the middl class __PUNCT__
rebuild our middl class for the __NUM__ centuri also mean get at the root of on of the main obstacl to middl class prosper __PUNCT__ the cost of health care __PUNCT__
american spend more than __MONEY__ trillion per year on heath care __PUNCT__ more than ani other countri on earth __PUNCT__
despit thi incred expenditur __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ million american don't have ani health insur at all __PUNCT__
that not just moral wrong __PUNCT__
it undercut our person secur and our competit in the global marketplac __PUNCT__
that why i introduc a true univers health care plan to cover everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child in america __PUNCT__ by the end of my first term as presid __PUNCT__
i proud to be the first and onli candid to do so __PUNCT__
we cannot wait to transform our health care system __PUNCT__
my plan set up health care market around the countri to give peopl a choic of good health care plan __PUNCT__ includ a choic between privat and govern plan __PUNCT__
it provid access to prevent care __PUNCT__
it creat effici that don't exist todai by dramat lower administr cost __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ if you don't have health care __PUNCT__ you will __PUNCT__
if you have health care __PUNCT__ your cost will go down __PUNCT__
it mai seem complic in it detail __PUNCT__ but i see health care as a simpl matter of right and wrong __PUNCT__
i believ everi singl on of us ha equal worth __PUNCT__ and we should not treat anybodi as better than anybodi els __PUNCT__
everi american __PUNCT__ rich or poor __PUNCT__ no matter which america we live in __PUNCT__ ha the right to health care __PUNCT__
my plan deliv it __PUNCT__
our domest problem ar intertwin with our global challeng __PUNCT__ and nowher is thi truer than at the nexu of global warm and energi independ __PUNCT__
global warm is a problem that is here __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ and not go awai __PUNCT__
the unit state must lead __PUNCT__ lead smart __PUNCT__ lead courag __PUNCT__ and lead by exampl __PUNCT__
it is time to ask the american peopl to be patriot about someth other than war __PUNCT__
we need invest in renew energi __PUNCT__ more effici car and truck __PUNCT__ and a nation cap on carbon emiss __PUNCT__
by take person respons for our energi us __PUNCT__ we can all reduc our impact on the environ in big wai and small __PUNCT__
thi week __PUNCT__ i announc that we go to do exactli that in our campaign __PUNCT__ our campaign is go to be carbon neutral __PUNCT__
tackl global warm through respons and conserv help reduc our relianc on foreign oil __PUNCT__
and reduc our relianc on foreign oil strengthen our nation secur __PUNCT__
but we won't stop there __PUNCT__
by creat a new energi economi __PUNCT__ by transform our energi infrastructur and invest in research __PUNCT__ develop and deploy of altern energi technolog __PUNCT__ we can not onli address global warm and energi independ __PUNCT__ we can creat more than a million new job in america __PUNCT__ and lai the foundat for a secur middl class and a manufactur base for america in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
our educ system __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ need fundament chang __PUNCT__
as i said a few minut ago __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ year after brown v __PUNCT__ board of educ __PUNCT__ our educ system remain shockingli unequ __PUNCT__
there ar nearli __NUM__ high school where more than half of the student won't graduat __PUNCT__
minor __NUM__ __PUNCT__ grader read at the same level as white __NUM__ __PUNCT__ grader __PUNCT__
our educ system shortchang the skill our children need for the futur __PUNCT__ math and scienc __PUNCT__ creativ and critic think __PUNCT__
everi dai you can read report about how we fall behind in math and scienc __PUNCT__ our __NUM__ __PUNCT__ grader ar __NUM__ in the world in scienc educ __PUNCT__
we need to fundament chang the discuss about educ in our countri __PUNCT__ to move beyond a focu on test and get to the issu of educ our children for the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
we need a seriou __PUNCT__ sustain effort to turn around fail school __PUNCT__
we should invest in our teacher __PUNCT__ the most import part of ani school __PUNCT__
we need to do more to recruit them __PUNCT__ train them __PUNCT__ and pai them __PUNCT__ particularli in math and scienc and other place where there ar teacher shortag __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ it ha been more than a centuri sinc we made high school univers __PUNCT__ but high school graduat from well __PUNCT__ off famili ar five time more like to enrol in colleg __PUNCT__
those who do go to colleg pick up larger and larger debt __PUNCT__
i have a plan call colleg for everyon that will pai for the first year of colleg for anyon will to work part __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__
and thi is on of the hallmark of the fundament chang we need __PUNCT__ we as democrat __PUNCT__
work and person respons ar good thing __PUNCT__ and we should be encourag both __PUNCT__
when we seriou about moral leadership at home __PUNCT__ we have the stand to assert moral leadership in the world __PUNCT__
and i believ we can begin by lead in area that __PUNCT__ at first glanc __PUNCT__ might not seem directli relat to our self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
i talk about global poverti __PUNCT__ primari educ __PUNCT__
but i believ if you look close __PUNCT__ it clear that these area ar in fact directli relat to our present and futur nation secur __PUNCT__
we know that terrorist thrive in fail state __PUNCT__ and in state torn apart by intern conflict and poverti __PUNCT__
and we know that in mani african and muslim countri todai __PUNCT__ extrem poverti and civil war have gut govern educ system __PUNCT__
so what take their place __PUNCT__ the answer is troubl __PUNCT__ but fill with opportun if we have the courag to seiz it __PUNCT__
a great portion of a gener is be educ in madrassa run by milit extremist rather than in public school __PUNCT__
and as a result __PUNCT__ thousand and thousand of young peopl who might onc have aspir to be educ in america ar be taught to hate america __PUNCT__
when you understand that __PUNCT__ it suddenli becom clear __PUNCT__ global poverti is not just a moral issu for the unit state __PUNCT__ it is a nation secur issu for the unit state __PUNCT__
if we tackl it __PUNCT__ we will be do a good and moral thing by help to improv the live of billion of peopl around the world who live on less than __MONEY__ per dai __PUNCT__ but we will also begin to creat a world in which the ideolog of radic terror ar overwhelm by the ideolog of educ __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ and opportun __PUNCT__
if we tackl it __PUNCT__ we have the chanc to chang a gener of potenti enemi into a gener of friend __PUNCT__
now that would be transform __PUNCT__
but the challeng is great __PUNCT__ gener struggl requir gener solut __PUNCT__ so we must meet the challeng with an audaci plan __PUNCT__
as presid i would implement a four __PUNCT__ point plan to tackl global poverti __PUNCT__ and improv the nation secur of the unit state __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ we would launch a sweep effort to support primari educ in the develop world __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ million young children have no school at all __PUNCT__ deni even a primari educ to learn how to read and write __PUNCT__
educ is particularli import for young girl __PUNCT__ as just on exampl of the rippl effect __PUNCT__ educ mother have lower rate of infant mortal and ar __NUM__ percent more like to have their children immun __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will lead a worldwid effort to extend primari educ to million of children in the develop world by fulli fund the millennium develop goal of univers primari educ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the u. __PUNCT__ will do it part by bring educ to __NUM__ million children in poor countri __PUNCT__ and we will ask our alli to step up and do the rest __PUNCT__
it not just good for our secur __PUNCT__ it good for their __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we will support prevent health care in the develop world __PUNCT__
women and children bear the burden of poverti and diseas in the develop world __PUNCT__
women in our poorest countri have a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ chanc of dy dure childbirth __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ million children die each year from prevent diseas __PUNCT__
mani of these diseas ar prevent with clean water and basic sanit or afford immun __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will conven a worldwid summit on low __PUNCT__ cost invest in clean drink water and sanit __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ will increas it invest in clean water six __PUNCT__ fold __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we can get to the root of global poverti by increas opportun __PUNCT__ polit opportun and econom opportun __PUNCT__
democrat right allow poor citizen to forc their countri to creat more progress law __PUNCT__ fight oppress and demand econom stabil __PUNCT__
econom initi like microfin and micro __PUNCT__ insur can spark entrepreneurship __PUNCT__ allow peopl to transform their own live __PUNCT__
and fourth __PUNCT__ i would appoint an individu in the white hous __PUNCT__ report directli to me __PUNCT__ with the rank of a cabinet member __PUNCT__ to overse all of our effort to fight global poverti __PUNCT__
despit it import to our nation secur __PUNCT__ the unit state still lack a comprehens strategi to fight global poverti __PUNCT__
we need to embrac the vision of john f __PUNCT__ kennedi __PUNCT__ who recogn that __PUNCT__ the nation interest and the caus of polit freedom requir __PUNCT__ american effort to lift up the world poor __PUNCT__
our current effort ha plenti of bureaucraci __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ separ u. agenc ar involv in the deliveri of foreign assist __PUNCT__
what it lack is effici and account __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i chang that __PUNCT__
accomplish these goal __PUNCT__ end poverti in america and transform our approach to poverti around the world __PUNCT__ creat a new energi economi __PUNCT__ bring health care to everi american __PUNCT__ and build an educ system that help to build and support the middl class of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ will not be easi __PUNCT__
and attempt them will requir a chang in our polit __PUNCT__
we can no longer accept have the cours of our countri dictat by a rel few peopl who push onto the rest of us polici that suit their particular interest __PUNCT__
we need leader who insist that all voic ar heard __PUNCT__ leader who will take the role harri truman defin so clearli __PUNCT__ a presid who is the lobbyist for all the peopl who don't have __PUNCT__ don't want __PUNCT__ and can't afford on __PUNCT__
but thi is not just about the leader __PUNCT__
it is also about you take respons for your own countri __PUNCT__ for your own govern __PUNCT__ for your own commun __PUNCT__ for your own famili __PUNCT__
i wa onli in the senat for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but that wa more than enough time to learn firsthand what i fear and what you know __PUNCT__ if you see a problem __PUNCT__ you can't wait for the govern to fix it __PUNCT__
we ar at on of those rare moment in histori __PUNCT__ a time when two path ar clear befor us __PUNCT__
on on side is the path we have been on __PUNCT__
it is a path in which we argu over fuel standard while global warm get wors __PUNCT__ where the senat pass non bind resolut on the war in iraq while the war escal __PUNCT__ where the middl class shrink and disappear while tax cut for the wealthiest set in __PUNCT__ a path where the two america is still there and still wrong __PUNCT__
on the other side is that futur which we have all long imagin __PUNCT__ a futur in which america moral leadership onc again make us strong and secur __PUNCT__
a futur in which the gulf between the have and have __PUNCT__ not is fade becaus we ar activ work to lift our fellow human be up from poverti __PUNCT__
where everi american ha health care __PUNCT__
where america lead the world in creat a new global economi power by clean energi __PUNCT__
where women around the world enjoi the same opportun as men __PUNCT__
a futur in which we recogn that our secur is not just measur by our militari might __PUNCT__ but by our abil and determin to build a more peac __PUNCT__ more prosper __PUNCT__ more stabl world __PUNCT__
i believ that futur is our for the take __PUNCT__
we can make it real __PUNCT__
we know that __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__ have chang the world befor __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ anoth gener of american face a world darken by insecur __PUNCT__
the storm cloud of fascism and totalitarian were gather over europ and asia __PUNCT__
we were struggl to emerg from the depth of the great depress __PUNCT__
and it wa easi to think then that our problem at home were too big for us to try to tackl the problem mount abroad __PUNCT__
yet that gener of american saw in the challeng of their dai not a caus for despair __PUNCT__ but a call to great __PUNCT__
and thei answer it __PUNCT__
not meekli __PUNCT__ not uncertainli __PUNCT__
but proudli __PUNCT__ confid __PUNCT__ and with convict __PUNCT__
becaus thei had what we have __PUNCT__ the idea of america __PUNCT__
it right here __PUNCT__
and in answer that call __PUNCT__ not onli secur freedom for the peopl of europ and asia __PUNCT__ thei laid the foundat for a new american economi that produc the greatest expans of the middl class and the sharpest reduct of poverti in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
thei turn the __NUM__ centuri into the american centuri __PUNCT__
now it is our turn __PUNCT__ to see the challeng we face with an unblink ey and onc again to answer the call __PUNCT__
proudli __PUNCT__ confid __PUNCT__ and with convict __PUNCT__
it is our respons __PUNCT__
as abraham lincoln onc call us __PUNCT__ we ar still the __PUNCT__ last best hope of earth __PUNCT__
if america doe not lead __PUNCT__ who will __PUNCT__ i believ we ar up to the task __PUNCT__
i am certain of it __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ i am an optimist __PUNCT__
