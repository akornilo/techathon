russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ john edward __PUNCT__ welcom __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ a week ago wednesdai in the new hampshir debat __PUNCT__ democrat woke up the next morn __PUNCT__ i think somewhat surpris that the three top candid __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ barack obama and john edward __PUNCT__ all said that thei could not pledg that all american troop would be out of iraq by the end of their first term in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
anoth on of your oppon __PUNCT__ governor bill richardson of new mexico __PUNCT__ issu thi statement about you __PUNCT__
he sai __PUNCT__ edward sai __PUNCT__ he would get all of the combat troop out of iraq __PUNCT__ but he would leav behind thousand of non __PUNCT__ combat troop in the middl of a civil war __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ is not end the war __PUNCT__
leav behind thousand of non __PUNCT__ combat troop contradict armi doctrin and common sens __PUNCT__
it is simpli irrespons __PUNCT__
histori teach us that put underman forc in the middl of sectarian conflict __PUNCT__ whether in somalia __PUNCT__ lebanon or anywher __PUNCT__ is a recip for disast __PUNCT__
john edward would chang the mission __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ will end the war __PUNCT__
is he correct __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ of cours he not correct __PUNCT__
thei will __PUNCT__ unless we go to close the embassi in baghdad and have the onli american embassi in the world that we provid no protect for __PUNCT__ there have to be some troop in baghdad for purpos of protect the embassi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what i also said that is also ignor in that statement is that we do need to maintain quick reaction forc just outsid of iraq __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar some real differ between myself and senat clinton on thi issu __PUNCT__
i am not for maintain troop __PUNCT__ combat troop __PUNCT__ insid iraq __PUNCT__ for a lot of reason __PUNCT__
i think number on __PUNCT__ thei have a target on their forehead while thei there __PUNCT__
number two __PUNCT__ it continu the percept that america is occupi iraq __PUNCT__
what i would do instead is outsid of iraq __PUNCT__ probabl in kuwait __PUNCT__ maintain a quick reaction forc __PUNCT__
and that quick reaction forc would be focus on the possibl of al __PUNCT__ qaeda oper __PUNCT__ not terror at larg __PUNCT__
the problem with what i hear with senat clinton sai __PUNCT__ and i heard other sai is when you talk about maintain troop __PUNCT__ combat troop insid iraq __PUNCT__ base there __PUNCT__ and thei focus on anti __PUNCT__ terror activ within iraq __PUNCT__ that veri similar to what presid bush sai __PUNCT__
it veri hard to understand what __PUNCT__ where that end __PUNCT__ where the limit ar __PUNCT__
i do think we need to end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__
i for get our combat troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
i go to be respons and protect the embassi like we do everywher els in the world __PUNCT__ but we will maintain a quick reaction forc just outsid of iraq in kuwait __PUNCT__ so that if there ar al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ let me be veri specif __PUNCT__ not gener terrorist activ __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ terrorist activ can includ ani sort of action against civilian and against the state __PUNCT__
i talk specif about public enemi number on __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ that respons for a small percentag of the insurg activ in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but as i hear you __PUNCT__ you would have signific combat troop outsid of iraq but on the border prepar to go into iraq for combat duti __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ but i want to be realli clear about someth __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
i sai someth veri differ than what senat clinton sai __PUNCT__
senat clinton ha said she will maintain troop insid iraq __PUNCT__ and that thei will engag in combat oper __PUNCT__ combat mission __PUNCT__ i think is her term __PUNCT__ insid iraq __PUNCT__
i will not do that __PUNCT__
to me __PUNCT__ that is a continu of the war __PUNCT__ and thi war need to be brought to an end __PUNCT__
i do think that america __PUNCT__ like we would anywher els in the world __PUNCT__ is focus on al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ focus on public enemi number on __PUNCT__ and we have to be readi to respond if thei plan attack insid iraq __PUNCT__ attack against us or our embassi insid iraq __PUNCT__ or attack outsid of iraq __PUNCT__
we have to be prepar to respond to that __PUNCT__ and that why i keep a quick reaction forc in kuwait __PUNCT__
but i would not __PUNCT__ as senat clinton would __PUNCT__ keep combat troop insid iraq and continu combat mission in iraq __PUNCT__
i want to be abl to sai next fall __PUNCT__ when i the democrat nomine __PUNCT__ and i stand with the republican candid __PUNCT__ that american have a veri clear choic __PUNCT__
thei can choos a republican who want to continu the war or a democrat who want to end the war __PUNCT__
we can't just be a littl bit better than them __PUNCT__
we have to be veri clear that voter have choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and senat __PUNCT__ your evolut on the war in iraq is quit extraordinari __PUNCT__
you were an origin co __PUNCT__ sponsor back in __DATE__ of __NUM__ vote for the war __PUNCT__
when you were run for vice presid __PUNCT__ __DATE__ of __NUM__ even though we had not found weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ you still said your vote wa the right cours to pursu __PUNCT__
and in __DATE__ of thi year __PUNCT__ you were on meet the press __PUNCT__ i ask you if you would cut off fund for the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and you said no __PUNCT__
you now ar in favor of cut off fund __PUNCT__ aren't you __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__
i sai the same thing now i said in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
what i have said all throughout the cours of thi campaign is what we need to do and what the congress need to do is thei need to forc georg bush hand __PUNCT__
i think the american peopl sent an absolut clear mandat in __DATE__ of __NUM__ that thei expect the congress to stand strong __PUNCT__ to be firm __PUNCT__
and the wai for the congress to do that is to ensur that everi fund bill that goe to thi presid actual ha a timet for withdraw __PUNCT__
and if bush veto that __PUNCT__ thei should send anoth bill for the timet for withdraw and thei should stand their ground __PUNCT__
there a differ between do that __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ and just cut off fund for the troop __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so you would not cut off fund __PUNCT__ and if fund ran out becaus georg bush kept veto the fund measur __PUNCT__ what would you do __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ if i were presid __PUNCT__ i would alreadi been bring the troop out __PUNCT__
if georg bush is still presid __PUNCT__ then he be in the posit of either have to sign the legisl __PUNCT__ which mean he have to meet the timet for withdraw __PUNCT__ or the monei will dry up and he have to start withdraw troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
either wai __PUNCT__ the congress ha done exactli what the american peopl ask them to do in __DATE__ of __NUM__ which is what thei should do __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ there been an interest discuss about john edward __PUNCT__
here how u. __PUNCT__ new __PUNCT__ world report wrote it __PUNCT__ the evolut of john edward __PUNCT__
and thei sai thi __PUNCT__ edward is __PUNCT__ edward ha chang consider from the happi __PUNCT__ face centrist who refrain from attack polit in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
hi appeal todai is base in larg part on hi sharp __PUNCT__ edg anti war stand __PUNCT__
thi cycl __PUNCT__ edward hope to ride a wave of liber anger and gener dissatisfact __PUNCT__
and then thi from the associ press __PUNCT__ analysi __PUNCT__ is edward real or a phoni __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__

now he more liber __PUNCT__ shift to the left along with internet __PUNCT__ fed forc within the democrat parti __PUNCT__ and vow to give healthcar to all __PUNCT__
have you shift your view for polit expedi __PUNCT__ or ha been there __PUNCT__ ha been there __PUNCT__ ha there been a profound __PUNCT__ philosoph chang within you __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i exactli the same person that i wa in __NUM__ __PUNCT__

you know __PUNCT__ i run for presid __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ on behalf of the __PUNCT__ my father __PUNCT__ who work in a mill all hi life __PUNCT__ the men and the women who work in the mill with him __PUNCT__ the men and women i grew up with who lost their job when that mill close __PUNCT__
provid that kind of chanc and opportun to everybodi is at the core of __PUNCT__ is the core of why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
that ha never chang __PUNCT__ and it is exactli the same todai __PUNCT__
i do believ that there been some chang both in america and in the world __PUNCT__
the war in iraq is much wors than it wa in __NUM__ and __NUM__ and it continu __PUNCT__
our healthcar situat is dysfunct __PUNCT__
it doe not work __PUNCT__
and i am convinc that the onli solut to thi is true __PUNCT__ univers healthcar __PUNCT__
global warm is now __PUNCT__ by anybodi measur __PUNCT__ a crisi __PUNCT__
a crisi that america ha to deal with and ha to respond to __PUNCT__
we have five million more peopl who fallen into poverti while georg bush ha been in offic __PUNCT__
and we becom a countri made up of just a few rich peopl and everybodi els __PUNCT__
what i believ __PUNCT__ and i believ it to my soul __PUNCT__ is that these problem cannot be solv with small increment chang __PUNCT__
thei can't be solv with caution __PUNCT__
we need big __PUNCT__ bold idea __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will to take on a system that stop those bold idea from go into place and that exactli what i intend to do as presid __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ a new poll out in de moin todai show you second place to hillari clinton __PUNCT__

while fortress wa incorpor in delawar __PUNCT__ it hedg fund were incorpor in the cayman island __PUNCT__ enabl it partner and foreign investor to defer or avoid pai u. __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__
why would you associ yourself with a hedg fund like that __PUNCT__ when you decri the exist of two america __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think thi is a perfectli fair question __PUNCT__
and let me answer it __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ i wa the first candid __PUNCT__ democrat or republican __PUNCT__ to lai out an aggress plan to get rid of the tax break that ar avail __PUNCT__ includ the offshor that you just spoke about __PUNCT__ that ar avail to hedg fund manag __PUNCT__
thei not right __PUNCT__ thei not fair __PUNCT__ and thei don't __PUNCT__ ar not avail to ordinari american like the on i spoke about just a few minut ago __PUNCT__
number two __PUNCT__
if you look at what i have spent my life do __PUNCT__ includ the time sinc the last elect __PUNCT__ which is exactli you focus on right now __PUNCT__ i did a whole varieti of thing __PUNCT__

these ar the thing that i spent my time do __PUNCT__ and i don't apolog for them __PUNCT__
i proud of what i spent my life do __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ my whole life and the arc of my life ha been about on singl thing __PUNCT__ which is to try to make sure that everybodi in thi countri ha the same kind of chanc that and opportun that i had __PUNCT__
and that why i want to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but work for a hedg fund that ha foreclos on mortgag in louisiana __PUNCT__ is that the kind of imag that you want to put forward in a presidenti campaign __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when i __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ when i found out that there were foreclosur go on in louisiana __PUNCT__ in new orlean __PUNCT__ which is specif what you ask about __PUNCT__ i respond immedi __PUNCT__
call the peopl at fortress __PUNCT__ told them that thei need to take action __PUNCT__
i thereaft took ani invest that i had in those __PUNCT__ in that oper out __PUNCT__
on top of that __PUNCT__ we have start a fund __PUNCT__ a home rescu fund __PUNCT__ with a local commun activist group in new orlean to actual provid help to peopl who ar have their home foreclos on in new orlean __PUNCT__
my point is realli not complic __PUNCT__
if you look at where i have spent my time __PUNCT__ and what my life ha been about __PUNCT__ instead of isol on thing in a short period of time __PUNCT__ it is veri clear what my life ha been about __PUNCT__
i have spent my life fight for the kind of peopl i grew up with __PUNCT__ for the poor __PUNCT__ for the disenfranchis __PUNCT__ and i will do it as long as i live __PUNCT__
i will do it when i presid __PUNCT__ and i will do it when i an ex __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the exchang between the edward campaign and the clinton campaign have gotten quit point in recent dai __PUNCT__
i want to ask you about thi on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ edward plai the bubba card __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the offici name of thi campaign swing is __PUNCT__ econom fair for the north countri __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ edward campaign consult david __PUNCT__ mudcat __PUNCT__ saunder __PUNCT__ and the boi call it __PUNCT__ let help john edward screw those who screw us tour __PUNCT__ mudcat sai __PUNCT__
us be rural america __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and who would that be __PUNCT__ who screw us __PUNCT__ saunder __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__ voic rise in incredul __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the clinton screw us __PUNCT__
how did the clinton screw us __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ mudcat ha __PUNCT__ ha a wai of sai thing that i wouldn't sai exactli the wai he doe __PUNCT__
what i would sai is that the system in washington where corpor __PUNCT__ big corpor and their lobbyist have entir too much influenc __PUNCT__ ha result in rural american __PUNCT__ ordinari american be left behind __PUNCT__
and my view is that we have to have __PUNCT__ we have to chang that system to bring about the substanti chang for real peopl to have the opportun that thei need __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think the system rig __PUNCT__
i don't think statu quo work __PUNCT__ and i think we have to be will to take it on __PUNCT__
and i said repeatedli __PUNCT__ and thi is similar to what mudcat just said __PUNCT__ i believ we cannot replac a group of corpor republican with a group of corpor democrat __PUNCT__
we have to actual return the power in the govern to ordinari american __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ and the reason that matter is not in the abstract __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__
lobbyist __PUNCT__ the wai the system work in washington __PUNCT__ that all process __PUNCT__
but the reason it matter is becaus it __PUNCT__ those thing stand as an impedi to univers healthcar __PUNCT__ to attack global warm __PUNCT__ to address econom inequ in thi __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ thei stand as an impedi to stop the kind of privat contract of blackwat that we seen in __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__
all that ha to chang in order for us to be abl to help the veri peopl that __PUNCT__ that i talk about __PUNCT__ and mudcat talk about __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ let me ask you someth els that mudcat said __PUNCT__ and ask you if it your view __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the toxic coattail of hillari clinton could not onli cost us an absolut certainti at the white hous __PUNCT__ but it also could cost us the u. __PUNCT__ hous of repres __PUNCT__
not onli do we lose the white hous __PUNCT__ but the collater damag from hillari clinton at the top of the ticket could cost us congress __PUNCT__
do you agre __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ here what i think __PUNCT__
i am the candid run for presid on the democrat side who actual won an elect in a red state run against the jessi helm polit machin __PUNCT__
i know what you have to do to win in battleground state __PUNCT__ and to win in tough __PUNCT__ tough congression district __PUNCT__ and what you have to do to put out your messag that work in those kind of place __PUNCT__
peopl __PUNCT__ i understand peopl who vote in those place __PUNCT__ and thei connect and relat to me __PUNCT__
so i do believ when i am the democrat nomine for presid that there is no place in america that i can't go and campaign and help our congression candid and help our senat candid __PUNCT__
i think at the end of the dai it for voter to determin what impact senat clinton would have __PUNCT__
but i think there ar clear choic between the two of us __PUNCT__
i been elect in a red state __PUNCT__ i believ that __PUNCT__ at least base on the empir data that out there __PUNCT__ indic that i am the strongest candid on the democrat side in these battleground area __PUNCT__ in these battleground state __PUNCT__
and i think that doe matter for a veri simpl reason __PUNCT__ becaus i am strongli in favor __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ of push a __PUNCT__ a progress agenda __PUNCT__
if we want big idea __PUNCT__ if we want to chang the system __PUNCT__ if we want the kind of thing i talk about univers healthcar __PUNCT__ attack global warm in a seriou __PUNCT__ seriou wai __PUNCT__ deal with incom __PUNCT__ all those thing __PUNCT__ if we want to do those thing __PUNCT__ we need to strengthen our number __PUNCT__ the democrat number __PUNCT__ in the hous and the senat __PUNCT__
and i am complet convinc that i can do that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but senat __PUNCT__ do you believ __PUNCT__ like your top __PUNCT__ on of your top advis said __PUNCT__ that hillari clinton would lose the presid and veri well lose the congress for the democrat __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i honestli don't know the answer to that __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i think there a lot of conflict out there about that question __PUNCT__
that a question senat clinton should have to answer __PUNCT__
i think voter ar go to have to make that determin __PUNCT__
but i think i __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ that an unknown __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but other peopl __PUNCT__ includ your wife __PUNCT__ elizabeth __PUNCT__ have made these kind of suggest __PUNCT__
it the eleph in the room __PUNCT__
let me read what elizabeth said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i do not __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ think the hatr against hillari clinton is justifi __PUNCT__
i don't know where it come from __PUNCT__
i don't begin to understand it __PUNCT__
but you can't pretend it doesn't exist __PUNCT__ and it will energ the republican base __PUNCT__
their nomine won't energ them __PUNCT__ bush won't __PUNCT__ but hillari as the nomine will __PUNCT__
it hard for john to talk about __PUNCT__ but it the realiti __PUNCT__
why is it hard for you to talk about __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ what you just said is differ from what you ask me just a minut ago __PUNCT__
what you said about elizabeth statement i think is true __PUNCT__
i hear a lot of those thing when i out on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
peopl __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i don't want to ignor the first part of what she said __PUNCT__
she not sai it fair __PUNCT__ she just sai that it is out there in america __PUNCT__
and i hear the same thing over and over and over __PUNCT__
what i think is imposs to predict is how that plai itself out dure the cours of a presidenti campaign __PUNCT__
i live through a presidenti campaign __PUNCT__
what i know is that voter have a veri clear choic __PUNCT__
democrat voter have a veri clear choic between senat clinton __PUNCT__ with both all the good and bad that come with her __PUNCT__ and john edward __PUNCT__ who ha actual won in a red state and who can compet everi singl place in america __PUNCT__
and we cannot lose thi elect __PUNCT__
thi is not about me __PUNCT__ it not about senat clinton __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter what happen to us __PUNCT__ person __PUNCT__
our live ar go to be fine __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ what go to happen to __NUM__ million american who have no healthcar coverag __PUNCT__
what go to happen to women who ar diagnos with breast cancer like elizabeth and have a __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent greater chanc of dy becaus thei have no healthcar coverag __PUNCT__
what go to happen to famili who ar send their children to serv in iraq and possibl die in iraq __PUNCT__
we cannot lose thi elect __PUNCT__
there is too much at stake __PUNCT__
and i think it import for democrat primari voter to know simpli that thei have choic __PUNCT__
i not sai anyth bad about senat clinton __PUNCT__
she a good candid __PUNCT__
but there ar clear choic between senat clinton and myself __PUNCT__ and i want voter to know that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ senat clinton and senat obama have both out rais you in term of campaign financ and fund __PUNCT__ rais __PUNCT__
you have now opt for public financ __PUNCT__
the dailyko web site ha said thi make you a veri danger candid becaus between the time that primari ar over and the convent start __PUNCT__ you onli have about __MONEY__ million to spend to ward off republican attack __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ and thi is on of the reason why you should not be the nomine __PUNCT__ becaus you be in such a weaken posit __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ do you want me to respond __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ pleas __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ thi is go to be an elect __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ it not go to be an auction __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we not go to determin who can rais the most monei and therebi who should be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it an amaz thing to me that when you do someth that you believ is right __PUNCT__ same thing i did in __NUM__ and __NUM__ that thi is the respons __PUNCT__
what i know is true __PUNCT__ i know that when we get to after __DATE__ and it pretti clear who the democrat nomine for presid go to be __PUNCT__ that there need to be absolut clear divis between me as the democrat nomine and the republican __PUNCT__
and i am complet convinc if i have __PUNCT__ and i believ i will __PUNCT__ beaten two celebr candid who will probabl have spent over __MONEY__ million dure the cours of the nomin process __PUNCT__ i can certainli beat a republican who carri georg bush baggag __PUNCT__
and the wai i will do it is not on the basi of monei __PUNCT__ but on the basi of what america need __PUNCT__ on the basi of principl stand __PUNCT__ on the basi of big and bold idea __PUNCT__
i want peopl to see clear differ between me and them __PUNCT__ them be the republican in thi case __PUNCT__
thei will be awash in corpor monei __PUNCT__
you can take that to the bank __PUNCT__
i will not __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ senat john edward __PUNCT__ as alwai __PUNCT__ we thank you for your view and be safe on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ thank you so much __PUNCT__
