senat __PUNCT__ thank you for come in __PUNCT__
let get right down to it __PUNCT__
thi debat in la vega wa on of the roughest yet __PUNCT__
you went directli at hillari rodham clinton __PUNCT__ and she went right back at you __PUNCT__
here what she said __PUNCT__
senat hillari rodham clinton __PUNCT__ i don't mind take hit on my record __PUNCT__ on issu __PUNCT__ but when somebodi start throw mud __PUNCT__ at least we can hope that it both accur and not right out of the republican playbook __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ so ar you oper out of the republican playbook __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__ good morn __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
i don't __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__
what she wa respond to wa me tell the truth about some differ that we have on issu of war __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i wa talk about iraq __PUNCT__ what i want to do in iraq __PUNCT__ which is get all combat troop out and end combat mission __PUNCT__ she ha a differ view about that __PUNCT__ and differ we have about iran __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i believ we have to be veri __PUNCT__ veri strong in stop georg bush in hi march to war with iran __PUNCT__ and she vote in a differ wai and vote with bush on that issu __PUNCT__
and i wa just point out those differ __PUNCT__ and i think she complet entitl to take her posit and defend her posit __PUNCT__ it a __PUNCT__ it a presidenti campaign __PUNCT__
but the idea that thi is mudsling __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we talk about substant issu of war that ar go to affect the next presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and i might __PUNCT__ i might add __PUNCT__ have been through a gener elect __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ if anybodi __PUNCT__ includ senat clinton __PUNCT__ think thi is mudsling __PUNCT__ thei got thing __PUNCT__ thei __PUNCT__ thi is milquetoast compar to what we go to see next fall __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ we need to have __PUNCT__ we need to have a candid who actual readi for that battl __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let me just ask you thi __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
did you believ that hillari clinton shouldn't be elect presid __PUNCT__ or that she can't be elect presid __PUNCT__ do you believ she is not elect __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i wouldn't sai either on of those thing __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ i think that __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ democrat voter ar go to have real choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we have differ approach __PUNCT__
i have a differ approach to washington __PUNCT__
i think there some real chang in __PUNCT__ that need to be done in washington with respect to the wai the system oper __PUNCT__ and what i see is some corrupt of the system over time __PUNCT__
she ha a differ view about that __PUNCT__
as i just mention __PUNCT__ she ha differ view about iraq __PUNCT__ iran and some other issu __PUNCT__
so we __PUNCT__ i want to be certain that the voter know that thei have veri clear choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ and in my case it somebodi that go to fight for them __PUNCT__ fight for work peopl and fight for that chang __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as to who can best be elect __PUNCT__ what i __PUNCT__ network audio difficulti __PUNCT__ __URL__ i the candid who actual won in a red state __PUNCT__
i grew up in a small town in rural america __PUNCT__
so i think i can go anywher in the countri and campaign and compet __PUNCT__
and i let senat clinton make the case for herself __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ you mention that she is a defend of a system that you have call __PUNCT__ rig __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ corrupt __PUNCT__
do you believ that she is corrupt __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ and i never said that __PUNCT__
i think that veri good peopl get pull into thi system and get accustom to it __PUNCT__ and can i just sai __PUNCT__ on my own behalf __PUNCT__ i myself have been guilti __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ there no wai i holier __PUNCT__ than __PUNCT__ thou about thi __PUNCT__
i turn my head myself __PUNCT__
and i think we just now reach the stage that we can't continu to do it __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ just in the last week __PUNCT__ we saw that there wa an effort made by the congress to get cheaper gener drug on the market more quickli to help peopl who were go to the pharmaci to bui their prescript drug __PUNCT__
and the drug compani and their lobbyist spent million of dollar lobbi to congress last year __PUNCT__ i think almost __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__ and thei manag to kill it __PUNCT__
and basic __PUNCT__ what thei kill wa an effort to stop the bribe of gener compani by big drug compani __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thi is just on indic of a symptom of a much more pervas problem __PUNCT__
and i do believ that we have to weed that corrupt out of the system and make it work for the major of american in order to do the big thing we need to do __PUNCT__ attack global warm __PUNCT__ have univers health care __PUNCT__ the big issu that face america __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ what ar the differ between take monei from the drug compani lobbyist and from trial lawyer __PUNCT__ which you take monei from __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ as i said just a minut ago __PUNCT__ i don't claim puriti and i don't claim holier __PUNCT__ than __PUNCT__ thou __PUNCT__
i rais over __MONEY__ million in thi campaign __PUNCT__
i think all of us share some respons in that regard __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it is true that i never taken ani monei from a washington lobbyist the entir time i been in public life __PUNCT__ or from a pac __PUNCT__ a special interest pac __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ and i proud of that __PUNCT__
but thi is not about me or senat clinton __PUNCT__ thi is about what we have to do to clean up thi system __PUNCT__
and i think the differ is that lobbyist __PUNCT__ regist lobbyist in washington __PUNCT__ their job is to pedal influenc __PUNCT__
their job is to ensur that their client __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__ big compani __PUNCT__ in most case __PUNCT__ that thei repres __PUNCT__ get their wai and the wai law ar written __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ so i think __PUNCT__ particularli in that case __PUNCT__ we have to be veri __PUNCT__ veri care about limit their influenc __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ but you __PUNCT__ you not try to tell me here thi morn __PUNCT__ ar you __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ that trial lawyer don't have an interest in what happen in washington and what happen in the congress __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ lord __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ not onli wouldn't i sai that __PUNCT__ trial lawyer have lobbyist in washington __PUNCT__ just like everi other group that try to influenc the congress __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ far from it __PUNCT__
i not sai that __PUNCT__
and what i would sai is we ought to __PUNCT__ we ought to take all of their monei influenc out __PUNCT__
none of them should have __PUNCT__ all of them ar entitl to a voic __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
the lawyer ar entitl to a voic __PUNCT__ the doctor ar entitl to a voic __PUNCT__ even the big corpor ar entitl to a voic __PUNCT__
the problem is __PUNCT__ becaus thei have so much monei __PUNCT__ particularli the big corpor __PUNCT__ and becaus thei spend so much monei in lobbi __PUNCT__ drug compani __PUNCT__ insur compani __PUNCT__ oil compani __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ the net result is their influenc is wai out of proport to the influenc that ordinari american have __PUNCT__ and i think thei distort the law that result from that influenc __PUNCT__
and what we have to do is start make thi democraci work for everybodi __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ let me ask you thi __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ about on of your recent ad __PUNCT__
on of your ad sai that if you ar presid and congress doesn't pass univers health care by __DATE__ you ar go to us your power as presid to take congress __PUNCT__ health care plan awai from them __PUNCT__
how do you go about do that __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ can i just add on thing __PUNCT__ schieffer __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ there is anoth piec to that __PUNCT__
i also sai that i will take awai __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ us my power __PUNCT__ the power that i have avail to take awai the health care for member of my administr __PUNCT__
and the basic idea is i don't think politician in washington should be protect their health care when we have __NUM__ million peopl in thi countri who don't have health care coverag __PUNCT__
but to answer your question __PUNCT__ the most power tool that the presid ha is the bulli pulpit __PUNCT__
and that mean make the case to america __PUNCT__ submit legisl to support exactli what i just said __PUNCT__ and then make the case to america in ani place __PUNCT__ ani congression district or ani state where a senat is oppos it __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ your senat __PUNCT__ your congressman is defend their health care at the same time that thei not provid health care for you __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ and i think that the most power tool __PUNCT__
but i would add to that __PUNCT__ there ar other tool __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ the presid of the unit state ha veto power over budget __PUNCT__
so there ar other tool avail __PUNCT__
but the most import thing is __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__ wit __PUNCT__ somebodi got to shake that place up __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__
graham __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ peopl have gotten complac __PUNCT__
the politician take care of themselv __PUNCT__ the lobbyist ar everywher __PUNCT__ and i think we ax to __PUNCT__ actual need to shake the place up __PUNCT__
and that what i talk about do __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ but what you talk about here __PUNCT__ you would actual propos legisl to forc congress to give up it own health care and forc them to vote on that __PUNCT__ is that __PUNCT__ is that what you sai __PUNCT__ if thei don't come around to provid health care for the rest of the countri __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ that exactli right __PUNCT__
the whole point of thi is not to take congress __PUNCT__ health care awai __PUNCT__
the point of thi is to get health care for america __PUNCT__
and i actual believ everi democrat member of congress in the hous and the senat would vote for that __PUNCT__ so it wouldn't be an issu for them __PUNCT__
and i suspect a lot of republican would __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ becaus thei don't want to have to go home and defend __PUNCT__ in their congression district __PUNCT__ have support their own health care and not have support health care for their constitu __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ let take a break here __PUNCT__
we be back and continu thi convers in __NUM__ second __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ announc __PUNCT__ schieffer __PUNCT__ back again with senat john edward __PUNCT__
senat __PUNCT__ i like to __PUNCT__ you talk and we talk about senat clinton __PUNCT__
i like to talk about some of the differ __PUNCT__
you talk about her plan and what you see her do regard iran and also iraq __PUNCT__
what the differ in what you would do about iraq and what she would do __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think there ar some basic question that all of the presidenti candid should answer __PUNCT__
basic __PUNCT__ all of us ar sai rhetor that we will end the war __PUNCT__
but i think peopl ar entitl to more specif inform than that __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ do you have a specif plan __PUNCT__ how mani troop will you get out over what period of time __PUNCT__ and is there some point at which all combat troop will be out of iraq __PUNCT__ will combat mission ceas in iraq __PUNCT__ will you keep perman militari base in iraq __PUNCT__ the answer to those question for me __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__ is i would get all combat troop out within nine to __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ ceas combat mission __PUNCT__ and no perman militari base __PUNCT__
and i haven't heard a specif plan from senat clinton __PUNCT__
i don't think she said exactli what she would do __PUNCT__ except that i have heard her sai on a stage stand next to me that she would keep combat troop station in iraq and she would continu combat mission in iraq __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ for me __PUNCT__ that a continu of the occup of iraq __PUNCT__ which is a huge issu for america and the world __PUNCT__
so we have a differ perspect about that __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ don't we have to be veri care __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ that what we do and if we draw down __PUNCT__ that if we draw down too fast that thi mai be misread by other in the neighborhood out there __PUNCT__ how do you address that __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
and i think the presid of the unit state ha a respons to do thi the right wai __PUNCT__ and what i would do is take __NUM__ to __NUM__ combat troop out immedi __PUNCT__ intensifi the effort to make __PUNCT__ to push the shia and sunni leadership to reach a polit compromis __PUNCT__
i would also engag in realli intens diplomaci with other countri in the region __PUNCT__ particularli the iranian and the syrian __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ thei have an interest in a stabl iraq __PUNCT__
and then we have an interest in the region __PUNCT__ which mean we need to maintain a naval presenc in the persian gulf __PUNCT__ we mai need to beef up our presenc in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we probabl should keep a quick reaction forc in kuwait __PUNCT__
so it not like we abandon the region __PUNCT__
but i think we need to make it absolut clear that we end our occup of iraq __PUNCT__ which is why i laid out the propos i did __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ presid bush sai we cannot allow iran to gain the knowledg to build nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
do you agre with him __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i not entir sure what he mean by that __PUNCT__
i think that what we know is that we have a presid __PUNCT__ ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ who radic and bellicos in hi rhetor about us __PUNCT__ about israel __PUNCT__ about our alli __PUNCT__ and i also __PUNCT__ we also know that the iranian peopl have histor been among the most moder in the muslim world and the most pro __PUNCT__ american in the muslim world __PUNCT__
i think that present a huge opportun to america if we smart __PUNCT__
if we work with our european friend and the european bank system to put a clear propos veri publicli on the tabl for the iranian __PUNCT__ that we will help them with their economi in a seriou wai __PUNCT__ becaus their economi in shambl __PUNCT__ if thei give up their nuclear prolifer ambit __PUNCT__
but if thei don't __PUNCT__ there will be sever econom consequ __PUNCT__
but i do believ that we __PUNCT__ the vote on the iranian revolutionari guard and whether to declar that group a terrorist organ wa a critic moment for the democrat __PUNCT__ and i think it wa realli import for us to stand up to bush and chenei __PUNCT__
and senat dodd and senat clinton vote __PUNCT__ as i believ wa __PUNCT__ took the correct posit and were strong __PUNCT__
senat clinton vote the other wai and she entitl to do that __PUNCT__
i just have a strong disagr with her about it __PUNCT__
and then recent __PUNCT__ as you well know __PUNCT__ the administr declar the iranian revolutionari guard a terrorist organ and a prolifer of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ which is exactli what a lot of us had fear __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ some democrat __PUNCT__ some critic of the administr __PUNCT__ sai the presid is realli just look for an excus to get into iran __PUNCT__ to go in there with bomb strike or some kind of militari action __PUNCT__
ar you on of those who believ that __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think it possibl __PUNCT__
i can't read georg bush mind __PUNCT__
i gave that up __PUNCT__ network audio difficulti __PUNCT__
but what i __PUNCT__ what i do see is i see a continu pattern of behavior that veri similar to the pattern of behavior lead to iraq __PUNCT__
and i think that why it crucial for us __PUNCT__ between now and __DATE__ of __NUM__ to take everi step we can take to stand strongli against bush and chenei continu to move forward and on the march to militari action in iran __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ and on more question about foreign polici __PUNCT__ and that is pakistan __PUNCT__ presid musharraf __PUNCT__
the unit state __PUNCT__ deputi secretari of state john negropont deliv a veri blunt messag to him yesterdai __PUNCT__ told him to lift the emerg rule and restor the constitut __PUNCT__
he given no sign that he go to do that __PUNCT__
should we begin to cut off militari aid to pakistan __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we ought to __PUNCT__ at a minimum __PUNCT__ that is the leverag that we have __PUNCT__ and we ought to __PUNCT__ at a minimum __PUNCT__ reform that aid __PUNCT__
becaus essenti what we been do is we have been aid musharraf __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we help musharraf with f __PUNCT__ 16 __PUNCT__
we help musharraf in support hi power base as oppos to do what we need to do for the pakistani peopl __PUNCT__
and i believ we ought to reform the natur of the aid we provid __PUNCT__
we ought to make certain that we push toward fight against terror __PUNCT__ toward protect __PUNCT__ toward do what we need to do in the northwest __PUNCT__ what need to be done in the northwest territori __PUNCT__ provid help directli to the pakistani peopl to move them in the right direct __PUNCT__
i also think that we have some veri basic thing that we ought to be do that we not do __PUNCT__
we ought to be approach thi problem multilater with our friend around the world __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ we ought to __PUNCT__ we ought to have a better knowledg base within our own govern about the pakistani peopl __PUNCT__ their histori __PUNCT__
there wa a report just a few dai ago indic we had veri littl expertis in that regard __PUNCT__
and we need intens diplomaci __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i think all those thing ar the comprehens wai of deal with thi issu __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
forti __PUNCT__ six dai to the iowa caucus __PUNCT__
the poll suggest it a dead heat __PUNCT__
do __PUNCT__ is it __PUNCT__ is it iowa for you __PUNCT__ and if you don't win there or do well __PUNCT__ is your campaign done __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think anybodi who doesn't do well in iowa go to have a struggl __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we know that over the last few elect cycl the winner of the iowa caucu end up be the democrat nomine __PUNCT__
as you point out __PUNCT__ it a __PUNCT__ it basic a tie there __PUNCT__ at least accord to the public poll __PUNCT__
and i think if __PUNCT__ i think it be a veri intens campaign process for the next __PUNCT__ what did you sai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ i haven't kept track of __PUNCT__ track of the exact dai __PUNCT__
but i know we get close __PUNCT__
and i live through thi befor __PUNCT__ i know what iowa caucu __PUNCT__ goer care about __PUNCT__ i know what thei concern about __PUNCT__
i think thei look for the candid who thei believ is readi to be presid __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ second __PUNCT__ ha specif __PUNCT__ veri specif idea about what need to be done __PUNCT__ and i lead on all the big __PUNCT__ major issu in lai out a posit __PUNCT__ veri specif agenda __PUNCT__
and third __PUNCT__ thei look for somebodi who can win in the gener elect __PUNCT__ becaus thei don't want __PUNCT__ thei don't want to see four __PUNCT__ eight more year of republican __PUNCT__ of a republican white hous __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
what do you think __PUNCT__ do well __PUNCT__ mean __PUNCT__ you said anybodi who doesn't do well will have a struggl from here on __PUNCT__
what is do well for you in iowa __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ obvious for ani of the three of us who ar ti __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ senat clinton or myself __PUNCT__ win is do well __PUNCT__
but if it close __PUNCT__ and it a close contest __PUNCT__ then that could also be do well __PUNCT__
finish second or close could be do well __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ i think it veri hard to sai in advanc what that mean __PUNCT__
but i think it __PUNCT__ i do want to sai __PUNCT__ i think it a veri import place __PUNCT__ just as new hampshir __PUNCT__ south carolina and nevada ar to all three of us __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
