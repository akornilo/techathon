tonight __PUNCT__ i want to talk about intoler and inequ and the insidi wai thei feed on each other __PUNCT__ hurt not onli the peopl and group thei target __PUNCT__ but all of us and the futur of our countri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we obvious heard a lot about thi late thank to the repugn remark of on broadcast on the radio and televis last week __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i find it astonish that there wa even a debat over whether don imu __PUNCT__ comment cross the line __PUNCT__
and i know i don't have to tell anybodi here __PUNCT__ don imu __PUNCT__ comment didn't just cross the line __PUNCT__
thei defin the line that divid thi countri like the blade of a knife __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ there can be no debat over how much bigotri is too much bigotri __PUNCT__
ani bigotri is too much __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ there can be no question of how much intoler thi countri can toler __PUNCT__ we have alreadi toler it effect for far too long __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and let be crystal clear __PUNCT__ intoler affect everyth __PUNCT__ start with our economi and end with our abil to lead at a time of massiv global chang and new threat to our secur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think some peopl realli believ that we have put these thing behind us __PUNCT__ that the civil right movement took care of all that and everyon is on a level plai field now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think some peopl realli believ that all you have to do to succe in thi countri is pull yourself up by your bootstrap and work hard __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i can tell you __PUNCT__ i have travel all over thi countri and i have been in the place where peopl bootstrap ar worn to a thread from all the pull thei been do __PUNCT__
place where all the hard work in the world hasn't help to pull them out of poverti __PUNCT__ becaus the system discrimin and opportun isn't equal __PUNCT__
but if we come togeth and ar honest about it __PUNCT__ we can chang that and build an america that give everi american an equal chanc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ there is no question in my mind that intoler is a direct caus of on of our greatest and most threaten problem __PUNCT__ the grow dispar between rich and poor __PUNCT__ between have and have not __PUNCT__ between work peopl and all those power forc who do not have their best interest in mind __PUNCT__
becaus guess what __PUNCT__ the peopl that ar usual the target of intoler and bigotri ar too often the same peopl who suffer from lack of opportun __PUNCT__ the same peopl who ar left behind __PUNCT__
and as long as intoler pervad our cultur __PUNCT__ it far too easi for politician in washington to ignor the big chang we need to make in order to end poverti onc and for all __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i don't just talk about these issu here __PUNCT__ racial intoler __PUNCT__ the two america that still exist __PUNCT__ i talk about them everywher i go __PUNCT__ becaus it silenc that allow them to surviv and even thrive __PUNCT__
and i hope everyon run for presid will do the same __PUNCT__ becaus we have an oblig and the opportun to help end the silenc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it a shame we have to wait for the don imu __PUNCT__ of the world to provok a nation convers through bigotri __PUNCT__ but we should jump at the chanc to have thi convers __PUNCT__ not just to look at whatev bigotri li in our own heart __PUNCT__ but to final engag on a problem that isn't go anywher unless we do someth about it __PUNCT__
and our strength as a nation depend on it __PUNCT__
