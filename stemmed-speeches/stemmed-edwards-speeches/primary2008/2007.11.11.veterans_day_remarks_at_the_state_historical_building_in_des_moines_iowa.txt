we set asid a few dai each year in honor of america and those ideal that make us american __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ equal __PUNCT__ thank for the bless of our inherit __PUNCT__
but thi weekend on dai stand apart __PUNCT__ although it began that wai __PUNCT__ it no longer commemor a specif event __PUNCT__ it is not dedic to ani on individu __PUNCT__ instead it honor the sacrific of million __PUNCT__ across all the gener of america __PUNCT__
sinc georg washington continent armi fought to creat thi nation __PUNCT__ million of men and women have put on america uniform to defend __PUNCT__ protect and carri the caus of freedom for all human __PUNCT__
with valor and sacrific __PUNCT__ through hardship and peril __PUNCT__ thei have chang the cours of histori for our nation and the world __PUNCT__
let us begin todai with a moment of silent prayer for all those who have serv in our arm forc ever sinc there ha been an idea and a place call america __PUNCT__
for our veteran __PUNCT__ join me in a prayer of thank __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
veteran dai is a time to rememb our men and women in uniform who have serv and sacrif and risk for our nation __PUNCT__ and the too mani __PUNCT__ far too mani who have lost life __PUNCT__ blood __PUNCT__ and limb so that we could live free __PUNCT__ and enjoi our right and liberti __PUNCT__
as mani of you know __PUNCT__ elizabeth come from a militari famili __PUNCT__ her father vincent wa a navi pilot for more than __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ a real hero __PUNCT__ who flew reconnaiss mission over china and north korea and won the distinguish fly cross __PUNCT__
so we know person how sacr thi dai is for all who have serv and ar serv todai __PUNCT__
but thi dai is about more than rememb and honor our veteran __PUNCT__
it is a dai to reflect on what it mean to be american __PUNCT__
to consid not just the sacrific of those who serv in uniform __PUNCT__ but what their sacrific demand of each of us __PUNCT__
it is a dai to look at the ideal of america and reflect on our own oblig and respons to keep that ideal aliv __PUNCT__
that our veteran have kept faith there can be no doubt __PUNCT__
todai we must ask ourselv if we have done the same __PUNCT__
for twenti gener __PUNCT__ american have kept the on moral command that make us american __PUNCT__ to pass a better futur on to our children than we receiv __PUNCT__
my father had to borrow __MONEY__ to bring me home from the hospit __PUNCT__
home wa a small hous in the mill villag own by the mill where my father work __PUNCT__
i am here todai becaus __PUNCT__ like all the peopl my father work with in the mill __PUNCT__ my parent got up everi dai believ in the promis of america __PUNCT__ and thei work hard __PUNCT__ no matter what obstacl were thrown against them __PUNCT__ to give me the chanc for a better life __PUNCT__
but everywher i travel todai __PUNCT__ in everi corner of america __PUNCT__ i hear uncertainti __PUNCT__ a real concern that we could be the first gener of american that fail to leav our children a better futur than our parent left us __PUNCT__
to be the first gener of american to fail that command would be an abomin __PUNCT__
thi is the great moral test of our gener __PUNCT__ to ensur that we give our children a better futur than we inherit __PUNCT__ just as our parent did for us __PUNCT__
it is not surpris peopl ar worri that the promis of america is at risk __PUNCT__ the warn sign ar everywher __PUNCT__
we see the gap between those at the veri top and everyon els grow wider and wider everi dai __PUNCT__
thirti __PUNCT__ seven million american __PUNCT__ citizen of the richest countri on earth __PUNCT__ still live in poverti __PUNCT__
forti __PUNCT__ seven million american live without health care __PUNCT__
lobbyist and corpor power run rampant in washington __PUNCT__ subvert our govern to it own end __PUNCT__ nafta __PUNCT__ style trade deal pad corpor profit but cost million of american job __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ call prescript drug reform benefit drug compani __PUNCT__ not patient __PUNCT__ tax break and loophol ar shower on the veri wealthiest while work american struggl to get by __PUNCT__
georg washington led the continent armi that enabl the creation of our nation __PUNCT__ hi name symbol the great of america __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ the citi that bear hi name symbol what is wrong with america __PUNCT__
last centuri __PUNCT__ we had a presid who remind us that the onli thing we have to fear is fear itself __PUNCT__
now we have a presid who sai be afraid __PUNCT__ be veri afraid __PUNCT__
he us fear to sell us a war we did not need to fight __PUNCT__
he us fear to trampl over our civil liberti and defac the bill of right __PUNCT__
but the blame for all of thi doe not lie onli with presid bush __PUNCT__
too mani politician __PUNCT__ at worst __PUNCT__ without convict __PUNCT__ or at best __PUNCT__ without courag __PUNCT__ have stood by and let all of thi happen __PUNCT__
here the hard truth __PUNCT__
it not just politician __PUNCT__
it not just republican or democrat or even just washington __PUNCT__
it all of us __PUNCT__
thi is our democraci __PUNCT__ if it is fail us __PUNCT__ we have nowher to look but to ourselv __PUNCT__
but here anoth __PUNCT__ greater truth __PUNCT__ in america __PUNCT__ true power doe not lie in the arm of a deceit presid __PUNCT__ cynic politician __PUNCT__ or calcul insid __PUNCT__ it li with all of us __PUNCT__
thi is our democraci __PUNCT__ to reclaim it __PUNCT__ we need onli look to ourselv __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ clean up washington won't solv everyth by itself __PUNCT__ washington is the problem that stop us from deal with our problem __PUNCT__
if we ar go to meet the challeng we face and prevail over them __PUNCT__ we must fix our broken system and we must think as big as the challeng we face __PUNCT__
our idea must be bold enough to succe and our govern must be free to enact them without compromis principl or sacrif result __PUNCT__
on without the other isn't good enough __PUNCT__
all the big idea in the world won't make a differ if thei have to go through thi broken system that remain control by big busi and their lobbyist __PUNCT__
and if we fix the system __PUNCT__ but aren't honest with the american peopl about the scope of our challeng and what requir of each of us to meet them __PUNCT__ then we be left with the babi step and increment measur that ar washington poor excus for progress __PUNCT__
but if we do both __PUNCT__ if we have the courag to offer real chang and the determin to chang washington __PUNCT__ then we will meet the great moral test of our gener __PUNCT__
we will leav our children a greater america __PUNCT__ on america __PUNCT__ where everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child is bless with the same __PUNCT__ great opportun and held to the same __PUNCT__ just rule __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ it about __NUM__ page long __PUNCT__ so ixe2x80x99m not go to read the whole thing __PUNCT__ but here the big pictur __PUNCT__
i believ there ar four broad area we must tackl __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to stand up for work and middl class famili __PUNCT__
we need __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__ to invest in fight poverti __PUNCT__ strengthen worker right to organ __PUNCT__ and smarter and safer trade __PUNCT__ if we ar to build a stronger and larger middl class __PUNCT__
we need to pass univers health care __PUNCT__
achiev univers health care will help everyon __PUNCT__ by cover the __NUM__ million american who lack health care __PUNCT__ and bring more choic __PUNCT__ more secur __PUNCT__ lower cost __PUNCT__ and better care to the rest of us __PUNCT__
but it is onli go to happen if we fight for it and share respons for get there __PUNCT__
busi and the govern must sacrific and pai their fair share __PUNCT__
the second thing we need to do restor america moral leadership around the world __PUNCT__ which start with end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
we need a new path to stop terror that bring nation togeth in a counter __PUNCT__ terror allianc __PUNCT__ we becom stronger and safer __PUNCT__ not weaker __PUNCT__ when we work with the world __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ we need to stand up __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ and tell thi congress that we elect them to end the war in iraq and bring our brave men and women home __PUNCT__
the third thing we need to do is to invest in a better futur for our children __PUNCT__
we need to invest in improv our school and make colleg afford so that we can compet in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and we need to face what mai be the great challeng of thi gener __PUNCT__ address global warm __PUNCT__
for the sake of our nation and domest secur __PUNCT__ we need a histor shift in how we make and us energi __PUNCT__
we need to cut our emiss of greenhous gase by __NUM__ percent by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we mai face higher energi bill as we make thi transit __PUNCT__

and i believ there is a sacr contract between our countri and our veteran and arm forc __PUNCT__
we have a moral oblig to take care of them and their famili __PUNCT__
those who fought to creat thi nation did not liber thi ground for freedom and democraci so that some two centuri later __PUNCT__ on our watch __PUNCT__ govern of the peopl would becom govern of the corpor interest __PUNCT__
those who gave their live at gettysburg and antietam in the name of union and equal did not die for a nation __PUNCT__ on our watch __PUNCT__ still divid by opportun and justic __PUNCT__
those who fell at guadalcan and at normandi to save the world from tyranni did not perish to let corrupt seep into our govern slowli and persist over decad almost unnot until __PUNCT__ on our watch __PUNCT__ it threaten the lifeblood of our democraci __PUNCT__
those who fell in vietnam __PUNCT__ who did what their leader ask of them long after those leader knew it wa a mistak __PUNCT__ and whose valor __PUNCT__ braveri and sacrific wa all the harder to bear becaus thei suffer their wound without the full support of the american peopl __PUNCT__ did not fall so that __PUNCT__ on our watch __PUNCT__ we would toler leader who onc more would refus to admit their mistak __PUNCT__ but instead press on with a war that should have end a long time ago __PUNCT__
those who di defend freedom and the right of american for all time did not die so that __PUNCT__ on our watch __PUNCT__ we would let the presid take those right awai __PUNCT__
thei did not die for a __NUM__ centuri america where poverti is still endem __PUNCT__ on of everi three african __PUNCT__ american children ha no health care __PUNCT__ and on in four homeless peopl ar veteran __PUNCT__
all those who have serv our nation from vallei forg to baghdad have risk everyth thei have and everyth thei ar __PUNCT__ not so the torch that american pass from on gener to the next __PUNCT__ the torch of a better america __PUNCT__ might be drop __PUNCT__ but to keep it burn strong __PUNCT__
in their name __PUNCT__ we must no longer turn our head __PUNCT__
we must no longer live in vagu acknowledg of the corrupt and incompet that threaten the promis of our children futur while sai to ourselv __PUNCT__ the problem just too big __PUNCT__ there noth we can do about it __PUNCT__
i stand befor you todai to sai __PUNCT__ that is not good enough __PUNCT__
there is someth we can do __PUNCT__
our founder place the ultim power in our hand __PUNCT__ our alon __PUNCT__
when we take it rein __PUNCT__ it is irresist __PUNCT__
if someon tell you there is noth we can do __PUNCT__ you tell them the ghost of gener prove them wrong __PUNCT__ there is noth we cannot do __PUNCT__
it will not be easi __PUNCT__ but we ar american __PUNCT__ we never take the easi wai out __PUNCT__
