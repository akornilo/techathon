thank you __PUNCT__
good to see all of you __PUNCT__
there been a lot of talk up here in new hampshir about chang late __PUNCT__
but chang is just a word when it not back up by real action __PUNCT__
anybodi can sai it __PUNCT__
it what you do that show whether you realli mean it __PUNCT__
to actual creat chang __PUNCT__ we should start by tell the truth __PUNCT__
here the truth __PUNCT__ the system in washington is broken __PUNCT__
monei is corrupt our democraci __PUNCT__
lobbyist and the special interest thei repres ar pour million of dollar into the system __PUNCT__ and stop the chang we need dead in it track __PUNCT__
our found father intend our govern to do the will of the peopl __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ it do the will of the special interest instead __PUNCT__
the cynic sai that it will alwai be thi wai __PUNCT__
thei sai that the kind of big __PUNCT__ bold chang we need todai can't be achiev __PUNCT__ and we just shouldn't try __PUNCT__
but you can't listen to them __PUNCT__
we done it befor __PUNCT__ and we can do it again __PUNCT__
throughout our histori __PUNCT__ there have been time when good peopl have had to take the power back from the power interest __PUNCT__
thi is on of those time __PUNCT__
a centuri ago __PUNCT__ the system wa broken __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
power busi interest establish control over the biggest sector of the american economi __PUNCT__
men like rockefel and carnegi collud to control price __PUNCT__ elimin competit __PUNCT__ and manipul the free market in the name of their own narrow interest __PUNCT__
then as now __PUNCT__ the american peopl knew the system wa broken __PUNCT__
and thei had the same choic that we have todai __PUNCT__ accept it __PUNCT__ or demand chang __PUNCT__
we all know what happen __PUNCT__
thei demand chang __PUNCT__ and elect a leader name theodor roosevelt to deliv it __PUNCT__
becaus of roosevelt leadership __PUNCT__ the come decad were known as the __PUNCT__ american centuri __PUNCT__ and in it we built the biggest __PUNCT__ strongest __PUNCT__ most prosper middl class in histori __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ power special interest have establish control over our democraci __PUNCT__
but what we face todai is not a monopoli of control over our economi __PUNCT__ it is a monopoli of influenc over our govern __PUNCT__
we can fix thi broken system __PUNCT__ as gener befor us fix the problem thei face in their time __PUNCT__
but we need a leader who won't accept the corrupt in washington __PUNCT__
we need a leader strong enough to sai __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ to monei from lobbyist and special interest __PUNCT__
we need a leader who will fight for the big chang we need to see __PUNCT__
to clean up our govern __PUNCT__ you have to do two thing __PUNCT__
you have to be commit to chang the system __PUNCT__
and you have to run a campaign that doe not take monei from lobbyist or special interest __PUNCT__ so you ar not beholden to the peopl who ar corrupt our system by the time you get to washington __PUNCT__
you can't do on without the other __PUNCT__
you have to do both __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ more than ani other __PUNCT__ the candid who stand with the special interest will lose __PUNCT__
i have fought the special interest my entir life __PUNCT__
as a lawyer __PUNCT__ i defend hard __PUNCT__ work american dure the toughest time of their live against the big corpor that were try to victim them __PUNCT__
as a unit state senat __PUNCT__ i unseat a corrupt republican incumb in a red state __PUNCT__ becaus the voter knew that i would fight for them __PUNCT__ and not the special interest __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i am run for presid to end the corrupt system in washington __PUNCT__ and return the power of thi govern back to the hard __PUNCT__ work peopl of america __PUNCT__
and i am refus to take monei from lobbyist and special interest __PUNCT__ becaus if there on thing i learn out here on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ it that the american peopl ar look for more than just talk about chang __PUNCT__
thei ar look for a leader who will back up their word with action __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar sick and tire of busi as usual __PUNCT__
the statu quo and the washington establish will not get us the chang we need __PUNCT__
when i wa in congress __PUNCT__ i saw what busi as usual look like __PUNCT__
sometim it blatant __PUNCT__ like the time current hous minor leader john boehner hand out check from big tobacco compani to lawmak on the floor of the hous of repres __PUNCT__
or the time someon offer __MONEY__ to congressman nick smith son campaign in exchang for a vote __PUNCT__
but usual __PUNCT__ it more subtl __PUNCT__
the influenc peddler bui seat at the tabl where decis ar made __PUNCT__
thei explain their special need to politician __PUNCT__ in their offic and at cocktail parti __PUNCT__
and thei surround them with hand __PUNCT__ pick expert who will back up their case __PUNCT__
the problem is that on side of the argument usual ha all the monei and all the manpow __PUNCT__
it like a courtroom where onli on side of the case is be argu __PUNCT__
if you want to see how the special interest get their wai __PUNCT__ just look at the univers health care bill that senat clinton tri to get pass in the 1990 __PUNCT__
at first __PUNCT__ the american peopl support her propos __PUNCT__
but then the health insur compani deploi armi of lobbyist to capitol hill to pressur lawmak __PUNCT__
thei spent million of dollar on televis ad __PUNCT__
and thei won __PUNCT__
i believ senat clinton deserv credit for her effort __PUNCT__
her plan wasn't perfect __PUNCT__ but it includ a lot of good idea __PUNCT__
the place where she and i differ is the lesson we learn sinc then __PUNCT__
she seem to think that you should still give lobbyist a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__
i think if you give them a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__ thei eat all the food __PUNCT__
she seem to think you can talk about end the influenc of lobbyist __PUNCT__ but still take million of dollar from them __PUNCT__
i believ that if you ar seriou about end the influenc of lobbyist __PUNCT__ you have to stop take their monei __PUNCT__
when i challeng her on thi __PUNCT__ she respond by defend the system __PUNCT__
i don't think you can talk about chang america __PUNCT__ and then turn around and defend the broken system in washington __PUNCT__
and i think if you ar go to talk about end the influenc of special interest __PUNCT__ you can't turn around and hold a fundrais where you bring the special interest togeth with the veri lawmak thei ar try to influenc __PUNCT__
thi is the poster child for what is wrong with polit todai __PUNCT__
politician try to have it both wai __PUNCT__ thei talk about chang the system __PUNCT__ but then conduct busi as usual __PUNCT__
the american peopl need a presid who will be straight with them __PUNCT__ who will be honest about the greatest challeng our govern face __PUNCT__
and on of the most import of those is the loom social secur crisi __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ senat clinton said she would just wait for thing to get better __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ she ha appar told some peopl that she realli support my idea of ask peopl who make more than __MONEY__ a year to contribut a littl more __PUNCT__
i don't believ open govern mean popular answer in public and honest candor in privat __PUNCT__
part of the reason the system is broken is that the special interest ar win mani fight behind the scene __PUNCT__ befor the american peopl ever hear about them __PUNCT__
just a few dai ago __PUNCT__ the hedg fund industri won a behind __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ scene war to kill a bill that would have plug a loophol that funnel billion of dollar into the pocket of some of the highest __PUNCT__ paid peopl in america __PUNCT__
the hedg fund industri hire more than __NUM__ lobbi firm __PUNCT__ corpor republican and corpor democrat __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ thei step up their campaign contribut __PUNCT__ to remind politician what thei would be miss if thei didn't plai along __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ congress drop the bill __PUNCT__ and left the loophol wide open __PUNCT__
thi happen all the time in washington __PUNCT__
measur that lobbyist oppos just fall off the schedul __PUNCT__
look at the debat over global warm __PUNCT__
earlier thi year __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ of the world top client scientist releas a report that conclud with at least __NUM__ percent certainti that global warm is happen __PUNCT__ and that man __PUNCT__ made greenhous gase ar a major caus __PUNCT__
thi is the same group that is share the nobel prize with vice presid al gore __PUNCT__
but the fact in their report were not the fact that the big oil compani want to hear __PUNCT__
so a conserv think tank fund by exxonmobil offer scientist __MONEY__ plu travel and other expens __PUNCT__ to undermin the fact in the report to politician on capitol hill __PUNCT__
it wa no wonder that the energi bill that pass congress did not includ a cap on greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__
ar you see a pattern here __PUNCT__ the american peopl want chang __PUNCT__
but the special interest see chang as a threat to their profit __PUNCT__
so thei hire lobbyist __PUNCT__ step up their campaign contribut __PUNCT__ and block the chang that peopl want __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ that the wai the game is plai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i sai it time we end thi game __PUNCT__
thi govern belong to the american peopl __PUNCT__
it time we put the power back in their hand __PUNCT__
that is why todai __PUNCT__ i am propos the on democraci initi __PUNCT__ to end the power of the special interest __PUNCT__ restor our democraci __PUNCT__ and start build on america __PUNCT__
the first thing we have to do is cut off special interest __PUNCT__ abil to influenc campaign with their monei __PUNCT__ and increas the power of regular peopl __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ ani individu can donat up to __MONEY__ to a campaign __PUNCT__
that mean candid ar spend their time glad __PUNCT__ hand with the tini fraction of american who can write a __MONEY__ check __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i would rewrit the rule to put small donor in charg by match the first __MONEY__ of donat at a rate of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ two __MONEY__ check will be worth the same as on __MONEY__ check __PUNCT__ and no on will be allow to give more than __MONEY__
but i will not stop there __PUNCT__
with all the monei that is flood into thi race __PUNCT__ you would think it wa an auction __PUNCT__ not an elect __PUNCT__
i have decid to take public financ __PUNCT__ which will help my campaign rais monei from small donor __PUNCT__ and make a statement about my independ from big donor __PUNCT__
thi is anoth place where senat clinton and i part wai __PUNCT__
we have both said we support the public financ of campaign as the best wai to get special interest monei out of our elect __PUNCT__
i have back up my word with action __PUNCT__ and challeng her to do the same __PUNCT__
she hasn't yet __PUNCT__ but i hope she will __PUNCT__
if she is not go to take public financ __PUNCT__ i believ the american peopl deserv to know why she sai she believ in the public financ system __PUNCT__ but will not particip in it __PUNCT__
unlik senat clinton __PUNCT__ i have also never taken a dime from feder lobbyist or polit action committe __PUNCT__ becaus i know that monei come with string attach __PUNCT__
i think that should be the rule __PUNCT__ not the except __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will prohibit all candid and feder offic holder from accept contribut from lobbyist __PUNCT__
all thi monei is make it extrem difficult for non __PUNCT__ wealthi candid to run __PUNCT__
i believ that a high __PUNCT__ school teacher here in keen __PUNCT__ or a nurs in manchest __PUNCT__ should have the same opportun to run for congress as a lawyer from north carolina __PUNCT__
i believ everyon should have the same chanc to run for offic as i had __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ the cost of even a congression campaign is climb into the million __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ our broken system help creat the percept that to run for offic __PUNCT__ you either need to be veri wealthi or will to be veri bought by the special interest __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will fix thi by creat a public financ option for congression candid that would give all candid equal budget and equal airtim __PUNCT__
that wai __PUNCT__ regular american just like the peopl in thi room can run for offic without have to cozi up to big contributor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we also need to restor confid in our democraci __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ everyon vote should count the same __PUNCT__
but after the vote __PUNCT__ count fiasco of recent year __PUNCT__ we need to reassur peopl that their vote will be count correctli __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will requir that all vote machin __PUNCT__ includ electron on __PUNCT__ us paper ballot that can be verifi by voter __PUNCT__
we also need to make sure that all of our citizen ar abl to particip in our democraci __PUNCT__ and have the represent thei deserv __PUNCT__
we need to end the disenfranchis of resid of washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ and give d.c __PUNCT__ resid a vote in congress __PUNCT__
we also need to end the disenfranchis of former prison who have serv their time __PUNCT__
and we need to end the voter suppress and intimid that ha been report in recent elect __PUNCT__
i believ in the wisdom of the american peopl __PUNCT__ and i think the more power thei have in our democraci __PUNCT__ the better our countri will be __PUNCT__
that why everi two year __PUNCT__ i will ask on million citizen to come togeth to tackl our toughest issu in local forum across the nation __PUNCT__
these citizen congress will combin old __PUNCT__ fashion town hall with __NUM__ centuri technolog __PUNCT__
thei will give regular american a chanc to speak to each other __PUNCT__ and to their elect offici in washington __PUNCT__ without the filter of interest group and the media __PUNCT__
like so much of what washington need __PUNCT__ thi idea of grassroot democraci is alreadi work out in the real world __PUNCT__ in town just like thi on __PUNCT__
right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ the portsmouth studi circl ha brought hundr of regular peopl togeth for over a decad to work out issu __PUNCT__ from school redistrict to end racial profil to the citi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year plan __PUNCT__
and the __DATE__ coalit is work to rais awar of local democraci and promot a new gener of citizen __PUNCT__ center work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that is the promis of our democraci __PUNCT__ that everydai __PUNCT__ hard __PUNCT__ work american and their famili can come togeth and exercis their democrat power to chang thi countri for the better __PUNCT__
but to give them that power __PUNCT__ we need to do more than just clean up our elect __PUNCT__
we also need to break the link between k street and capitol hill __PUNCT__
the bread and butter of wealthi lobbyist ar earmark __PUNCT__ take monei from the u. __PUNCT__ treasuri and send it directli to their client through spend bill __PUNCT__
top lobbyist earn million thi wai __PUNCT__
i will end that practic with a constitut version of the line __PUNCT__ item veto __PUNCT__ where the presid can requir an up or down vote on ani spend item he deem irrespons or inappropri we also need to close the revolv door between capitol hill and k street __PUNCT__
i will reinstat the five __PUNCT__ year ban on lobbi by former top govern offici __PUNCT__
presid bill clinton pass that ban __PUNCT__ but then he cancel it in hi last dai in offic __PUNCT__
i will reenact it by statut so no presid can rescind it again __PUNCT__
we also need to bar feder lobbyist from set polici over their former industri __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ there will be no more fox guard the henhous __PUNCT__
if you want to see whether anoth candid realli stand for chang __PUNCT__ ask them whether thei will do the same __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the wai washington is rush to do the bid of special interest these dai __PUNCT__ you would think that thei were the on that made america great __PUNCT__
but thei not __PUNCT__
the hard __PUNCT__ work men and women of america __PUNCT__ like the peopl in thi room __PUNCT__ ar the on who made thi countri great __PUNCT__
i talk a lot about what i will do as presid to fix the broken system in washington __PUNCT__
but you all have a role to plai in thi __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
the statu quo will onli continu if you let it __PUNCT__
it will continu if you look the other wai while peopl defend a system we all know is broken __PUNCT__
it will continu if you settl for replac a bunch of corpor republican with a bunch of corpor democrat __PUNCT__
the statu quo will continu if you let it __PUNCT__ but it will chang if you demand it __PUNCT__
that is why i am challeng you todai __PUNCT__ be vigil __PUNCT__
rememb that democraci doe not defend itself __PUNCT__
everi gener ha to fight to fulfil the promis of america __PUNCT__ of a nation where everyon is equal __PUNCT__ and the govern respond to the will of the peopl __PUNCT__
we ar the great nation we ar todai becaus the gener that went befor us stood up and fix our democraci when it wa broken __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ that respons fall on all of us __PUNCT__
my youngest daughter __PUNCT__ emma clair __PUNCT__ is __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
mani of you mai have children or grandchildren around that ag __PUNCT__
if we join togeth __PUNCT__ start todai __PUNCT__ and demand chang __PUNCT__ think about how differ thi countri could be by the time thei ar out of high school __PUNCT__
we could be live in an america where everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child is guarante high __PUNCT__ qualiti health care __PUNCT__
an america where we ar final work to halt global warm __PUNCT__ develop clean fuel and end our addict to foreign oil __PUNCT__
an america on the road to end poverti __PUNCT__ with the american dream becom a new realiti for million of hard __PUNCT__ work american __PUNCT__
an america where we have restor our moral leadership in the world __PUNCT__
but to reach that america tomorrow __PUNCT__ we need to rise to the challeng we face todai __PUNCT__
no matter what the cynic sai __PUNCT__ if we join togeth and fight for real chang __PUNCT__ we can restor our democraci __PUNCT__ and make our govern work again __PUNCT__
so don't settl for more of the same __PUNCT__
don't settl for a broken system that ignor your cri for chang __PUNCT__
