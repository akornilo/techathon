over the past few year __PUNCT__ i travel across thi countri and met with so mani honest __PUNCT__ hard work american __PUNCT__ includ mani right here in iowa __PUNCT__ who been left behind by our economi __PUNCT__
dure on of my trip a coupl of year ago __PUNCT__ i met doug bishop __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ doug work at the maytag plant in newton __PUNCT__
he work hard for maytag dai in and dai out __PUNCT__
and then maytag decid to cut cost by cut doug job __PUNCT__
doug wa lucki __PUNCT__
after eight month out of work __PUNCT__ he back on hi feet now __PUNCT__ a leader in hi commun __PUNCT__
but mani other peopl in newton __PUNCT__ and across america __PUNCT__ haven't been so lucki __PUNCT__
thei as eager to get back to work as doug wa __PUNCT__ but thei still struggl __PUNCT__
these peopl did everyth our countri ask of them __PUNCT__
everyth __PUNCT__
thei had job __PUNCT__ thei work hard at them __PUNCT__ and thei provid for their famili __PUNCT__ and in return __PUNCT__ thei got the rug pull out from under them __PUNCT__
who wa look out for these worker in newton __PUNCT__ who wa look out for their famili __PUNCT__ not maytag __PUNCT__
and certainli not anyon in washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__
it hasn't alwai been thi wai __PUNCT__
worker for gener were at the heart of our countri __PUNCT__
hard __PUNCT__ work men and women have made america the strongest __PUNCT__ most prosper nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ washington ha turn it back on our worker and their futur __PUNCT__
more than ever __PUNCT__ worker face an uncertain world where thei feel like no on in washington is do what thei can to help them __PUNCT__
thei right __PUNCT__
washington isn't look out for them __PUNCT__
washington is too busi look out for big busi and protect irrespons corpor __PUNCT__
trade ha becom a bad word for work american for a simpl reason __PUNCT__ our trade polici have been bad for work american __PUNCT__
washington look at everi trade deal and ask on question __PUNCT__ and onli on question __PUNCT__ is it good for corpor profit __PUNCT__ thei don't look at what it will do to worker __PUNCT__ to famili __PUNCT__ to wage __PUNCT__ to job __PUNCT__ or even to the economi __PUNCT__
when it come to trade __PUNCT__ the onli thing that matter in washington is the big busi bottom line __PUNCT__
and most of big busi is onli look out for it profit __PUNCT__ not it peopl __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ thei should be pai attent to a simpl truth __PUNCT__ corpor can be success and respons at the same time __PUNCT__
we need new trade polici in america that put worker __PUNCT__ wage and famili first __PUNCT__
not fourth __PUNCT__ not third __PUNCT__ not second __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__
what we need is trade without trade __PUNCT__ off __PUNCT__
trade without trade __PUNCT__ off for worker __PUNCT__
trade without trade __PUNCT__ off for job __PUNCT__
trade without trade __PUNCT__ off for the environ __PUNCT__
we need trade without trade __PUNCT__ off for america __PUNCT__
corpor __PUNCT__ and the execut who lead them __PUNCT__ need to realiz that creat american job is not onli the respons thing to do __PUNCT__ it the patriot thing to do __PUNCT__
but that certainli not what is happen todai __PUNCT__
america is bleed job __PUNCT__
sinc presid bush took offic __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million job have been lost to trade __PUNCT__ includ mani here in iowa __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ million more job mai move offshor within the next decad __PUNCT__
and don't let anyon tell you it just low __PUNCT__ skill job that we lose __PUNCT__ it also mani of our countri high qualiti servic and technolog job __PUNCT__ job that requir advanc educ such as in comput program __PUNCT__ radiolog __PUNCT__ call center __PUNCT__ and financi analysi __PUNCT__
but it doesn't begin or end with just the job be outsourc to china __PUNCT__ india and elsewher __PUNCT__
the neg effect from global ar rip through the economi __PUNCT__
global ha help stunt the growth in wage for american worker __PUNCT__
worker in america must now compet everi dai with worker oversea earn miser low wage with no benefit __PUNCT__
and what even wors __PUNCT__ big multin corpor now us the excus that thei have to ship ever more good __PUNCT__ pai american job oversea in order to compet with the veri low wage job thei themselv creat there __PUNCT__
in the last few year __PUNCT__ wage have fallen for nearli everi educ group __PUNCT__ all the wai up to master degre __PUNCT__ and corpor profit have nearli doubl __PUNCT__
rather than creat incom gain for all __PUNCT__ the gain from global ar mostli flow to the most fortun american __PUNCT__
global is a major reason why incom inequ is at it worst sinc befor the great depress __PUNCT__
it shouldn't be thi wai __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ i go to tell the lobbyist pull the string in washington and the big corpor that hire them the same thing __PUNCT__ their time is over __PUNCT__
the system is rig against regular american to guarante more power for the power and more wealth for the wealthi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i go to cut the rig down and end the game __PUNCT__
washington valu ar all wrong __PUNCT__ but the american peopl valu ar exactli right __PUNCT__
we believ in hard work __PUNCT__ fair and opportun __PUNCT__
just like we alwai have __PUNCT__
and we go to restor those valu to our economi and our govern __PUNCT__
i know the american peopl want chang __PUNCT__ real chang __PUNCT__
washington isn't work for them __PUNCT__
our economi isn't work for them __PUNCT__
but by unit togeth __PUNCT__ we can fix thi __PUNCT__
we can make sure that work and middl class famili again have the opportun to which thei entitl __PUNCT__
while ceo have been sit in their boardroom and while lobbyist and washington insid have been dine in their steakhous __PUNCT__ i have been on the ground __PUNCT__
meet worker __PUNCT__
walk picket line __PUNCT__
i walk past far too mani manufactur plant with lock on their gate and weed in their yard __PUNCT__
i heard firsthand from worker how thei on crisi awai __PUNCT__ on pink slip __PUNCT__ on trip to the emerg room __PUNCT__ from go over a cliff __PUNCT__
but i also seen firsthand their determin to fight __PUNCT__ for their famili and for our valu __PUNCT__
we need courag and convict and backbon to go up against these power lobbyist and insid __PUNCT__
half measur and babi step won't level the plai field __PUNCT__
triangul and compromis won't fix anyth __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but togeth __PUNCT__ you and me and everyon who is sick of listen to washington sai on thing and do anoth __PUNCT__ we can stand up and chang thi countri for the better __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and we certainli need chang __PUNCT__ especi in our trade polici __PUNCT__
for year now __PUNCT__ washington ha been pass trade deal after trade deal that work great for multin corpor __PUNCT__ but not for work american __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ nafta and the wto provid uniqu right for foreign compani whose profit ar allegedli hurt by environment and health regul __PUNCT__
these foreign compani have us them to demand compens for law against toxin __PUNCT__ mad cow diseas __PUNCT__ and gambl __PUNCT__ thei have even su the canadian postal servic for be a monopoli __PUNCT__
domest compani would get laugh out of court if thei tri thi __PUNCT__ but foreign investor can assert these special right in secret panel that oper outsid our system of law __PUNCT__
when economist sai that trade help our economi overal __PUNCT__ we need to be honest about the fact that it doe not help everyon __PUNCT__
the true measur of our economi isn't found onli in the size of our gdp or the level of corpor profit __PUNCT__ it whether middl class famili ar do better or wors __PUNCT__
a sure sign that our trade and econom polici ar serious out of whack is our trade deficit __PUNCT__
our nation import have increas by a stagger __NUM__ percent in the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and instead of a trade balanc __PUNCT__ the unit state now ha the largest trade deficit in the histori of the globe __PUNCT__ and it just keep grow __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ our current account deficit wa more than __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ which is a stagger __NUM__ percent of our nation entir gdp __PUNCT__ and our trade deficit with china alon wa __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
that mean that we ar consum billion of dollar more in import good than we produc __PUNCT__ and we ar borrow heavili to pai for them __PUNCT__
behind all these number and statist ar the face of million of american forgotten in our trade deal __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i can tell you that i will never forget them __PUNCT__
i saw what happen when the mill that my dad work in all hi life __PUNCT__ and that i work in myself when i wa young __PUNCT__ close and the job went somewher els __PUNCT__
it wasn't just devast to our commun econom __PUNCT__ it wa devast to the pride and digniti of the peopl who work hard everi dai try to make a better life for their kid __PUNCT__
let me tell you __PUNCT__ if a ceo think the right thing to do is to ship american job oversea __PUNCT__ to destroi famili and commun __PUNCT__ then i challeng him to go and look those worker in the ey and have the gut to tell them to their face that thei can't compet __PUNCT__
i stood with these worker all across america __PUNCT__ and let me tell you __PUNCT__ thei can compet __PUNCT__ becaus thei ar the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
the trade polici of presid bush have devast town and commun all across america __PUNCT__
but let be clear about someth __PUNCT__ thi isn't just hi do __PUNCT__
for far too long __PUNCT__ presid from both parti have enter into trade agreement __PUNCT__ agreement like nafta __PUNCT__ promis that thei would creat million of new job and enrich commun __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ too mani of these agreement have cost us job and devast mani of our town __PUNCT__
nafta wa written by insid in all three countri __PUNCT__ and it serv their interest __PUNCT__ not the interest of regular worker __PUNCT__
it includ unpreced right for corpor investor __PUNCT__ but no labor or environment protect in it core text __PUNCT__
and over the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we have seen grow incom inequ in the u. __PUNCT__ mexico and canada __PUNCT__
well enough is enough __PUNCT__
american have paid the price long enough __PUNCT__
we need to chang our fundament approach to trade __PUNCT__
we need to make american valu the foundat of our trade deal __PUNCT__ and we need to put worker back at their core __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ no on is ask for ani guarante __PUNCT__
america ha the most open economi in the world __PUNCT__ and no on is suggest that we put up tariff or go back to protection __PUNCT__
ani politician who promis to bring back the job we lost isn't tell the truth __PUNCT__ no on can bring back those job __PUNCT__
but with a level plai field __PUNCT__ american worker can compet with anybodi on earth __PUNCT__
and i absolut not suggest an end to trade __PUNCT__
i am call instead for an end to lip servic __PUNCT__
our leader in washington sai mani of the right thing __PUNCT__
thei even sai that thei will make sure the gain from trade ar share with everyon __PUNCT__
but when push come to shove __PUNCT__ the trade get push forward and the share get shove off __PUNCT__
we can and we must chang thi __PUNCT__
i believ we need to follow three principl to make sure global work for everyon __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ trade deal must benefit worker __PUNCT__ not just big multin corpor __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ our trade agreement ar negoti behind close door __PUNCT__
the multin get their sai __PUNCT__ but when on goe to congress it get an up or down vote __PUNCT__ no amend ar allow __PUNCT__
no wonder that corpor get uniqu protect __PUNCT__ while worker don't benefit __PUNCT__
that wrong __PUNCT__
imagin trade polici that actual put american worker first __PUNCT__
we need fair rule for worker __PUNCT__ and we need strong protect for labor and the environ and against currenc manipul __PUNCT__
if a deal is good for middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__ it good for america __PUNCT__ if it not __PUNCT__ it not __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ our trade polici should also lift up worker around the world __PUNCT__
thi struggl over fair trade is about more that just what at stake for america worker __PUNCT__ it also about what at stake for worker in everi countri __PUNCT__
make sure that worker around the globe ar treat fairli and share in trade gain is the right thing to do moral __PUNCT__ it the right thing to do econom __PUNCT__ and it will make us much safer and more secur __PUNCT__
that what strong labor standard ar all about __PUNCT__
make sure that worker have the right to organ and earn a fair wage will not onli prevent a __PUNCT__ race to the bottom __PUNCT__ on labor right __PUNCT__ it will also help build a global middl class that share in the gain from trade and creat market for u. __PUNCT__ export __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we need to address more than just our trade polici in order to restor fair and opportun to worker __PUNCT__
i talk earlier about some of the advers effect of global __PUNCT__ stagnant wage and rise inequ __PUNCT__
to help regular american get ahead and stai ahead __PUNCT__ we need to make sure our children get a qualiti educ and have the chanc to go to colleg __PUNCT__
we need to rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__ strengthen union __PUNCT__ and help famili build asset __PUNCT__
and the most import thing we can do to provid secur to our worker is to guarante univers health care in thi countri __PUNCT__
i am proud to be the first major candid to come out with a plan for univers health care __PUNCT__
we also need to invest resourc to ensur that our countri keep it competit edg in the world __PUNCT__
we need to creat the job of the futur right here in america and make sure our worker have the skill thei need to fill them __PUNCT__
we need to make the research and experiment tax credit perman __PUNCT__ invest in life scienc and biomed research __PUNCT__ strengthen math and scienc educ __PUNCT__ and creat a new energi economi __PUNCT__
there ar so mani thing we can do to put our economi back on the side of the work men and women who make thi countri great __PUNCT__
our trade polici have a huge impact on whether regular american __PUNCT__ in iowa and across the countri __PUNCT__ have the chanc to get ahead in our economi or whether thei ar left behind __PUNCT__
we need a new era in trade polici __PUNCT__
we need __PUNCT__ smart trade __PUNCT__ polici that american worker can sai ye to __PUNCT__ trade polici that do more than pai lip servic to their need and that actual make sure prosper is share __PUNCT__
trade polici that ar as innov as the american peopl __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ those ar the trade polici we will have __PUNCT__
and let me be clear __PUNCT__ we will make sure that these polici ar in place befor we pass a singl new trade deal __PUNCT__
in my first year in offic __PUNCT__ i will spend time work with congress to get our trade polici straight __PUNCT__ polici which ensur that american worker final begin to see benefit from the global economi __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ when we negoti new trade deal it won't just be big multin corpor whose interest ar serv __PUNCT__ it will also be the interest of american worker __PUNCT__ america commun __PUNCT__ and our global environ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ i will be a tough negoti on new trade deal __PUNCT__
there ar good trade deal and there ar bad trade deal __PUNCT__ and when i am presid it will be crystal clear that we have a presid who know the differ __PUNCT__
it is not enough for a trade deal to be popular on wall street or show up in econom statist __PUNCT__
my main measur is just thi on __PUNCT__ after consid the impact on job __PUNCT__ wage and price __PUNCT__ will most famili be better off __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ our trade agreement will give worker fair and level plai field __PUNCT__
all our trade partner must meet basic labor standard __PUNCT__ such as prohibit sweatshop and child labor and protect the right of worker to join union __PUNCT__
these condit should be the floor __PUNCT__ not the ceil __PUNCT__
and thei should not be in side agreement __PUNCT__ but at the core of the agreement __PUNCT__
i will tie unilater trade prefer and bilater trade agreement to progress on labor right __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will also push the world trade organ to begin to address labor standard __PUNCT__
and i will build on the preced of the cambodia textil agreement __PUNCT__ which reward progress on labor right with greater market access __PUNCT__
new trade agreement must also includ strong rule on environment protect and against currenc manipul __PUNCT__
as the world biggest custom __PUNCT__ our trade deal can be vital tool to ensur that progress is made in stop global warm __PUNCT__
thei can also be tool to ensur that poor environment practic do not creat unfair competit advantag __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i will insist that our trade deal be fairli and fulli administ __PUNCT__
for free trade to be fair __PUNCT__ it must be base on rule __PUNCT__ and then those rule must be follow __PUNCT__
but right now __PUNCT__ mani major u. __PUNCT__ trade partner ar break the rule without ani consequ __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will seek to restor america moral leadership of the world __PUNCT__ and our trade polici with these countri can help __PUNCT__
but we ar go to be tough in our negoti becaus the overrid oblig of the presid of the unit state is to put america worker __PUNCT__ economi and nation interest first __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ china __PUNCT__ india and certain other nation ar each __PUNCT__ to on degre or anoth __PUNCT__ combin miser low wage and poor environment practic with tax break __PUNCT__ subsidi __PUNCT__ tariff __PUNCT__ low __PUNCT__ cost loan __PUNCT__ and currenc manipul to advanc their trade at the expens of our __PUNCT__
all of thi is cost american high __PUNCT__ qualiti job and threaten million more __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ restor fair and balanc trade with china will be a particular prioriti __PUNCT__
it massiv manipul of the yuan ha continu for year __PUNCT__ give it an unfair advantag against u. __PUNCT__ manufactur __PUNCT__ and it labor and intellectu properti protect ar grossli inadequ __PUNCT__
as a result of the massiv trade deficit we run with china __PUNCT__ the largest ever between ani two countri __PUNCT__ more than __MONEY__ billion last year alon __PUNCT__ china now own __MONEY__ trillion in u. __PUNCT__ asset __PUNCT__ give it great leverag over our economi and our secur __PUNCT__
thi is not accept __PUNCT__
we need to persuad china authoritarian govern to commit to the rule that govern the conduct of respons nation __PUNCT__
our trade polici ar a great opportun for increas leverag over china __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ when i presid i will make it crystal clear that do busi with china should not come at the expens of american job or our economi __PUNCT__ there must and will be balanc between our nation when we trade __PUNCT__
as for our good friend india __PUNCT__ which ha achiev remark econom growth in recent year __PUNCT__ we still must work hard to get it to adher to both the letter and the spirit of it trade agreement with the u. __PUNCT__ and to further achiev our share valu __PUNCT__ while all the while improv the live of it million of citizen __PUNCT__
i know follow the letter of ani law __PUNCT__ let alon trade law __PUNCT__ isn't a prioriti for the bush administr __PUNCT__ but it will be for mine __PUNCT__
in the edward administr __PUNCT__ the top prosecutor at the depart of justic will be respons for enforc our trade agreement __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the trade negoti charg with enforc agreement seem to think their job is done when an agreement is sign __PUNCT__
sign a trade deal should be the begin of the process __PUNCT__ not the end __PUNCT__
and i will insist that we final begin to prosecut illeg foreign subsidi __PUNCT__ currenc manipul __PUNCT__ and trade practic __PUNCT__
fair term of trade also mean fix our own tax code so that corpor aren't reward for close plant and ship job to countri like china __PUNCT__
our govern should be encourag busi to invest here __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ on of the starkest exampl that our economi work best for big busi instead of regular american is that we actual give tax incent to compani to invest oversea __PUNCT__
american compani set up shop in tax haven often pai littl or no u. __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__
thi is not onli wrong __PUNCT__ it unpatriot __PUNCT__
i will elimin the tax incent that encourag compani to invest oversea rather than here at home __PUNCT__
these dollar __PUNCT__ if invest in new facil and in retrain worker and rebuild devast commun __PUNCT__ can fuel a dramat expans of our own economi __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we need much more invest in help the worker and commun left behind __PUNCT__
when we sign a trade deal __PUNCT__ we know which industri and worker will like be affect by greater competit __PUNCT__
we need to restor some honesti to the trade debat and not claim __PUNCT__ like too mani presid from both parti have done __PUNCT__ that trade will help everyon __PUNCT__
thi is simpli not true __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ everi trade agreement will be subject to not onli an econom assess show how import and export will be affect by the agreement __PUNCT__ but also to a __PUNCT__ commun impact assess __PUNCT__
we need to make sure trade deal produc real benefit that ar wide share __PUNCT__ and we need to get a head start on help ani worker and commun who will be hurt by increas in import or by competit from other countri __PUNCT__
befor i ask congress to approv ani new trade agreement __PUNCT__ we will have an honest discuss about the real impact of that agreement on town and commun and worker across our countri __PUNCT__
then we can go into disloc commun __PUNCT__ start befor the job ar gone __PUNCT__ and help them diversifi their economi with initi model on the militari base close commiss __PUNCT__ bring local leader __PUNCT__ employ and union togeth to rebuild local economi __PUNCT__
we need to be much more aggress about help worker and affect commun __PUNCT__
train is no substitut for good trade polici __PUNCT__ but we must help worker gain new skill and get ahead __PUNCT__
the problem is that __PUNCT__ too often __PUNCT__ train program ar complet disconnect from the job market __PUNCT__
i will creat a broad new train work program that ti retrain to real job __PUNCT__
it will support on __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ job train program through partnership among busi __PUNCT__ union and commun colleg __PUNCT__
worker will be train on __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ job to make sure the job actual exist __PUNCT__
and to make it worth busi __PUNCT__ while __PUNCT__ and to support high __PUNCT__ wage job __PUNCT__ we will pai part of worker __PUNCT__ wage while thei ar be train __PUNCT__
all type of worker ar affect by global __PUNCT__ and all type of worker should be elig for help get back on their feet __PUNCT__
but trade adjust assist __PUNCT__ or taa __PUNCT__ now onli help manufactur worker at plant close __PUNCT__
becaus most unemploi worker who lose their job aren't even cover by unemploy insur __PUNCT__ i will help state modern their program __PUNCT__
thi will give secur to __NUM__ more jobless worker a year __PUNCT__ includ more low __PUNCT__ wage and part __PUNCT__ time worker __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as we have seen over the last year __PUNCT__ anoth dark side of trade is the concern over the safeti of the food we eat __PUNCT__ the toi our children plai with __PUNCT__ and even the medicin we take __PUNCT__
now more than ever __PUNCT__ we need to make sure that our trade rule protect american consum __PUNCT__
food import have doubl in the past decad __PUNCT__ and american now eat three __PUNCT__ quarter of a pound of import food everi dai __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ less than __NUM__ percent of import food is inspect __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will enforc mandatori __PUNCT__ countri of origin __PUNCT__ label for food and other consum product so that american will know who is make the product thei ar bui __PUNCT__
the big meat packer have block thi law for too long __PUNCT__
i will give the fda all the author and resourc it need to keep taint food and product out of our countri and out of our home __PUNCT__
we will strengthen enforc to ensur that safeti standard ar be met __PUNCT__ and we will enforc __PUNCT__ zero toler __PUNCT__ and immedi freez the specif import of ani food __PUNCT__ toi __PUNCT__ medicin __PUNCT__ or other good that threaten the health of our children and famili __PUNCT__
we will not let them in until we know thei ar safe __PUNCT__ becaus the health and welfar of our children ar more import than cheap toi __PUNCT__
we must make sure that trade is not onli smart and good for america economi and worker __PUNCT__ but safe for american famili __PUNCT__
regular famili __PUNCT__ their safeti and their best interest __PUNCT__ should come befor the interest of multin corpor __PUNCT__
that what safe and smart trade is about __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ some peopl as thei listen to my new smart trade vision for america will accus me of be a protectionist or anti __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__
thei would be wrong __PUNCT__
i believ in smart and safe trade __PUNCT__ just not trade that help american multin but hurt america __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ you can protect the interest of american worker and still trade __PUNCT__
we can grow our economi __PUNCT__ and creat good job and trade respons __PUNCT__ fairli and safe __PUNCT__
with smart trade polici __PUNCT__ we can make sure american worker compet on level plai field __PUNCT__
with smart trade polici __PUNCT__ we can creat a new futur where even more worker and their famili have a chanc to achiev the american dream __PUNCT__
i know we can make trade and our economi work for regular worker __PUNCT__ but real chang must first begin with end __PUNCT__ onc and for all __PUNCT__ the influenc lobbyist have on trade polici and on our govern __PUNCT__
it time washington work for the american peopl __PUNCT__ not for lobbyist and insid __PUNCT__
it time that the presid stood up and fought for american worker __PUNCT__
it time to have a presid that alwai __PUNCT__ alwai __PUNCT__ put the interest of the american peopl first __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ i again call on all feder officehold and candid from all polit parti to join me in put an end to the monei game in washington by simpli refus to accept ani form of campaign donat from feder lobbyist go forward __PUNCT__
it realli just that simpl __PUNCT__
we need to send a messag to all of the lobbyist in washington __PUNCT__ your monei is no good here __PUNCT__ and we not go to take it anymor __PUNCT__
we don't need you __PUNCT__ we got the american peopl on our side __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ what i just said todai isn't go to be popular with the special interest group __PUNCT__ lobbyist or washington insid __PUNCT__
but thi isn't about be well __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__
thi is about do what right __PUNCT__
thei go to try to distract you and me from the issu that matter __PUNCT__ issu like health care __PUNCT__ poverti __PUNCT__ job and econom fair __PUNCT__
and it these insid in washington who ar go to attack us to try to keep peopl like me from speak out __PUNCT__ but thei won't succe __PUNCT__
becaus i go to fight with everi breath i have __PUNCT__
becaus thi isn't about me or them __PUNCT__ it about you __PUNCT__ your famili __PUNCT__ your children __PUNCT__ and how those who run for presid ar go to fight for real chang to creat a better america where all of us can go as far as our hard work and god __PUNCT__ given talent will take us __PUNCT__
that the kind of presid i will be __PUNCT__
as harri truman said __PUNCT__ the ultim test of ani presidenti decis is __PUNCT__ not whether it popular at the time __PUNCT__ but whether it right __PUNCT__ if it right __PUNCT__ make it __PUNCT__ and let the popular part take care of itself __PUNCT__
we know we don't have to live in an america where hard __PUNCT__ work men and women ar struggl to get by __PUNCT__
where we pass trade deal after trade deal that rip apart commun __PUNCT__
where good peopl like those who work at maytag do right by their countri and ar still left out in the cold __PUNCT__
that not our america __PUNCT__
our america sai if you work hard __PUNCT__ you have the chanc to get ahead and leav your kid a better life __PUNCT__
that the on america we fight for __PUNCT__
that our america __PUNCT__
and togeth __PUNCT__ i know we can make our on america a realiti becaus the real power of america isn't in washington __PUNCT__ it with the american peopl __PUNCT__
it with all of you __PUNCT__
and that is why when i presid __PUNCT__ real chang is come __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__
god bless america __PUNCT__
