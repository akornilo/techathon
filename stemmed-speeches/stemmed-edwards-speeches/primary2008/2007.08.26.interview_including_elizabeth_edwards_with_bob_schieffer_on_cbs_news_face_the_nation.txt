schieffer __PUNCT__ and good morn again __PUNCT__
we ar here with senat and mr __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
she is plai a major role in thi campaign __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ your book is now out in paperback __PUNCT__
you have ad a new chapter detail how you found out that your cancer had come back __PUNCT__ and that it wa here to stai just as john edward wa start hi campaign __PUNCT__
so i have to ask you at the begin __PUNCT__ how ar you feel __PUNCT__ and how your health these dai __PUNCT__ ms __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ i feel great __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ still have no symptom __PUNCT__ which is a veri good sign __PUNCT__
my protocol is easi to work around a campaign schedul __PUNCT__ and the medic i take don't tire me __PUNCT__
honestli __PUNCT__ if you didn't know i had cancer __PUNCT__ you wouldn't know i had cancer __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ she seem to feel great __PUNCT__
she energet and out there campaign and speak her mind __PUNCT__
so i proud of her __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that for sure __PUNCT__
and we want to talk to you about that __PUNCT__ and the role you plai in thi campaign in just a bit __PUNCT__
but first i want to talk to senat edward about some of the most current thing that ar happen __PUNCT__
iraq and terror continu to hang over thi campaign and over american life __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ and last week senat clinton said that __PUNCT__ she rais the possibl of a terrorist attack __PUNCT__ and said __PUNCT__ should that happen __PUNCT__ it would give the republican an advantag __PUNCT__ and it would __PUNCT__ and she said she would be the best person __PUNCT__ if that happen __PUNCT__ to be in charg of that situat __PUNCT__ as it were __PUNCT__
you came down pretti hard on her __PUNCT__
you said she wa make a polit calcul about terror __PUNCT__
why did you sai that __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ there ar a coupl thing that we just disagre about __PUNCT__ with all respect to senat clinton __PUNCT__ who a __PUNCT__ who a great candid for presid __PUNCT__
first is __PUNCT__ i don't agre that the republican would have an advantag __PUNCT__
i would never cede that __PUNCT__
i think we ar __PUNCT__ and thi is anoth issu that we disagre about __PUNCT__ i think we less safe __PUNCT__ not more safe __PUNCT__
we have fewer alli __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ accord to bush own state depart __PUNCT__ there ar more terrorist in the world __PUNCT__
so i think we ar not safer than we were when georg bush took offic __PUNCT__ or just prior to __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and the second issu is __PUNCT__ i think when you talk about someth as seriou as an attack on the unit state of america __PUNCT__ particularli if you a presidenti candid or a presid __PUNCT__ the focu should not be on polit and on vote __PUNCT__ the focu should be on what go to have to be done to unit america to keep the american peopl safe __PUNCT__
so that what i wa talk about __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ in the new thi morn __PUNCT__ prime minist maliki said thi morn that democrat in the unit state who have been call for hi resign __PUNCT__ he said thei ar treat america as if __PUNCT__ or treat iraq as if it wa somehow on of america villag __PUNCT__ as he put it __PUNCT__ and he said it is time to start talk about iraq with more respect __PUNCT__
ani thought on that __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ i think that maliki should quit worri about democrat and the presidenti campaign in america and start worri about what he need to do in hi own countri __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ everyon know that __PUNCT__ at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ the iraq studi group ha said __PUNCT__ and most of us have said at thi point __PUNCT__ there can be no militari solut in iraq __PUNCT__
there ha to be a polit solut __PUNCT__
there ha to be some compromis between maliki and the shia __PUNCT__ led govern and the sunni leadership __PUNCT__
otherwis there never be stabil and secur in iraq __PUNCT__
and maliki __PUNCT__ who ha been __PUNCT__ clearli __PUNCT__ a weak leader __PUNCT__ need to be focus on that job __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ do you think he ought to step asid __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think that someth for them to decid __PUNCT__ not for us to decid __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ the real test is __PUNCT__ ar thei move toward a polit compromis __PUNCT__
becaus there cannot be stabil in iraq without it __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ do you think thei ar __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ i can't __PUNCT__ if there ani differ __PUNCT__ i can't see it __PUNCT__
and i know that we go __PUNCT__ petraeu is go to come forward with hi report in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and i think the __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ at least from my perspect __PUNCT__ the test in that report should not just be what happen with the militari and what happen with the situat with violenc on the ground __PUNCT__ the question is __PUNCT__ ha __PUNCT__ dure thi surg __PUNCT__ ha there been ani chang in the polit situat __PUNCT__
and how long ar we go to be will to keep troop on the ground at thi level if there no seriou movement toward a polit compromis __PUNCT__
i think that should be the test for thi report that come __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when the senat and the hous come back into session at the end of the summer here __PUNCT__ the first thing thei go to have to deal with is what to do about iraq __PUNCT__ fund the war __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ you see even some democrat __PUNCT__ like senat clinton __PUNCT__ to go back to senat clinton __PUNCT__ sai it look like that mayb the surg is work in the sens that there is less violenc there __PUNCT__
what do you think the senat should do here __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i know you have said that you like to immedi draw down about __NUM__ troop there __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ __URL__ then work from there and eventu get all of them out __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ do you think that in ani wai a possibl __PUNCT__ or is the presid go to be abl to ride thi out __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think there actual a mandat from america __PUNCT__ regardless of what i think __PUNCT__
i think america said veri clearli in the __DATE__ elect that thei want a veri differ cours in iraq __PUNCT__ and i think the congress ha a respons under that mandat __PUNCT__ and i think thei should stand their ground __PUNCT__
i think thei should not submit a singl fund bill to the presid for the war that doesn't have a timet for withdraw __PUNCT__
and i think thei should us whatev legisl tool is avail to them __PUNCT__ includ filibust __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ includ a filibust __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ includ a filibust __PUNCT__
to do everyth __PUNCT__ thi is not polit __PUNCT__
thi is about life and death __PUNCT__
we have men and women dy in iraq __PUNCT__ and thei dy in part becaus of what we __PUNCT__ what we talk about a few minut ago __PUNCT__
becaus the sunni __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ senat warner __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ perhap the most influenti and respect voic on nation secur on the republican side __PUNCT__ said last week that it is time to start bring home at least __PUNCT__ he said pick a number __PUNCT__ but at least __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and he sai no timet __PUNCT__ he doesn't think that wise to set a timet __PUNCT__ but he did sai it time to start the withdraw __PUNCT__
what about that __PUNCT__ do you think that __PUNCT__ you think thei should go beyond that __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think we should go beyond that __PUNCT__ but i glad to see that senat warner __PUNCT__ have just appar come back from iraq __PUNCT__ is see what most of america is see __PUNCT__ which is the real test here is we have to shift the respons to the iraqi __PUNCT__
thei have got to feel the heat __PUNCT__
and thei got to start move on polit compromis __PUNCT__
it that simpl __PUNCT__
and the threshold question is __PUNCT__ how do you shift that respons __PUNCT__ how do you intensifi pressur on them __PUNCT__
and we can't do that until we start take troop out of iraq __PUNCT__ which i think is exactli what senat warner sai __PUNCT__
i go far beyond what he suggest __PUNCT__ but the truth of the matter is __PUNCT__ we have to start take troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you were on face the nation __PUNCT__ and i ask you what would happen if the administr took your advic __PUNCT__ did exactli what you sai we ought to do __PUNCT__
what did you think would happen __PUNCT__ and you said __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__
and i rememb ask you at the time __PUNCT__ can you run for presid and sai you don't know what would happen if the administr doe what you sai that it should do __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't think anybodi who suggest to america __PUNCT__ and america ha been misl and misl about thi war __PUNCT__ and thei sick of it __PUNCT__
thei want the truth __PUNCT__
the truth is there ar no good choic and no on can predict with ani kind of accuraci exactli what go to happen in iraq __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ if i were presid of the unit state todai __PUNCT__ i would do what you suggest earlier __PUNCT__ but i would also be veri open and forthright with the american peopl __PUNCT__ that we cannot predict what go to happen __PUNCT__
we go to maxim the chanc of success __PUNCT__ we go to do thi in an orderli and respons wai __PUNCT__ but there no wai to know with certainti what will happen __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ but even if it meant a __PUNCT__ some sort of a region conflict that broke out that brought other peopl in the middl east into it __PUNCT__ you sai we have to take that risk to get our peopl out of there __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think we __PUNCT__ i think we actual maxim the chanc for success by start to draw down troop in iraq __PUNCT__
i think that what it doe is it shift the respons to them __PUNCT__ and there at least some opportun for them to reach some compromis __PUNCT__
i think we should __PUNCT__ in combin with do that __PUNCT__ we should engag the iranian and the syrian who have a clear interest in a stabl iraq __PUNCT__ particularli if america no longer occupi iraq __PUNCT__
we do have to __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__ prepar for the other possibl __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i would maintain a presenc in the region __PUNCT__ we have an obviou interest in the region __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ we probabl need to be beef up our presenc in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we need a naval presenc in the persian gulf __PUNCT__ probabl need a rapid deploy forc in kuwait __PUNCT__
mayb should stage some troop in __PUNCT__ station some troop in jordan if we could get stage author from the jordanian govern __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ we come back and talk about thi some more __PUNCT__ and elizabeth edward __PUNCT__ role in thi campaign when we come back in on minut __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ announc __PUNCT__ schieffer __PUNCT__ and we back with john and elizabeth edward __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i want to talk to you a littl bit about the role that seem to be develop for you in thi campaign __PUNCT__ and it is most unusu __PUNCT__
some peopl ar call you the attack in chief __PUNCT__
other sai that we never had a candid wife who been put in charg of the tough stuff __PUNCT__
usual thei ar __PUNCT__ thei ar brought into the campaign to talk about the softer side __PUNCT__
but yet __PUNCT__ you call senat obama __PUNCT__ holier than thou __PUNCT__
you have said senat clinton is not do a good job on present health care __PUNCT__
when someon ask why senat obama and senat clinton were get so much public __PUNCT__ you said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ john is not black and he is not a woman __PUNCT__ and there noth we can do about that __PUNCT__
do you feel __PUNCT__ as a woman __PUNCT__ that you can sai thing in the campaign that perhap senat edward cannot sai __PUNCT__ ms __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ none of thi is calcul in ani wai __PUNCT__
i have alwai been realli forthright __PUNCT__
i think if i have ani valu in the campaign __PUNCT__ everyon know i support my husband __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ shock new __PUNCT__
ms __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ but my valu is that peopl trust me __PUNCT__ thei trust me to sai what on my mind and to be direct __PUNCT__
and i answer question __PUNCT__
i answer question about why it is john us the internet so heavili __PUNCT__
i think it partli becaus the mainstream media is involv with an obvious interest stori between a man of african __PUNCT__ american heritag and a woman candid __PUNCT__
these ar __PUNCT__ that an interest stori __PUNCT__
if he want to get hi polici across __PUNCT__ he need to find someplac other than mainstream media __PUNCT__ todai except __PUNCT__ to get that messag across __PUNCT__
and it wasn't meant in ani wai to be derogatori of __PUNCT__ even of the press __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ do you think __PUNCT__ do you think in some wai that the whole dynam of thi campaign ha chang becaus we do have a woman who lead in the poll now __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ ha that chang the wai you campaign __PUNCT__ ms __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't think it doe __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ i think you have to campaign with blinder on in a certain respect __PUNCT__
my idea is __PUNCT__ my purpos __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ is to talk about john polici __PUNCT__
he give me an incred buffet from which to speak __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the first person on health care __PUNCT__ the first person on environment __PUNCT__ the onli person with a rural polici __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a realli aggress posit with respect to iraq __PUNCT__
i got a lot of thing i can talk about out there __PUNCT__ and honestli __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ except when ask __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__ i don't refer the differ between john vote on dedic fund for iraq and senat obama __PUNCT__ or john health care program and senat clinton __PUNCT__
i don't __PUNCT__ i don't volunt these __PUNCT__ but when ask __PUNCT__ i try to be trustworthi __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__ i rememb __PUNCT__ i rememb on time that ann coulter __PUNCT__ the republican activist and author __PUNCT__
ms __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ __URL__ tear hi hide off on __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ chri matthew __PUNCT__ show __PUNCT__
and you just pick up the phone and call __PUNCT__ and said __PUNCT__ hei __PUNCT__
ms __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ but that ha to do with __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ as a mother __PUNCT__ honestli __PUNCT__ at __PUNCT__ sometim i been pretti disturb about the trend in the polit dialogu __PUNCT__
if we argu about polici __PUNCT__ and i sai __PUNCT__ somebodi health care polici doesn't do thi __PUNCT__ and somebodi __PUNCT__ and john doe do __PUNCT__ doe do what miss __PUNCT__ that differ than call __PUNCT__ than name call __PUNCT__
and that denigr the whole process __PUNCT__
turn peopl off __PUNCT__ we have less peopl vote __PUNCT__ and it realli import to get those peopl engag becaus we can't __PUNCT__ thi is the wrong wai for us to go __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ let me talk to both of you about what you __PUNCT__ if you should becom presid __PUNCT__ what you envis the role of the first ladi to be __PUNCT__
i rememb when senat clinton decid to run for the senat __PUNCT__ i think she had a new confer __PUNCT__ or she said someplac __PUNCT__ i go to have to put my first ladi duti asid now __PUNCT__ becaus i go to go run for the senat __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ anybodi who look at the constitut know that the first ladi ha no duti assign __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ it isn't an elect offic in ani wai __PUNCT__
what role would elizabeth plai in your administr if you were elect __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ she the person i trust most in the world __PUNCT__ so i mean __PUNCT__ i would care __PUNCT__ we talk about everyth __PUNCT__
we talk about everyth person to us __PUNCT__ our famili __PUNCT__ our respons to our kid __PUNCT__
and we talk about my view and her view on nation polici __PUNCT__
on most thing we agre __PUNCT__ on some thing we don't agre __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ gai marriag __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ that is an exampl __PUNCT__
and i think that there __PUNCT__ i want __PUNCT__ but i care what she sai __PUNCT__ and i want to hear what she sai __PUNCT__
so she would be somebodi that i would talk to __PUNCT__ and would __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__

i have also known __PUNCT__ over year of cover capitol hill __PUNCT__ member of congress who made their wive chief of staff __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__

edward __PUNCT__ that true __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ would she ever be in charg of a program __PUNCT__ or would she be in charg of initi __PUNCT__ would you want to __PUNCT__ elizabeth __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i let her speak to it __PUNCT__
let me sai on thing about it __PUNCT__

i think that the wai we do thing __PUNCT__ and the wai we interact __PUNCT__ it so natur that i would not want to chang that __PUNCT__
i think titl and specif charg is not the wai that we do thing togeth __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ becaus of that __PUNCT__ it doesn't make sens __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there mai be thing that she ha a particular interest in __PUNCT__ and i let her speak for herself on that __PUNCT__
but i think what she ha done dure the cours of the campaign __PUNCT__ be honest __PUNCT__ be forthright __PUNCT__ be strong __PUNCT__ i person respect __PUNCT__ and i applaud her for it __PUNCT__
and she will continu to do that __PUNCT__ as she ha the entir __NUM__ year that we been marri __PUNCT__
