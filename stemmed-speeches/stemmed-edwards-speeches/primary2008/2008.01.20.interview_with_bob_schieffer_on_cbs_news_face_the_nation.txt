schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ let me ask you thi __PUNCT__
do you think thi ha less to do with you and more to do with just histor forc __PUNCT__ that you just sort of had the bad luck to run for presid on the year when you have the first woman to be serious consid as elect to the presid run along with the first african __PUNCT__ american to be serious consid as elect __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ do i think that a factor __PUNCT__ of cours it a factor __PUNCT__
there no doubt about that __PUNCT__
and we got a coupl of candid who gotten massiv public and rais __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__ plu each __PUNCT__
but i not in the busi of make excus __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
not about nevada __PUNCT__ not about the campaign __PUNCT__
all three of us ar go to be perfectli fine when thi thing over __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ will we have done what need to be done for america __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ ar we go to do what ha to be done to preserv the middl class and help low incom famili and help singl mom who have no health insur and bring thi war to an end __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ that what thi is about __PUNCT__
it not about ani of __PUNCT__ ani of us person __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ but the poll in nevada yesterdai seem to suggest that senat clinton wa the on who could do those kind of thing __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ here you had these big labor union endors senat obama __PUNCT__ and yet she carri union household when ask who the candid with exactli the right experi __PUNCT__
she just swamp everybodi in the field on that __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ what is it about your messag __PUNCT__ why can't you get your messag out __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ for all the reason you just talk about __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
and first of all __PUNCT__ congratul to senat clinton __PUNCT__
she should be congratul for what happen in nevada __PUNCT__
but she and senat obama have both spent massiv amount of monei there __PUNCT__ put a massiv effort into the __PUNCT__ into the state __PUNCT__
we didn't run a singl radio or televis ad __PUNCT__
but the excus ar meaningless __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ what matter here is what go to happen for the countri __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ senat clinton and senat obama both get an enorm amount of attent __PUNCT__ as thei have from over a year ago __PUNCT__ but i think the kei for me is to keep fight for what it is i believ in __PUNCT__
it what i done __PUNCT__ i __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__ i been do thi all my life __PUNCT__ and i certainli not go to stop now __PUNCT__ fight for the peopl that i fight for __PUNCT__
and that exactli what i go to do here in south carolina __PUNCT__ and thi is a place i know veri well __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what exactli is your strategi here __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ ar you try to hang around to hope for a broker convent __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ it seem to me somewher along the wai you got to win a primari here __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ of cours i do __PUNCT__ there no question about that __PUNCT__
but thi is a long process __PUNCT__
as much __PUNCT__ as much as the media like to think that all of america is obsess with what happen in nevada or in iowa or in new hampshir __PUNCT__ we had three state vote so far out of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we got __NUM__ left to vote __PUNCT__
and if you take thi as __PUNCT__ in a long view __PUNCT__ which i do __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i season to thi __PUNCT__ i been through it befor __PUNCT__ you know that there ar lot of up and down in these campaign __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i see __PUNCT__ i just heard you announc senat mccain victori in south carolina __PUNCT__
the nation media had written him off four or five month ago __PUNCT__ said he wa dead __PUNCT__ had no chanc __PUNCT__
i heard it over and over and over __PUNCT__ and all of a sudden he now the republican front __PUNCT__ runner __PUNCT__
i just tell you thi is a long process __PUNCT__ and thi is go to go on for a while __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ in a strategi memo that wa __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ leak __PUNCT__ and a lot of the new media pick up on __PUNCT__ you refer to senat clinton and senat obama as the celebr candid __PUNCT__ and you also talk about senat obama be too weak to stand up to the republican and senat clinton be too corpor __PUNCT__
what do you mean by those character __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ let me just sai about each of them __PUNCT__ thei both veri good candid __PUNCT__
there a reason that thei ar where thei ar __PUNCT__
it not an accid __PUNCT__
and thei deserv credit for it __PUNCT__
thei have gotten an enorm amount of attent __PUNCT__ but thei run veri good campaign __PUNCT__ both of them __PUNCT__
i think there ar differ in the approach that each on of us take to thi race __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ is more the old style __PUNCT__ washington work the wai it doe __PUNCT__ and it ok to take the monei from the lobbyist and the special interest pac __PUNCT__ which i never done __PUNCT__ and i proud of __PUNCT__
senat obama __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ha a lot of __PUNCT__ a lot of great idea __PUNCT__ and he doe believ in chang __PUNCT__
i believ he believ in chang __PUNCT__
he believ in it deepli __PUNCT__
but he ha what i would describ as a more academ approach to it than i do __PUNCT__
i think if you go to bring about chang you have to be will to fight for that chang __PUNCT__ that it not go to happen unless you will to take on these monei interest __PUNCT__
so i think each of us have a veri differ perspect on how we do what need to be done for america __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ some peopl in the clinton campaign ar tell me privat thi morn thei now believ that thi thing will be wrap up on super tuesdai __PUNCT__
why do you believ that not so __PUNCT__ or do you __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i have __PUNCT__ thi __PUNCT__ we have a long wai to go __PUNCT__
and we got a primari in south carolina thi saturdai __PUNCT__
there no wai __PUNCT__ the on thing we know from all the poll and everyth els __PUNCT__ from these first three contest __PUNCT__ is these race ar enorm unpredict __PUNCT__
and that certainli true here in south carolina __PUNCT__
and then we go to __DATE__ __PUNCT__ where there state all over the countri __PUNCT__ big state __PUNCT__ like new york __PUNCT__ california __PUNCT__ but there also a lot of other state __PUNCT__ oklahoma __PUNCT__ kansa __PUNCT__ there a whole group of state up from all across america that in mani wai repres the cross __PUNCT__ section of america __PUNCT__
and what we need to think about is __PUNCT__ as a parti __PUNCT__ is who ar we go to put up against who now look like it mai be john mccain on the other side __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thi is a gui who a great advoc for campaign financ reform __PUNCT__
so ar we go to put a candid against him who taken in lot of monei from lobbyist and pac __PUNCT__ and he also a veri strong candid __PUNCT__ with a long __PUNCT__ long record __PUNCT__ includ an extraordinari record of militari servic __PUNCT__
so he will be strong __PUNCT__
and we have to put up somebodi who strong against him and somebodi who repres chang in a meaning wai __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ do you think thi controversi that broke out over __PUNCT__ basic __PUNCT__ over race between senat clinton and senat obama is over __PUNCT__ or will that come back __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't know the answer to the __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__ that a good question __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
i don't know the answer to that __PUNCT__
i sure hope it over __PUNCT__
it not good for my parti __PUNCT__ and i think much more import than that __PUNCT__ as much as i love the democrat parti __PUNCT__ it not good for america __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i grew up in the south in the __PUNCT__ 50 and __PUNCT__ 60 __PUNCT__ and i seen __PUNCT__ i seen too much of thi __PUNCT__
and i want to see us continu __PUNCT__ we made progress __PUNCT__ we still have huge work to do on issu of race and equal in thi countri __PUNCT__
but we shouldn't be stir histor problem __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ what we ought to be do is move thi countri forward on thi issu __PUNCT__
it a veri import thing for america __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ on quick question __PUNCT__
if you do not do well in south carolina __PUNCT__ do you plan to go on to super tuesdai __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
absolut __PUNCT__
i said over and over i am commit to thi __PUNCT__
my caus ha not gone awai __PUNCT__ and i in it for the long haul __PUNCT__
