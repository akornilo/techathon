mani of you know that i am the son of a mill worker __PUNCT__ that i rose from modest mean and have been bless in so mani wai in life __PUNCT__
elizabeth and i have so much to be grate for __PUNCT__
and all of you know about some of the challeng we have face in my famili __PUNCT__
but there came a time __PUNCT__ a few month ago __PUNCT__ when elizabeth and i had to decid __PUNCT__ in the quiet of a hospit room __PUNCT__ after mani hour of test and get pretti bad new __PUNCT__ what we were go to do with our live __PUNCT__
and we made our decis __PUNCT__
that we were not go to go quietli into the night __PUNCT__ that we were go to stand and fight for what we believ in __PUNCT__
as elizabeth and i have campaign across america __PUNCT__ i come to a better understand of what that decis realli meant __PUNCT__ and why we made it __PUNCT__
earlier thi year __PUNCT__ i spoke at riversid church in new york __PUNCT__ where __PUNCT__ forti year ago __PUNCT__ martin luther king gave a histor speech __PUNCT__
i talk about that speech then __PUNCT__ and i want to talk about it todai __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ king wa torment by the wai he had kept silent for two year about the vietnam war __PUNCT__
he wa told that if he spoke out he would hurt the civil right movement and all that he had work for __PUNCT__ but he could not take it ani more __PUNCT__ instead of decri the silenc of other __PUNCT__ he spoke the truth about himself __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ over the past two year __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ i have move to break the betray of my own silenc and speak from the burn of my own heart __PUNCT__
i am not holier than thou __PUNCT__
i am not perfect by ani mean __PUNCT__
but there ar event in life that you learn from __PUNCT__ and which remind you what thi is realli all about __PUNCT__
mayb i have been freed from the system and the fear that hold back politician becaus i have learn there ar much more import thing in life than win elect at the cost of sell your soul __PUNCT__
especi right now __PUNCT__ when our countri requir so much more of us __PUNCT__ and need to hear the truth from it leader __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ although i have spent my entir life take on the big power interest and win __PUNCT__ which is why i have never taken a dime from washington lobbyist or polit action committe __PUNCT__ i too have been guilti of my own silenc __PUNCT__ but no more __PUNCT__
it time to tell the truth __PUNCT__
and the truth is the system in washington is corrupt __PUNCT__
it is rig by the power special interest to benefit thei veri few at the expens of the mani __PUNCT__
and as a result __PUNCT__ the american peopl have lost faith in our broken system in washington __PUNCT__ and believ it no longer work for ordinari american __PUNCT__
thei right __PUNCT__
as i look across the polit landscap of both parti todai __PUNCT__ what i see ar politician too afraid to tell the truth __PUNCT__ good peopl caught in a bad system that overwhelm their good intent and requir them to chase million of dollar in campaign contribut in order to perpetu their career and continu their climb to higher offic __PUNCT__
thi presidenti campaign is a perfect exampl of how our polit is awash with monei __PUNCT__
i have rais more monei up to thi point than ani democrat candid rais last time in the presidenti campaign __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ i did it without take a dime from ani washington lobbyist or ani special interest pac __PUNCT__
i saw the chase for campaign monei at ani cost by the frontrunn in thi race __PUNCT__ and i did not join it __PUNCT__ becaus the cost to our nation and our children is not worth the hollow victori of ani candid __PUNCT__
be call presid while power interest realli run thing is not the same as be free to lead thi nation as presid of a govern of the peopl __PUNCT__ by the peopl __PUNCT__ and for the peopl __PUNCT__
if protect the current establish structur in washington is in your interest __PUNCT__ then i am not your candid __PUNCT__
i ran for presid four year ago __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ in part out of person ambit __PUNCT__ but also with a deep desir to stand for work peopl like my father and mother __PUNCT__ who no matter how hard thing were for our famili __PUNCT__ alwai work even harder to make thing better for us __PUNCT__
but the more elizabeth and i campaign thi year __PUNCT__ the more we talk to the american peopl __PUNCT__ the more we met peopl just like my father __PUNCT__ and hard work peopl like jame low __PUNCT__
jame is a decent and honest man who had to live for __NUM__ year with no voic in the richest countri in the world becaus he didn't have health care __PUNCT__
the more peopl like him that i met __PUNCT__ the more i realiz someth much bigger wa stir in the american peopl __PUNCT__
and it ha stir in each of us for far too long __PUNCT__
last month ken burn __PUNCT__ who made the great civil war documentari __PUNCT__ launch hi newest epic on world war ii on pb __PUNCT__ and what a stori it tell __PUNCT__
at the cost of great suffer __PUNCT__ blood and enorm sacrific __PUNCT__ within four year after pearl harbor it is incred what thi nation achiev __PUNCT__
america built the arsen of democraci worthi of our great histori __PUNCT__
we launch the greatest invas armada in the histori of warfar against hitler fortress europ __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ with our alli __PUNCT__ we freed a contin of suffer human __PUNCT__
at the same time on the other side of the globe we cross __NUM__ mile of ocean and liber anoth hemispher of human __PUNCT__ island and nation freed from the grip of japanes militarist __PUNCT__
while at the same time succeed in the greatest scientif endeavor ever undertaken __PUNCT__ the manhattan project __PUNCT__ and top it off with build the pentagon __PUNCT__ on of the largest build in the world in a littl over a year __PUNCT__
it is incred what america ha accomplish __PUNCT__
becaus no matter what extraordinari challeng we have been face with __PUNCT__ we did exactli what america ha alwai done in our histori __PUNCT__ we rose to the challeng __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ as i travel across america and listen to peopl __PUNCT__ i hear real concern about what go on __PUNCT__
for the first time in our nation histori __PUNCT__ peopl ar worri that we go to be the first gener of american not to pass on a better life to our children __PUNCT__
and it not the fault of the american peopl __PUNCT__
the american peopl have not chang __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar still the strong __PUNCT__ courag peopl thei have alwai been __PUNCT__
the problem is what our govern ha becom __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ it is up to us to do someth about it __PUNCT__
becaus washington mai not see it __PUNCT__ but we ar face a moral crisi as great as ani that ha ever challeng us __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ it is thi test __PUNCT__ thi moral test __PUNCT__ that i have come to understand is at the heart of thi campaign __PUNCT__
just look at what ha happen in iraq __PUNCT__
what wa the respons of the american peopl to the challeng at hand __PUNCT__ our men and women in uniform have been hero __PUNCT__
thei done everyth that been ask of them and more __PUNCT__
but what about our govern __PUNCT__ four year after invad iraq __PUNCT__ we cannot even keep the light on in baghdad __PUNCT__
when hurrican katrina hit new orlean __PUNCT__ the american peopl were at their best __PUNCT__
thei donat their time and their monei in record number __PUNCT__
there wa an outpour of support __PUNCT__
i took __NUM__ colleg kid down to help __PUNCT__ young peopl who gave up their spring break __PUNCT__
but what about our govern __PUNCT__ three year after hurrican katrina thousand of our fellow american __PUNCT__ our brother and sister __PUNCT__ ar still hous in trailer wait to go home __PUNCT__
there no better exampl of the braveri and good of the american peopl than the respons to the attack of 9/11 __PUNCT__ firefight and first respond risk and too often give their live to save other __PUNCT__ charg up the stair while everyon els wa come down __PUNCT__ record bloodbank donat __PUNCT__ and the list goe on __PUNCT__
but what about our govern __PUNCT__ six year after 9/11 __PUNCT__ at ground zero there sit onli a black hole that tortur our conscienc and scar our heart __PUNCT__
in everi instanc we see an american peopl who ar good __PUNCT__ decent __PUNCT__ compassion and undet __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ american peopl who ar better than the govern that is suppos to serv and repres them __PUNCT__
and what ha happen to the american __PUNCT__ can do __PUNCT__ spirit __PUNCT__ i will tell you what ha happen __PUNCT__ all of thi is the result of the bitter poison fruit of corrupt and the bankruptci of our polit leadership __PUNCT__
it is not an accid that the govern of the unit state cannot function on behalf of it peopl __PUNCT__ becaus it is no longer our peopl govern __PUNCT__ and we the peopl know it __PUNCT__
thi corrupt did not begin yesterdai __PUNCT__ and it did not even begin with georg bush __PUNCT__ it ha been build for decad __PUNCT__ until it now threaten liter the life of our democraci __PUNCT__
while the american peopl person rose to the occas with an enorm outpour of support and donat to both the victim of katrina and 9/11 __PUNCT__ we all saw our govern neglect __PUNCT__
and we saw greed and incompet at work __PUNCT__
out of more than __NUM__ contract valu at __MONEY__ or greater __PUNCT__ at least half were given without full competit or __PUNCT__ accord to new sourc __PUNCT__ with vagu or open end term __PUNCT__ and mani of these contract went to compani with deep polit connect such as a subsidiari of haliburton __PUNCT__ bechtel corp __PUNCT__ and ashbritt inc __PUNCT__
and in iraq __PUNCT__ while our nation brave son and daughter put their live on the line for our countri __PUNCT__ we now have mercenari under their own law while their boss sit at home rake in million __PUNCT__
we have squander million on build olymp size swim pool and build that have never been us __PUNCT__
we have weapon and ammunit unaccount for that mai now be be us against our own soldier __PUNCT__
we liter have billion wast or misspent __PUNCT__ while our troop and their famili continu to sacrific __PUNCT__
and the polit connect lobbi for more __PUNCT__
what their great sacrific __PUNCT__ higher profit __PUNCT__
it goe on everi minut of everi dai __PUNCT__
corpor execut at unit airlin and us airwai receiv million in compens for take their compani into bankruptci __PUNCT__ while their employe ar forc to take cut in pai __PUNCT__
compani like wal __PUNCT__ mart lobbi against inspect contain enter our nation port __PUNCT__ even though expert after expert agre that the likeliest wai for a dirti bomb to enter the unit state is through a contain __PUNCT__ becaus thei believ their profit ar more import than our safeti __PUNCT__
what ha becom of america when america largest compani lobbi against protect america __PUNCT__ trade deal cost of million of job __PUNCT__
what do we get in return __PUNCT__ million of danger chines toi in our children crib laden with lead __PUNCT__
thi is the price we ar made to pai when trade agreement ar decid base on how much thei pad the profit for multin corpor instead of what is best for america worker or the safeti of america consum __PUNCT__
we have even gotten to the point where our children safeti is potenti at risk becaus nearli half of the appl juic consum by our children come from appl grown in china __PUNCT__
and american ar kept in the dark becaus the corpor lobbyist have push back countri of origin label law again and again __PUNCT__
thi is not the america i believ in __PUNCT__
the hubri of greed know no bound __PUNCT__
dai after the homeland secur bill pass __PUNCT__ staffer from the homeland secur depart resign and becam homeland secur consult try to cash in __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ where wa the outrag __PUNCT__ there wa none __PUNCT__ becaus that how it work in washington now __PUNCT__
it is not a republican revolv door or a democrat revolv door __PUNCT__ it is just the wai it done __PUNCT__
someon call it a govern reconnaiss mission to figur out how to get rich when you leav the govern __PUNCT__
recent __PUNCT__ i wa dismai to see headlin in the wall street journal state that senat democrat were back down to lobbyist for hedg fund who have oppos effort to make millionair and billionair hedg fund manag pai the same tax rate as everi hard __PUNCT__ work american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ tax loophol the wealthi hedg fund manag do not need or deserv ar not go to be close __PUNCT__ all becaus democrat __PUNCT__ our parti __PUNCT__ want their campaign monei __PUNCT__
and a few week ago __PUNCT__ around the sixth anniversari of 9/11 __PUNCT__ a lead presidenti candid held a fundrais that wa bill as a homeland secur theme event in washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ target to homeland secur lobbyist and contractor for __MONEY__ a plate __PUNCT__
these lobbyist __PUNCT__ for the price of a ticket __PUNCT__ would get a special __PUNCT__ treat __PUNCT__ the opportun to particip in small __PUNCT__ hour long breakout session with kei democrat lawmak __PUNCT__ mani of whom chair import sub committe of the homeland secur committe __PUNCT__
that presidenti candid wa senat clinton __PUNCT__
senat clinton road to the middl class take a major detour right through the deep canyon of corpor lobbyist and the hidden bid of k street in washington __PUNCT__ and histori tell us that when that bu stop there it is the middl class that lose __PUNCT__
when i ask hillari clinton to join me in not take monei from washington lobbyist __PUNCT__ she refus __PUNCT__
not onli did she sai that she would continu to take their monei __PUNCT__ she defend them __PUNCT__
todai hillari clinton ha taken more monei from washington lobbyist than ani candid from either parti __PUNCT__ more monei than ani republican candid __PUNCT__
she ha taken more monei from the defens industri than ani other candid from either parti as well __PUNCT__
she took more monei from wall street last quarter than rudi giuliani __PUNCT__ mitt romnei __PUNCT__ and barack obama combin __PUNCT__
the long slow slide of our democraci into the corpor abyss continu unab regardless of parti __PUNCT__ regardless of the best interest of america __PUNCT__
we have a duti __PUNCT__ a duti to end thi __PUNCT__
i believ you cannot be for chang and take monei from the lobbyist who prevent chang __PUNCT__
you cannot take on the entrench interest in washington if you choos to defend the broken system __PUNCT__
it will not work __PUNCT__
and i believ that __PUNCT__ if american have a choic __PUNCT__ and candid who take their monei __PUNCT__ democrat or republican __PUNCT__ will lose thi elect __PUNCT__
for us to continu down thi path all we have to do is suspend all that we believ in __PUNCT__
as democrat __PUNCT__ we continu down thi path onli if we believ the parti of the peopl is no more __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we continu down thi path onli if we fail to heed lincoln warn to us all __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ at what point then is the approach of danger to be expect __PUNCT__ he ask __PUNCT__ if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us __PUNCT__
it can not come from abroad __PUNCT__
if destruct be our lot __PUNCT__ we must ourselv be it author and finish __PUNCT__
as a nation of free men we must live through all time or die by suicid __PUNCT__
america live becaus __NUM__ gener have honor the on moral command that make us american __PUNCT__
to give our children a better futur than we receiv __PUNCT__
i stand here todai the son of wallac and bobbi edward __PUNCT__
the father of wade __PUNCT__ cate __PUNCT__ emma clair and jack __PUNCT__ and i know __PUNCT__ as well as you __PUNCT__ that we must not be the first gener that fail to live up to our moral challeng and keep the promis of america __PUNCT__
that would be an abomin __PUNCT__
there is a dream that is america __PUNCT__
it is what make us american __PUNCT__
and i will not stand by while that dream is at risk __PUNCT__
i am not perfect __PUNCT__ far from it __PUNCT__ but i do understand that thi is not a polit issu __PUNCT__ it is the moral test of our gener __PUNCT__
our nation founder knew that thi moment would come __PUNCT__ that at some point the power of greed and it influenc over offici in our govern might strain and threaten the veri america thei hope would last as an ideal in the mind of all peopl __PUNCT__ and as a beacon of hope for all time __PUNCT__
that is why thei made the peopl sovereign __PUNCT__
and thi is why it is your respons to redeem the promis of america for our children and their futur __PUNCT__
it will not be easi __PUNCT__ sacrific will be requir of us __PUNCT__ but it wa never easi for our ancestor __PUNCT__ and their sacrific were far greater than ani that will fall on our shoulder __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ the respons is our __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ you and i __PUNCT__ ar the guardian of what america is and what it will be __PUNCT__
the choic is our __PUNCT__
down on path __PUNCT__ we trade corpor democrat for corpor republican __PUNCT__ our croni for their croni __PUNCT__ on polit dynasti for anoth dynasti __PUNCT__ and all we ar left with is a democrat version of the republican corrupt machin __PUNCT__
it is the easier path __PUNCT__
it is the path of the statu quo __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ it is a path that perpetu a corrupt system that ha not onli fail to deliv the chang the american peopl demand __PUNCT__ but ha divid america into two __PUNCT__ on america for the veri greedi __PUNCT__ and on america for everybodi els __PUNCT__
and it is that divid america __PUNCT__ the direct result of thi corrupt system __PUNCT__ which mai veri well lead to the suicid lincoln warn us of __PUNCT__ the poison that continu to seep into our system while none notic __PUNCT__
or we can choos a differ path __PUNCT__
