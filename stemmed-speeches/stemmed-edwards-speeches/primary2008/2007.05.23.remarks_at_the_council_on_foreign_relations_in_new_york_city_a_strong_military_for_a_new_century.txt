it is wonder to be back here at the council __PUNCT__
thank you for have me __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ i had the great pleasur of co __PUNCT__ chair a council task forc with jack kemp on the futur of the u.s. __PUNCT__ russia relationship __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ that experi serv as a power remind of what can be achiev when peopl of diverg view __PUNCT__ bound by a common belief in america respons as a global leader __PUNCT__ can come togeth to grappl with difficult nation secur challeng __PUNCT__
our main conclus ar just as relev todai __PUNCT__ that russia direct is critic import to america nation secur __PUNCT__ from non __PUNCT__ prolifer and energi secur to the spread of hiv/aid __PUNCT__
and as our report titl made clear __PUNCT__ russia ha been head in the wrong direct __PUNCT__ whether in it de __PUNCT__ democrat or by bulli it neighbor __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we have not been abl to concentr suffici energi on critic issu like get our relationship with russia right __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we been distract by larger problem creat by thi presid militari and nation secur polici __PUNCT__
the core of thi presid ha been a polit doctrin that georg bush call the __PUNCT__ global war on terror __PUNCT__
he ha us thi doctrin like a sledgehamm to justifi the worst abus and biggest mistak of hi administr __PUNCT__ from guantanamo and abu ghraib __PUNCT__ to the war in iraq __PUNCT__
the worst thing about the global war on terror approach is that it ha backfir __PUNCT__ our militari ha been strain to the break point and the threat from terror ha grown __PUNCT__
we need a post __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ 9/11 __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ iraq american militari that is mission __PUNCT__ focus on protect american from __NUM__ centuri threat __PUNCT__ not misus for discredit ideolog pursuit __PUNCT__
we need to recogn that we have far more power weapon avail to us than just bomb __PUNCT__ and we need to bring them to bear __PUNCT__
we need to reengag the world with the full weight of our moral leadership __PUNCT__
what we need is not more slogan but a comprehens strategi to deal with the complex challeng of both deliv justic and be just __PUNCT__
not hard power __PUNCT__
not soft power __PUNCT__
smart power __PUNCT__
nowher ar the problem of thi administr polici more tragic evid than in iraq __PUNCT__
iraq problem ar deep and danger __PUNCT__ but thei cannot be solv by the u. __PUNCT__ militari alon __PUNCT__
my plan call on congress to us it fund power to stop the surg and forc an immedi withdraw of __NUM__ to __NUM__ combat troop from iraq __PUNCT__ follow by an orderli and complet withdraw of all combat troop in about a year __PUNCT__
the presid ha plai polit brinksmanship over the war in iraq time and time again __PUNCT__
he refus to acknowledg the futil of hi approach __PUNCT__ disregard the clear messag sent by the american peopl last fall __PUNCT__ and fals claim that the onli wai for congress to support the troop is to prolong the war __PUNCT__
that just not true __PUNCT__
congress can support the troop and end the war __PUNCT__ which is exactli what the bill thei sent the presid last month would have done __PUNCT__
when the presid veto that bill __PUNCT__ it wa the presid alon who wa block support for the troop __PUNCT__
nobodi els __PUNCT__
ani compromis that fund the war through the end of the fiscal year isn't a compromis at all __PUNCT__ it a capitul __PUNCT__
as i have said repeatedli __PUNCT__ congress should send the presid the same bill he veto again and again until he realiz he ha no choic but to start bring our troop home __PUNCT__
we need to get out of iraq on our own timet __PUNCT__ not when we ar forc to do so by event __PUNCT__
as a recent council report put it __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ ha alreadi achiev all that it is like to achiev in iraq __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ stai in iraq can onli drive up the price of these gain in blood __PUNCT__ treasur __PUNCT__ and strateg posit __PUNCT__
iraq ha done tremend damag to the u. __PUNCT__ interest in the middl east __PUNCT__ our militari __PUNCT__ and to our moral author to lead __PUNCT__
it ha also complet consum our countri foreign polici debat __PUNCT__
in congress and the white hous __PUNCT__ the focu ha been on when to get out __PUNCT__ how to get out __PUNCT__ and how quickli __PUNCT__
too littl consider ha been given to what happen after we get out __PUNCT__ and that is the veri least we ow to the men and women of the u. __PUNCT__ arm forc and their famili __PUNCT__ who have sacrif so much __PUNCT__
i believ that onc we ar out of iraq __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ must retain suffici forc in the region to prevent a genocid __PUNCT__ deter a region spillov of the civil war __PUNCT__ and prevent an al qaeda safe haven __PUNCT__
we will most like need to retain quick reaction forc in kuwait and in the persian gulf __PUNCT__
we will also need some presenc in baghdad __PUNCT__ insid the green zone __PUNCT__ to protect the american embassi and other personnel __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we will need a diplomat offens to engag the rest of the world in iraq futur __PUNCT__ includ middl eastern nation and our alli in europ __PUNCT__
as everyon in thi room know __PUNCT__ the iraq war ha made it far more difficult to deal with other global challeng __PUNCT__ whether it the worsen situat in afghanistan __PUNCT__ where the taliban is resurg __PUNCT__
the nuclear ambit of state like north korea and iran __PUNCT__ the crise in darfur and northern uganda __PUNCT__
the effort to help bring peac between israel and it neighbor __PUNCT__
the grow econom and secur threat from global warm __PUNCT__
the plight of the over a billion peopl who live on less than a dollar a dai __PUNCT__ or the vast implic of the polit and econom rise of state like india and china and the neg trend in russia __PUNCT__
throughout thi campaign __PUNCT__ i have spoken about what we need to do to deal with these huge challeng __PUNCT__
in the futur __PUNCT__ i will continu to chart a cours for america to regain the global statur and legitimaci that we need to lead and shape the world our children and grandchildren will inherit __PUNCT__
but that cours begin with an understand of power and it purpos in all it form __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ moral and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ militari power __PUNCT__
the great dean acheson onc said that __PUNCT__ prestig is the shadow cast by power __PUNCT__
if that is so __PUNCT__ we risk squander our prestig __PUNCT__ as the current administr ha done __PUNCT__ if we misus and misdirect our tremend power __PUNCT__
i will also talk more specif about what i intend to do __PUNCT__ as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ to lead our great militari and restor the contract we have with those who proudli wear the uniform to defend our countri and make the world a safe and better place __PUNCT__
lead the militari out of the wreckag left by the poor civilian leadership of thi administr will be the singl most import duti of the next command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__
the next command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief face sever import question for the futur __PUNCT__ how will we rebuild our militari forc __PUNCT__ which most everyon agre ha been sever stress __PUNCT__ if not broken __PUNCT__ by the debacl in iraq __PUNCT__ what lesson have we learn about how the militari should be us __PUNCT__ and what is the right role for our militari as we seek to restor our moral leadership in the world __PUNCT__ the answer to these question ar what i would like to talk about todai __PUNCT__
i can think of no better time to have thi discuss than in the dai lead up to memori dai __PUNCT__
thi is a dai far more meaning than ballgam and barbequ __PUNCT__
it is a time when we honor those who have sacrif to protect our freedom __PUNCT__
memori dai ha alwai had special mean for our famili __PUNCT__
my wife elizabeth grew up on militari base around the world __PUNCT__ as the daughter of a navi aviat __PUNCT__
from the u.s. __PUNCT__
quinci __PUNCT__ elizabeth father vincent took part in the first bomb run of japan dure world war ii __PUNCT__
later __PUNCT__ after the war __PUNCT__ elizabeth and her parent return to live in japan __PUNCT__ where her father wa station __PUNCT__
world war ii wa not simpli a moment of militari glori __PUNCT__ a moment of triumph for the citizen soldier __PUNCT__
it wa much more than that __PUNCT__
the gener that won world war ii is not call the greatest gener becaus of the victori thei earn on the battlefield __PUNCT__ but becaus of what thei did with that victori __PUNCT__ of what thei gave to us and the world __PUNCT__
militari power without purpos is ultim self __PUNCT__ defeat __PUNCT__
our activ engag in the world after world war ii is an exampl of why we need a strong militari __PUNCT__
it reveal the relationship between the strength of our militari and the power of american ideal __PUNCT__
think about the choic our wise leader made in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it would have been easi enough for america to glanc at the devast and just as quickli look the other wai __PUNCT__
we had save the world from nazism and fascism __PUNCT__
we were wealthi and we were safe __PUNCT__
mani thought it wa time we went home __PUNCT__
but american like presid harri truman and gener georg marshal saw the truth __PUNCT__ that it would requir not onli america militari might __PUNCT__ but our ingenu __PUNCT__ our alli __PUNCT__ and our generos to rebuild europ and keep it safe from tyrant who would prei on poverti and resent __PUNCT__
our leader resist the imperi temptat to forc our will by virtu of our unmatch strength __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ thei built bond of trust found on restraint __PUNCT__ the rule of law __PUNCT__ and good faith __PUNCT__
thei were magnanim out of strength __PUNCT__ not weak __PUNCT__
gener marshal __PUNCT__ on of thi countri greatest militari leader __PUNCT__ wa later award the nobel peac prize for hi leadership in rebuild europ and promot peac in the world __PUNCT__
in hi nobel accept speech __PUNCT__ gener marshal said that militari power wa __PUNCT__ too narrow a basi on which to build a depend __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ endur peac __PUNCT__
as the marshal plan demonstr __PUNCT__ the militari is onli a mean to an end __PUNCT__ it is onli on instrument of our power __PUNCT__
it must work alongsid __PUNCT__ and reinforc __PUNCT__ america moral leadership __PUNCT__
we saw the power of thi relationship dure the cold war __PUNCT__ when america deter the soviet union from it quest for world domin __PUNCT__
we saw it when we establish the unit nation and nato __PUNCT__ which have done so much for peac and human right __PUNCT__
after the cold war __PUNCT__ we saw it in bosnia __PUNCT__ where we help broker a last peac __PUNCT__
and we saw it again in kosovo __PUNCT__ where we join our nato alli to stop a brutal war crimin from perpetr anoth campaign of ethnic cleans __PUNCT__
thi is the america where i grew up as a young boi __PUNCT__ a strong nation whose moral promis seem to fill the heart of almost everyon i knew __PUNCT__
we believ that america __PUNCT__ like a beacon __PUNCT__ could light up even the darkest corner of the world __PUNCT__
as we all saw six year ago __PUNCT__ on __DATE__ america great alon doe not protect us from veri real threat __PUNCT__
at that moment __PUNCT__ the presid could have sent a messag of swift justic but also moral leadership __PUNCT__
he could have told us where destroi al qaeda fit into the broader challeng america face in the new centuri __PUNCT__
he could have ask all american to sacrific in thi new struggl __PUNCT__ invit a hope new era of citizenship as the ultim answer to the terrorist __PUNCT__ cynic __PUNCT__ evil attack __PUNCT__
but he didn't __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he adopt the most short __PUNCT__ sight __PUNCT__ ideolog polici avail __PUNCT__
hi strategi ha put sever strain on our militari __PUNCT__
tarnish our moral stand in the ey of the world __PUNCT__ and embolden our enemi __PUNCT__
it is now clear that georg bush misnam __PUNCT__ war on terror __PUNCT__ ha backfir __PUNCT__ and is now part of the problem __PUNCT__
the war on terror is a slogan design onli for polit __PUNCT__ not a strategi to make america safe __PUNCT__
it a bumper sticker __PUNCT__ not a plan __PUNCT__
it ha damag our allianc and weaken our stand in the world __PUNCT__
as a polit __PUNCT__ frame __PUNCT__ it been us to justifi everyth from the iraq war to guantanamo to illeg spy on the american peopl __PUNCT__
it even been us by thi white hous as a partisan weapon to bludgeon their polit oppon __PUNCT__
whether by manipul threat level lead up to elect __PUNCT__ or by deem oppon __PUNCT__ weak on terror __PUNCT__ thei have shown no hesit whatsoev about us fear to divid __PUNCT__
but the worst thing about thi slogan is that it hasn't work __PUNCT__
the so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ ha creat even more terror __PUNCT__ as we have seen so tragic in iraq __PUNCT__
the state depart itself recent releas a studi show that worldwid terror ha increas __NUM__ __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ includ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ surg in civilian fatal __PUNCT__
by frame thi as a __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ we have walk right into the trap that terrorist have set __PUNCT__ that we ar engag in some kind of clash of civil and a war against islam __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ metaphor ha also fail becaus it exagger the role of onli on instrument of american power __PUNCT__ the militari __PUNCT__
thi ha occur in part becaus the militari is so effect at what it doe __PUNCT__
yet if you think all you have is a hammer __PUNCT__ then everi problem look like a nail __PUNCT__
there an emerg consensu insid the arm forc that we must move beyond the idea of a war on terror __PUNCT__
the command of the u. __PUNCT__ militari central command recent state that he would no longer us the __PUNCT__ long war __PUNCT__ framework __PUNCT__
top militari leader like retir gener anthoni zinni have reject the term __PUNCT__
these leader know we need substanc __PUNCT__ not slogan __PUNCT__ leadership __PUNCT__ not label __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ what should replac the war on terror __PUNCT__ sinc the end of the cold war __PUNCT__ folk here at cfr and elsewher have been engag in an effort to be the next georg kennan and defin the era __PUNCT__
as all of you know __PUNCT__ we need a new strategi for rebuild a strong militari for a new centuri __PUNCT__
ani new strategi must includ new prevent measur to win the long __PUNCT__ term struggl and fuel hope and opportun __PUNCT__
thi includ strong and creativ diplomaci __PUNCT__ and also new effort to lead the fight against global poverti __PUNCT__
i propos a plan to lead an intern effort to educ everi child in the world __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i would increas foreign assist by __MONEY__ billion a year to make million of peopl safer __PUNCT__ healthier __PUNCT__ and more democrat __PUNCT__ and by creat a cabinet __PUNCT__ level post to lead thi effort __PUNCT__
ani new strategi must improv how we gather intellig __PUNCT__
from my year on the senat intellig committe __PUNCT__ i know how difficult thi can be __PUNCT__
we must alwai seek to protect our nation secur by aggress gather intellig in accord with proven method __PUNCT__
yet we cannot do so by abandon human right and the rule of law __PUNCT__
as two former gener recent wrote in the washington post __PUNCT__ if we forfeit our valu by signal that thei ar negoti __PUNCT__
we drive __PUNCT__ undecid into the arm of the enemi __PUNCT__
and we must avoid action that will give terrorist or even other nation an excus to abandon intern law __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will close guantanamo bai __PUNCT__ restor habea corpu __PUNCT__ and ban tortur __PUNCT__
measur like these will help america onc again achiev it histor moral statur __PUNCT__ and lead the world toward democraci and peac __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ a new strategi must have a clear idea of how to rebuild the u. __PUNCT__ militari __PUNCT__
for the last four year __PUNCT__ the administr ha not onli mismanag the war in iraq __PUNCT__
it ha mismanag the militari itself __PUNCT__
we all know the histor ironi here __PUNCT__
the presid and hi team held themselv out as steward of the militari __PUNCT__
dure hi campaign in __NUM__ then __PUNCT__ governor bush went to the citadel in south carolina and said our militari power should be us __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ wise __PUNCT__ rememb the cost of war __PUNCT__
hi team came into offic with decad of experi __PUNCT__
thei promis that __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ help wa on the wai __PUNCT__
thei made bold pronounc about new militari doctrin like __PUNCT__ transform __PUNCT__ and an __PUNCT__ end to nation __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__
thei held themselv out as savior __PUNCT__ call themselv vulcan __PUNCT__ and cast their oppon as amateur who should bow down befor their slogan and gestur __PUNCT__
thei even disregard the advic of highli __PUNCT__ decor militari offic themselv __PUNCT__
the result have been a disast __PUNCT__
thi administr polici have been particularli hard on our militari men and women and their famili __PUNCT__
presid bush could have call on all american to sacrific __PUNCT__
but the onli on who have been at war __PUNCT__ the onli on ask to sacrific __PUNCT__ have been our soldier __PUNCT__ sailor __PUNCT__ airmen __PUNCT__ marin __PUNCT__ and their famili __PUNCT__
and that wrong __PUNCT__
i am here todai to announc a new pledg to america servicemen and women __PUNCT__ their famili __PUNCT__ and our veteran __PUNCT__
we will stand by you just as you have stood by us __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will implement a defens polici base on five major principl __PUNCT__ ensur that our militari polici is plan and execut to fulfil essenti nation secur mission __PUNCT__ not some ideolog fanci __PUNCT__ repair the tremend damag done to civil __PUNCT__ militari relat __PUNCT__ root out cronyism and wast and increas effici in the pentagon __PUNCT__ rebalanc our forc structur for the challeng of the new centuri __PUNCT__ includ improv our capabl to help weak or fail state __PUNCT__ and take a broader view of secur throughout our govern __PUNCT__
with these step __PUNCT__ we can begin to rebuild an american militari for a new centuri __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we must clarifi the mission of a post __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ 9/11 __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ iraq american militari for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
we must be clear about when it is appropri for a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief to us forc __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will onli us offens forc after all other option includ diplomaci have been exhaust __PUNCT__ and after we have made effort to bring as mani countri as possibl to our side __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ there ar time when forc is justifi __PUNCT__ to protect our vital nation interest __PUNCT__ to respond to act of aggress by other nation and non __PUNCT__ state actor __PUNCT__ to protect treati alli and allianc commit __PUNCT__ to prevent terrorist from acquir nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and to prevent or stop genocid __PUNCT__
yet we must rememb the complementari relationship between militari forc and diplomaci __PUNCT__
too often dure the past six year __PUNCT__ thi administr diplomat effort have left the u. __PUNCT__ with two unaccept option __PUNCT__ do noth or us forc __PUNCT__
we must do better than that __PUNCT__
we should alwai seek to solv problem peacefulli __PUNCT__ prefer work with other __PUNCT__
yet on of the oldest rule of statecraft is that diplomaci is most effect when back by a strong militari __PUNCT__
that doe not mean __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ that everi problem need a militari answer __PUNCT__ far from it __PUNCT__
our militari ha three import mission __PUNCT__ deter and respond to aggressor __PUNCT__ make sure that weak and fail state do not threaten our interest __PUNCT__ and maintain our strateg advantag against major competitor __PUNCT__
the first mission is deter or respond to those who wish to do us harm __PUNCT__
i want to make on thing absolut clear __PUNCT__ ani american presid must be abl to act with swift and strength against anyon who will do us harm __PUNCT__
but by elev thi right to a doctrin of __PUNCT__ prevent war __PUNCT__ thi administr ha onli isol us further __PUNCT__
our goal must be to defeat islam extremist and limit their reach __PUNCT__ not help them recruit and becom stronger __PUNCT__
a second mission is to ensur that the problem of weak and fail state do not creat danger for the unit state __PUNCT__
we face substanti secur threat from state that fall apart __PUNCT__
these situat ar not onli danger for these countri __PUNCT__ civilian popul __PUNCT__ thei creat region instabl and can strengthen terrorist group that __PUNCT__ in turn __PUNCT__ directli threaten the unit state __PUNCT__
a third mission is maintain our strateg advantag against major competitor state that could do us harm and otherwis threaten our interest __PUNCT__
in all of these mission __PUNCT__ we must continu to strengthen our great partnership __PUNCT__ whether bilater relationship with friend from great britain to israel to japan __PUNCT__ or through institut like nato __PUNCT__ which have done so much good for america and the world __PUNCT__
while the u. __PUNCT__ doe not need permiss to protect it interest __PUNCT__ we must realiz that our strength li in stand togeth with the world __PUNCT__ not apart __PUNCT__
next __PUNCT__ we must also re __PUNCT__ establish a strong connect with militari leadership __PUNCT__
the past few year have brought the biggest crisi in civil __PUNCT__ militari relat in a gener __PUNCT__
the mismanag of the pentagon ha been so sever that mani of our most decor retir offic ar speak out __PUNCT__
our constitut design is clear __PUNCT__ and our militari leadership clearli must follow a civilian command __PUNCT__
but thi doe not mean that civilian should be abl to ram through their pet militari project __PUNCT__
georg bush civilian leadership at the pentagon repeatedli ignor the counsel of their more experienc militari colleagu __PUNCT__
thei disregard wise gener like ric shinseki __PUNCT__ who advis that hundr of thousand of troop would be need to secur the peac in iraq __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will repair thi breach __PUNCT__
i will institut regular __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ on meet with my top militari leadership __PUNCT__ so their analysi and advic will not be filter __PUNCT__ and so i will have the best inform about what best for our troop on the ground __PUNCT__
i will also reinstat a basic doctrin that ha been demolish by the bush administr __PUNCT__
under my administr __PUNCT__ militari profession will have primari respons in matter of tactic and oper __PUNCT__ while civilian leadership will have author in all matter of broad strategi and polit decis __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will exercis command __PUNCT__ and i will deleg the decis to us forc to no on __PUNCT__
but i will also remov ani civilian or militari offic who stifl debat or simpli tell me what i want to hear __PUNCT__
the administr mismanag of the militari ha not onli breach the faith at the highest level __PUNCT__ it ha led to a veri danger situat for our troop __PUNCT__ their famili __PUNCT__ and our nation __PUNCT__
the militari that is fight in iraq and afghanistan is veri differ from ani that gone to battl befor __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ activ __PUNCT__ duti servicemen and women ar __PUNCT__ on averag __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
guard and reserv member ar __PUNCT__ on averag __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ of those deploi have left famili at home __PUNCT__ and about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of those kill in action have left a spous or child behind __PUNCT__
alarmingli high rate of post __PUNCT__ traumat stress disord ar be report __PUNCT__
these troop ar exhaust and overwork __PUNCT__ and we have been forc to dig deeper and deeper to find ground forc for iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
thi leav us ill __PUNCT__ prepar for the futur __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ everi avail combat activ __PUNCT__ duti armi combat brigad ha been to iraq or afghanistan for at least on __NUM__ __PUNCT__ month tour __PUNCT__
we ar send some troop back to iraq with less than a year rest __PUNCT__
to make matter wors __PUNCT__ the secretari of defens just extend tour from __NUM__ to __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ which is unconscion __PUNCT__
and recruit ha suffer __PUNCT__
the armi ha been meet it recruit target __PUNCT__ but onli by lower it standard __PUNCT__
recruit from the least __PUNCT__ skill categori have increas __NUM__ __PUNCT__ over the past two year __PUNCT__
and the armi grant nearli twice as mani waiver for feloni and other shortcom in __NUM__ as in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ it is clear that guard and reserv member will alwai plai an activ and valuabl role in the total forc of the unit state __PUNCT__
yet thei have been subject to repeat and lengthi deploy that do not fit their job descript __PUNCT__
thei also need to be avail to respond to disast domest __PUNCT__
and as the disgrac condit at walter reed demonstr __PUNCT__ thi administr ha fail our servicemen and women not onli in iraq __PUNCT__ but here at home __PUNCT__
i will never allow our wound to be hous in dilapid __PUNCT__ rodent __PUNCT__ infest facil __PUNCT__
on the contrari __PUNCT__ as i will be announc in remark later thi week __PUNCT__ i will make a new pledg to our veteran __PUNCT__ our servicemen and women __PUNCT__ and our militari famili __PUNCT__ that our benefit __PUNCT__ support servic __PUNCT__ and readjust program properli meet their need __PUNCT__
we ow them no less __PUNCT__
the problem of our forc structur is not best dealt with by a number game __PUNCT__
it is tempt for politician to try and __PUNCT__ out __PUNCT__ bid __PUNCT__ each other on the number of troop thei would add __PUNCT__
some politician have fallen right in line behind presid bush recent propos to add __NUM__ troop between now and __NUM__ with littl rational given for exactli why we need thi mani troop __PUNCT__ particularli with a like withdraw from iraq __PUNCT__
the number game onli get us into the same problem as the presid approach __PUNCT__
we must be more thought about what the troop will actual be us for __PUNCT__
ani troop we add todai would take a number of year to recruit and train __PUNCT__ and so will not help us todai in iraq __PUNCT__
we might need a substanti increas of troop in the armi __PUNCT__ marin corp __PUNCT__ and special forc for four reason __PUNCT__ to rebuild from iraq __PUNCT__ to bolster deterr __PUNCT__ to decreas our heavi relianc on guard and reserv member in militari oper __PUNCT__ and to deploi in afghanistan and ani other troubl spot that could develop __PUNCT__
while such propos ar worth close examin __PUNCT__ thei do not take into account our withdraw from iraq __PUNCT__ which i believ must occur in about a year __PUNCT__
we need to avoid throw number around for polit benefit and instead take a broader view __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will carefulli assess the post __PUNCT__ iraq threat environ and consult with militari command to determin the exact number of troop we need and where __PUNCT__
i will also doubl the budget for recruit __PUNCT__ and i will rais the standard for the recruit pool __PUNCT__ so we issu far fewer waiver than we do todai under the presid polici __PUNCT__
i will put substanti addit resourc into mainten of our equip and to reset the forc __PUNCT__
we must spend what it take to reset our forc after iraq __PUNCT__
we have seen a rapid deplet in our militari equip __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ vehicl __PUNCT__ includ tank and helicopt __PUNCT__ have been lost in iraq __PUNCT__ and our equip is be us at a rate of five to six time it peacetim us __PUNCT__
thi inadequaci is especi clear when we look at the demand that have been place on our guard and reserv member __PUNCT__
thei have been sent to battl without the best equip __PUNCT__
some unit slate to return to iraq recent report that thei still have outdat equip __PUNCT__
thi is unaccept __PUNCT__
the militari budget itself also need substanti reform __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ dozen of agenc perform overlap task __PUNCT__ and there is no central __PUNCT__ overal account of all secur activ perform by all relev agenc __PUNCT__
i will creat a nation secur budget that will includ all secur activ by the pentagon and the depart of energi __PUNCT__ and our homeland secur __PUNCT__ intellig __PUNCT__ and foreign affair agenc __PUNCT__
thi would allow more oversight and would also allow us to more carefulli tailor our expenditur to our mission __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ liter dozen of agenc have overlap respons __PUNCT__ mission __PUNCT__ task and program __PUNCT__
we don't link these effort togeth nearli enough __PUNCT__
we have nuclear prolifer program in the defens __PUNCT__ state __PUNCT__ and the energi depart __PUNCT__
we also have more than fifteen differ secur assist program __PUNCT__ run out of both the state depart and the defens depart __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will send to congress a nation secur budget that will grow out of a review of our militari __PUNCT__ our diplomaci __PUNCT__ our foreign assist program __PUNCT__ our intellig __PUNCT__ our global energi __PUNCT__ and our homeland secur activ __PUNCT__
thi budget will provid on govern __PUNCT__ wide strategi for counter nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ a unifi strategi for fight terrorist __PUNCT__ a unifi strategi for provid secur assist to our alli __PUNCT__ and clear guidanc for our agenc on how thei should set their budget prioriti to make these polici work __PUNCT__
the militari ha gone a long wai in make sure that it capabl and prepar to fight humanitarian crise __PUNCT__ as we saw when it provid aid to the victim of the pacif ocean tsunami __PUNCT__
but thi aid is often imbalanc __PUNCT__
we got on agenc on steroid __PUNCT__ the pentagon __PUNCT__ while the civilian agenc ar on life support __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will help rebal the deliveri of civilian servic throughout the feder govern __PUNCT__
