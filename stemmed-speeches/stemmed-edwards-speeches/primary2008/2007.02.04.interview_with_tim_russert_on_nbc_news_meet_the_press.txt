on top of that i __PUNCT__ beyond that __PUNCT__ i went back to former clinton administr offici who gave me sort of independ inform about what thei believ about what wa happen with saddam weapon __PUNCT__ weapon program __PUNCT__
thei were also wrong __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ base on that __PUNCT__ i made the wrong judgment __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i want to go anoth step __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ becaus i think thi is more than just weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ at the __PUNCT__ i rememb vividli what i wa think about at the time __PUNCT__
it wa __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ i wa convinc he had weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
that turn out to be complet wrong and fals __PUNCT__
i had intern conflict becaus i wa worri about what georg bush would do __PUNCT__
i didn't have __PUNCT__ i didn't have confid about him do the work that need to be done with the intern commun __PUNCT__ the lead __PUNCT__ up to a potenti invas in iraq __PUNCT__
i didn't know __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ that he would be as incompet as he been in the administr of the war __PUNCT__
but i had __PUNCT__ there were at least two thing go on __PUNCT__
it wasn't just the weapon of mass destruct i wa wrong about __PUNCT__
it becom absolut clear __PUNCT__ and i veri critic of myself for thi __PUNCT__ becom absolut clear __PUNCT__ look back __PUNCT__ that i should not have given thi presid thi author __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ at that time __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ senat kennedi sai __PUNCT__ thi is not an immin threat __PUNCT__
gener zinni __PUNCT__ who led the militari in that region __PUNCT__ said thi is the wrong war __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ gener scowcroft __PUNCT__ former presid bush nation secur advisor __PUNCT__
and the nation intellig estim that wa given to you and now made public had some real caveat __PUNCT__ and thi is on of them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the activ we have detect do not __PUNCT__ add up to a compel case that iraq is current pursu what inr __PUNCT__ the state depart bureau of intellig and research __PUNCT__ would consid to be an integr and comprehens approach to acquir nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
do you rememb see that __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__ i did see it __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i think it wa __PUNCT__ there were seriou question about whether __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ we look back __PUNCT__
now we know none of thi wa true __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ at the time __PUNCT__ there were seriou question about ani effort to obtain nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ which is what that statement just wa __PUNCT__
all of us believ there wa no question that he had chemic and biolog weapon __PUNCT__ and there wa at least some scatter evid that he wa make an effort to get nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but it seem as if __PUNCT__ as a member of the intellig committe __PUNCT__ you just got it dead wrong __PUNCT__ and that you even ignor some caveat and ignor peopl who were urg caution __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i would __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i don't want to defend thi __PUNCT__
let me be realli clear about thi __PUNCT__
i think anybodi who want to be presid of the unit state ha got to be honest and open __PUNCT__ be will to admit when thei done thing wrong __PUNCT__
on of the thing __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ that happen in iraq is we had a presid who wa complet unmov __PUNCT__ wouldn't chang cours __PUNCT__ wouldn't take ani respons or admit that he made ani mistak __PUNCT__
and i think america __PUNCT__ in fact the world ha paid a huge price for that __PUNCT__
so i accept my respons __PUNCT__
i not defend what i did __PUNCT__
becaus what happen wa the inform that we got on the intellig committe wa __PUNCT__ wa rel consist with what i wa get from former clinton administr offici __PUNCT__
i told you a few minut ago i wa concern about give thi presid the author __PUNCT__ and i turn out to be wrong about that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in that same speech i show earlier __PUNCT__ you seem to embrac __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ the bush vision of what could happen in iraq __PUNCT__
and let just watch that and come back and talk about it __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ democraci will not spring up by itself overnight in a multiethn __PUNCT__ complic societi that suffer under on repress regim after anoth for gener __PUNCT__
the iraqi peopl deserv and need our help to rebuild their live and to creat a prosper __PUNCT__ thrive __PUNCT__ open societi __PUNCT__
all iraqi __PUNCT__ includ sunni __PUNCT__ shia and kurd __PUNCT__ deserv to be repres __PUNCT__
thi is not just a moral imper __PUNCT__
it a secur imper __PUNCT__
it is in america nation interest to help build an iraq at peac with itself and it neighbor __PUNCT__ becaus a democrat __PUNCT__ toler and account iraq will be a peac region partner __PUNCT__ and such an iraq could serv as a model for the entir arab world __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ do you think that wa naiv __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i think that had __PUNCT__ had saddam __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ had the war in iraq been execut the wai that it should have been execut __PUNCT__ i think there would be a much greater likelihood of there be a democrat iraq __PUNCT__
i think we would still see at least some symptom of what we see rage on the ground in iraq right now __PUNCT__
but no __PUNCT__ i think there wa some potenti for a democraci in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ mani have suggest __PUNCT__ includ some of the candid fridai at the democrat nation committe __PUNCT__ that the reason so mani democrat vote for give the presid author in __DATE__ of __NUM__ wa a polit calcul __PUNCT__
thei were afraid of the midterm elect of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
do you think that fair __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ it a __PUNCT__ it a complet fair question __PUNCT__
if i __PUNCT__ if i were watch a __PUNCT__ a politician under those circumst __PUNCT__ i be veri cynic about what their motiv ar __PUNCT__ and why __PUNCT__ why thei did what thei did __PUNCT__
i can onli tell you __PUNCT__ in my case __PUNCT__ i came to the conclus __PUNCT__ turn out to be wrong __PUNCT__ that the presid should be given thi author __PUNCT__
i do think it import __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ not defens __PUNCT__ but import to point out that i didn't run the war and neither did the other peopl in congress who vote for the war __PUNCT__
the presid the on who made thi extraordinari mess __PUNCT__

i think saddam hussein wa a veri seriou threat __PUNCT__
i stand by that __PUNCT__ and that why we stand behind our vote on the resolut __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end of videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ that a year and a half into the war __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__

it wa pretti simpl __PUNCT__
and i got to the place i felt like i had to sai it and had to sai it publicli __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ what? __PUNCT__ a year __PUNCT__ a year or so ago i did that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but if you look back and peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the midterm elect of __NUM__ the democrat did not have the courag to stand up to presid bush and vote for the war __PUNCT__ week befor the mid __PUNCT__ the presidenti elect of __NUM__ you run for vice presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ a chanc to sai someth about the war __PUNCT__

russert __PUNCT__ last wednesdai you gave an interview to the politico __PUNCT__ and you said thi __PUNCT__ when we went to war __PUNCT__ senat clinton and i both vote for it __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i have sinc said i wa wrong __PUNCT__ and i take respons for that __PUNCT__
i have not heard senat clinton sai that __PUNCT__
should she sai she wa wrong __PUNCT__ edward wa __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that is a moral decis she ha to make __PUNCT__ edward said __PUNCT__
do you believ senat clinton is moral bound to admit the war wa wrong __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think she moral bound to follow her own conscienc __PUNCT__
if she __PUNCT__ if she believ __PUNCT__ and thi doesn't just appli to her __PUNCT__ it appli to anybodi in the congress __PUNCT__ if she believ that her vote wa wrong __PUNCT__ then ye __PUNCT__ she should sai so __PUNCT__
if she believ that her vote wa right __PUNCT__ then she should defend it __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ can you be the democrat candid for presid without sai the war wa wrong __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ of cours you can __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ if that what you truli believ __PUNCT__ and that what your heart and conscienc state __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you talk about silenc is betray __PUNCT__ and you urg your other candid to step forward and clearli enunci their view on the war in iraq __PUNCT__
the clinton campaign respond thi wai __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ john edward us to constantli brag about run a posit campaign __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ he ha unfortun chosen to open hi campaign with polit attack on democrat who ar fight the bush administr iraq polici __PUNCT__ said clinton advis howard wolfson __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ we ar at a critic time in american histori __PUNCT__
the last thing we should be worri about is how politician react and how their feel ar hurt __PUNCT__
what we ought to be focus on is what need to be done about thi moral issu about the war __PUNCT__
it stop georg bush from escal thi war __PUNCT__
and i think all of us have a person respons __PUNCT__ if we believ __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ and that what the subject wa that you were talk about __PUNCT__ if we believ that it is moral wrong to escal thi war __PUNCT__ and it is strateg wrong to escal war __PUNCT__
what i have said is it is not enough to give speech __PUNCT__ to talk to polit pundit __PUNCT__ to pass nonbind resolut __PUNCT__
we have to step to the plate and show some courag and do what right on behalf of these men and women who ar serv in iraq and on behalf of that __PUNCT__ peopl in that region of the world __PUNCT__
the countri and the world is ow that from us __PUNCT__
it at such a critic point in america histori that we have to stand up and show some backbon __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if you were in the senat __PUNCT__ would you vote to cut off fund for the war __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i not run for the senat __PUNCT__ i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
what i would do is __PUNCT__ is sai we not go to fund an escal of thi war __PUNCT__
that what i think we should do __PUNCT__
i would not cut off fund for the men and women who ar part of our troop and serv in __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we know that a signific number __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ i think most of the troop who ar part of the surg __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ there wa a disturb report in the last coupl of dai that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ plu troop mai turn into __NUM__ troop __PUNCT__ becaus there __NUM__ __PUNCT__ plu combat troop who will have to be support __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ will be veri surpris to most of america who heard the presid speak about thi __PUNCT__
but we know most of them ar alreadi there __PUNCT__ and what actual go to happen is __PUNCT__ in anbar provinc where the marin ar __PUNCT__ around baghdad where the armi is __PUNCT__ their deploy ar go to be extend __PUNCT__
and these ar men and women who ar alreadi on their second __PUNCT__ third __PUNCT__ mani of them __PUNCT__ their second and third deploy __PUNCT__
thei deserv to come home __PUNCT__
their famili deserv for them to come home __PUNCT__
and what i sai is that the men and women in congress who have a vote __PUNCT__ and those of us who have a __PUNCT__ a platform to talk about thi nation __PUNCT__ we have a respons to those men and women __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ i actual believ that what the presid and chenei ar count on is that what we do is we talk about it __PUNCT__ we complain about it __PUNCT__ we talk about how bad the escal is __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ we go along __PUNCT__
we cannot go along __PUNCT__
we cannot enabl thi presid to make anoth in a __PUNCT__ in a terribl seri of bad mistak __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so stop fund for the moni that would be pai for the surg __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ that would pai for the escal __PUNCT__ that correct __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ anoth oppon in the democrat race for the presid is barack obama of illinoi __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ of __NUM__ he wa a state senat in the illinoi legislatur __PUNCT__
he came out against the war __PUNCT__ and i want to share hi word with you and our viewer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i know that saddam pose no immin and direct threat to the unit state __PUNCT__ or to hi neighbor __PUNCT__ that the iraqi economi is in shambl __PUNCT__ that the iraqi militari is a fraction of it former strength __PUNCT__ and that in concert with the intern commun he can be contain until __PUNCT__ in the wai of all petti dictat __PUNCT__ he fall awai into the dustbin of histori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i know that even a success war against iraq will requir a u. __PUNCT__ occup of undetermin length __PUNCT__ at undetermin cost __PUNCT__ with undetermin consequ __PUNCT__
i know that an invas of iraq without a clear rational and without strong intern support will onli fan the flame of the middl east __PUNCT__ and encourag the worst __PUNCT__ rather than best __PUNCT__ impuls of the arab world __PUNCT__ and strengthen the recruit arm of al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__
i am not oppos to all war __PUNCT__
i oppos to dumb war __PUNCT__
hi judgment wa on the monei __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ he __PUNCT__ he correct __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i will sai __PUNCT__ he wasn't burden __PUNCT__ like a lot of us with the inform that we were receiv on the intellig committe __PUNCT__
and as member of the unit state senat __PUNCT__ we were get veri intim __PUNCT__ detail inform about what wa actual happen in iraq __PUNCT__
senat obama __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ what you say? __PUNCT__ wa a state senat at the time __PUNCT__
so he obvious wasn't __PUNCT__ wasn't in the congress and wasn't part of the __PUNCT__ of the decis make __PUNCT__
but a lot of those predict turn out to be true __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but why shouldn't voter in democrat primari sai __PUNCT__ on the big issu of the war __PUNCT__ obama wa right __PUNCT__ edward wa wrong __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i wa wrong __PUNCT__
thei should sai that __PUNCT__
and the question becom __PUNCT__ who best suit to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ who ha the depth __PUNCT__ the matur __PUNCT__ the judgment to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ and what i would sai to anybodi is i take full respons for what i did __PUNCT__ i should be held account for that __PUNCT__ but i do think it matter when you will to be open and honest with voter about what you done __PUNCT__
i think it realli import that the next presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ and i not critic anybodi __PUNCT__ certainli not senat obama __PUNCT__
but i think it realli import that the next presid of the unit sate be a good __PUNCT__ decent __PUNCT__ honor human be who open and honest with the countri becaus that is the onli wai we go to re __PUNCT__ establish trust between the american peopl and the presid __PUNCT__
and i also think it go to be realli import to re __PUNCT__ establish trust between america and the world __PUNCT__ becaus the presid is __PUNCT__ in effect __PUNCT__ the personif of america __PUNCT__
and when the presid __PUNCT__ what i believ __PUNCT__ on of the thing i do believ the presid need to do is __PUNCT__ in the first __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ travel the world __PUNCT__ not just meet with leader __PUNCT__ but speak to the peopl of the world the wai great american presid have in the past __PUNCT__
the famou john kennedi __PUNCT__ i am a berlin __PUNCT__ speech is an exampl __PUNCT__
and for that to work and for us to spread a messag that america doesn't toler divers __PUNCT__ we embrac divers __PUNCT__ differ cultur __PUNCT__ differ faith belief __PUNCT__ it the heart of who we ar __PUNCT__ that spokesperson is go to have to be somebodi that the rest of the world look up to and respect __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you believ that senat clinton ha been open and honest about her support of the war in iraq __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't know the answer to that question __PUNCT__ honestli __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ i can't __PUNCT__ i can't __PUNCT__ i don't know what insid her __PUNCT__ her head and her heart about thi __PUNCT__
i can't tell whether there ar polit calcul go on __PUNCT__
i just don't know __PUNCT__
but i think __PUNCT__ as we go __PUNCT__ that what campaign ar about __PUNCT__
i have a high opinion of senat clinton __PUNCT__
she done a remark job as a u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ but be presid of the unit state is a differ test __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ through the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__ all of us __PUNCT__ not just me or senat clinton or senat obama __PUNCT__ but all the democrat candid and all the republican candid ar go to be scrutin for whether thei have the charact to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and thei should be __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you mention the vote in the senat __PUNCT__ and thi is what you said about it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that nonbind resolut against iraq troop surg favor by barack obama __PUNCT__ useless __PUNCT__ said edward __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ exactli like a child stand in the corner and stomp hi feet __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ true __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so the democrat shouldn't vote for the resolut against the presid surg __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ oh no __PUNCT__ it fine to vote for the resolut __PUNCT__ but the __PUNCT__ complain at thi histor moment in american histori is not enough __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we won the elect __PUNCT__
we now in charg of the hous and the senat __PUNCT__
we have __PUNCT__ we have the power to actual do someth about thi escal __PUNCT__
i total understand that there ar polit consequ from __PUNCT__ from show that strength and courag __PUNCT__
but i think it necessari __PUNCT__
i think it what america need from us __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but if democrat vote to cut off fund for the troop who ar part of the surg __PUNCT__ the accus would be thei not support the men and women __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ but there a veri easi wai to do thi __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i saw you question senat kennedi on the show about thi __PUNCT__
senat kennedi actual ha a bill that __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ what it sai is __PUNCT__ in order __PUNCT__ if it pass into law __PUNCT__ in order for more troop abov the level that ar there now to be put into iraq __PUNCT__ the presid would first have to come to congress __PUNCT__ and thei us their fund author as the basi for thi __PUNCT__ would have to come to congress and get their permiss __PUNCT__
and i don't believ the congress would give him that permiss under the circumst __PUNCT__
so there __PUNCT__ there an easi __PUNCT__ straightforward wai to do thi __PUNCT__ but we __PUNCT__ we have to have the strength to do it __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ senat joe biden __PUNCT__ anoth oppon in the democrat race for the white hous __PUNCT__ had some thing to sai about your iraq polici in the new york observ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i don't think john edward know what the heck he talk about __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ biden said __PUNCT__ when ask about mr __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ advocaci of the immedi withdraw of about __NUM__ american troop from iraq __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ john edward want you and all the democrat to think __PUNCT__ i want us out of there __PUNCT__ but when you come back and sai __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__
what about the chao that will ensu __PUNCT__ do we have ani interest __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__ left in the region __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ john will have to answer ye or no __PUNCT__
if he sai ye __PUNCT__ what ar thei __PUNCT__ what ar those interest __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__ how do you protect those interest __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__ if you ar complet withdrawn __PUNCT__ ar you withdrawn from the region __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__ ar you withdrawn from iraq __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__ in what period __PUNCT__ so all thi stuff is like so much fluffernutt out there __PUNCT__
so for me __PUNCT__ what i think you have to do is have a strateg notion __PUNCT__
and thei mai have it __PUNCT__ thei ar just smart enough not to enunci it __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ fluffernutt __PUNCT__ huh __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ did you ever have on __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ i,i actual saw senat biden talk about thi interview on televis a few dai ago __PUNCT__
i think thi is __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ part of the same interview where he critic senat clinton also __PUNCT__ and also talk about senat obama __PUNCT__ which ha gotten so much attent __PUNCT__
i think he just __PUNCT__ i think he had bad inform __PUNCT__
he misunderstood __PUNCT__ base on what i heard him sai __PUNCT__ what i wa sai that we should do in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you ar call for an immedi withdraw of __NUM__ troop __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ that i am __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__

edward __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and thi is what the intellig commun said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if coalit forc were withdrawn rapidli __PUNCT__
we judg that thi almost certainli would lead to a signific increas in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in iraq __PUNCT__ intensifi sunni resist to the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ and have advers consequ for nation reconcili __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if such a rapid withdraw were to take place __PUNCT__ we judg that the __PUNCT__ iraqi secur forc __PUNCT__ would be unlik to surviv as a nonsectarian nation institut __PUNCT__ neighbor countri __PUNCT__
might interven openli in the conflict __PUNCT__ massiv civilian casualti and forc popul displac would be probabl __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ qaeda in iraq __PUNCT__ would attempt to us part of the countri __PUNCT__ particularli al __PUNCT__ anbar provinc __PUNCT__ to plan increas attack in and outsid of iraq __PUNCT__
thei talk about your plan __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ can we step back __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ pleas __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ i respond to that specif __PUNCT__
if we can step back for a minut __PUNCT__ becaus we realli haven't talk about what i think __PUNCT__ as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ we should do __PUNCT__ if i were presid todai __PUNCT__ what we should do in iraq __PUNCT__
i think everyon recogn that what happen on the ground in iraq is a direct result of the sunni __PUNCT__ the baathist have been in __PUNCT__ in power for a long period of time under saddam __PUNCT__ and now __PUNCT__ as a minor __PUNCT__ and now the shia and the maliki __PUNCT__ led govern ar in charg __PUNCT__ and thei feel exclud __PUNCT__
thei think thei on the outsid __PUNCT__ which thei larg ar __PUNCT__ legal and constitution __PUNCT__
and that feed the violenc __PUNCT__
it is the foundat for the violenc __PUNCT__
there ar other contributor __PUNCT__ which everyon recogn __PUNCT__
certainli the foreign fighter __PUNCT__ the terrorist __PUNCT__ the shia militia ar all contribut to the ongo violenc __PUNCT__
but the basic foundat for the violenc is veri clear __PUNCT__ which is why i and other __PUNCT__ the baker group __PUNCT__ determin that the onli solut is not a militari solut __PUNCT__ but a polit resolut __PUNCT__ a polit reconcili __PUNCT__
so the start place for me in analyz what we should be do in iraq __PUNCT__ to creat the __PUNCT__ creat the greatest chanc for success __PUNCT__ and i caveat what i about to sai with what you just read and what is in the rest of that n.i.e __PUNCT__ report from __PUNCT__ from thi week __PUNCT__ which is the condit ar horrend in iraq __PUNCT__
not __PUNCT__ and there __PUNCT__ what basic happen is there a polit track and there a secur track __PUNCT__ and thei terribl on both front __PUNCT__
so everyon recogn thi place could go chaotic no matter what you do __PUNCT__ and i be the first to sai that __PUNCT__
but the question is what do we do to try to get the maliki __PUNCT__ shia __PUNCT__ led govern to bring the sunni in __PUNCT__ so as to have a bui __PUNCT__ in to a long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ stabl govern __PUNCT__ what do we do to get the sunni __PUNCT__ disorgan as thei ar __PUNCT__ leadership to try to contribut to a bui __PUNCT__ in to the __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ to a polit reconcili __PUNCT__ and the presid plan is we put __NUM__ __PUNCT__ plu more troop into iraq __PUNCT__
i think all that doe is enabl the continu bad behavior __PUNCT__ polit bad behavior that we seen over the last few year __PUNCT__
what we need to do instead __PUNCT__ in my judgment __PUNCT__ is to shift thi respons to them __PUNCT__
it is the most like wai to creat thi polit reconcili __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the argument by senat mccain and other would be as long as the condit on the ground __PUNCT__ and that what you __PUNCT__ on the ground is as bad as it is __PUNCT__ and that what you just read from the n.i.e __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ is as bad as __PUNCT__ as it is __PUNCT__ polit reconcili is imposs __PUNCT__
i think thei got it exactli backward __PUNCT__
i don't think there ani chanc that these two group ar go to reach ani kind of reconcili until thei feel immin respons __PUNCT__
we cannot continu to prop them up __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i would add that i think it would be foolish for the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ if we go through thi process __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ what i think the process should be is withdraw __PUNCT__ as you point out __PUNCT__ on piec of it __PUNCT__ __NUM__ troop now from the more secur area of iraq __PUNCT__ continu to draw down american troop __PUNCT__ combat troop over the cours of the next __NUM__ __PUNCT__ plu month __PUNCT__ make it clear to the __PUNCT__ to the leadership __PUNCT__ both the sunni and __PUNCT__ and maliki and __PUNCT__ and the shia that thei go to have to take respons for thi __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ engag not just our friend in that region of the world __PUNCT__ the saudi __PUNCT__ the jordanian __PUNCT__ the egyptian __PUNCT__ but engag directli with iran and syria __PUNCT__ becaus both iran and syria have an interest in iraq not go total chaotic __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ if you just look __PUNCT__ for a moment __PUNCT__ just think about iran __PUNCT__
thei in a situat where __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ it should be point out that iran ha actual particip in support __PUNCT__ while thei have done some bad thing __PUNCT__ thei provid suppli __PUNCT__ equip to these shia militia __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ thei have been fairli support of the shia __PUNCT__ led govern in __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__
so what is iran interest in thi __PUNCT__ iran interest is first of all in not have __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a million __PUNCT__ plu refuge come across their western border __PUNCT__ which could clearli happen with an all __PUNCT__ out civil war within iraq __PUNCT__
their __PUNCT__ their second interest is thei ar shia __PUNCT__ shia __PUNCT__ domin countri __PUNCT__ iraq is a shia __PUNCT__ domin countri in a sunni __PUNCT__ domin muslim world __PUNCT__
thei about __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent of the muslim world __PUNCT__
so if thi thing were to actual go complet to pot and to spill over __PUNCT__ and it becam a broader middl east conflict __PUNCT__ thei ar veri much in the minor __PUNCT__
and i can assur you thei understand that __PUNCT__
so we have leverag in deal with iraq __PUNCT__
similar leverag __PUNCT__ leverag with sunni __PUNCT__
thei don't want to see the refuge come across their border __PUNCT__ syria __PUNCT__ i sorri __PUNCT__
thei don't want to see the refuge come across their border __PUNCT__ thei sunni not shia __PUNCT__
but thei also have an interest in not see thi thing go chaotic __PUNCT__
but thei will never particip in stabil the countri as long as we ar the occupi forc there __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ you withdrew __NUM__ troop and the situat wa __PUNCT__ in your word __PUNCT__ total chaotic __PUNCT__ would you have the option of bring the troop back into iraq __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i can tell you exactli what i do as presid __PUNCT__
i start draw the troop down __PUNCT__
i bring out the __NUM__ to begin with __PUNCT__
i continu the process in a veri thought __PUNCT__ orderli wai with __PUNCT__ with the suggest of my militari command on the ground __PUNCT__
the second thing i would do is i have veri close __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ hour __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ dai monitor of what happen with the situat on the ground to see if it __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ deterior __PUNCT__
as we reduc our presenc over time __PUNCT__ i think we need to keep troop in the region __PUNCT__
the redeploy __PUNCT__ i believ some __PUNCT__ some american men and women should come home __PUNCT__ some should go into kuwait __PUNCT__ some should go into afghanistan __PUNCT__ which we haven't talk about __PUNCT__ which is move south __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__
the taliban resurg __PUNCT__ heroin trade is wai up __PUNCT__
so those ar the thing i would do __PUNCT__
the troop __PUNCT__ i keep __PUNCT__ i keep an abl presenc in the persian gulf __PUNCT__ and then i would watch and monitor what happen __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ at the __PUNCT__ simultan with that __PUNCT__ i would be work with both my intellig leader and my militari command to develop a polici about __PUNCT__ a plan __PUNCT__ not a polici __PUNCT__ about what we would do in the case thi thing blow into total civil war __PUNCT__
hard to predict __PUNCT__
you don't know how __PUNCT__ how __PUNCT__ how bad it would be __PUNCT__
but you clearli would have to have some mechan for contain so that thi thing doesn't spill over __PUNCT__
you want the syrian and the iranian to be involv with that __PUNCT__ the saudi __PUNCT__ the kuwaiti __PUNCT__ everybodi that __PUNCT__ that border __PUNCT__ border iraq __PUNCT__
and there some obviou thing to do __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i thought __PUNCT__ i saw that ken pollack discuss thi on your show last week __PUNCT__
but you need to plan for everi possibl __PUNCT__
becaus the overwhelm messag from thi n.i.e __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the democrat will pick out their stuff that thei want to argu and the republican will pick out their stuff __PUNCT__
the overwhelm messag __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ is we ar in a terribl place in iraq __PUNCT__ and the choic ar bad and wors __PUNCT__ and we have to prepar for __PUNCT__ for the worst possibl __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you think that the bush administr is plan for a war in iran __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__
i don't know __PUNCT__
i hope not __PUNCT__
i don't know __PUNCT__
i think that there a legitim concern about iran get a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we should be concern about that for a lot of reason __PUNCT__ includ the possibl that __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ that thei would us it __PUNCT__ second __PUNCT__ that it could __PUNCT__ could nuclear the middl east __PUNCT__ the most volatil place on the planet __PUNCT__
but what disturb is that we not deal with thi in a smart wai at all __PUNCT__ in my judgment __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ what we got is a radic leader __PUNCT__ ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ who bellicos in hi rhetor about america __PUNCT__ bellicos in hi rhetor about nuclear weapon and about israel __PUNCT__ but he is not polit stabl in hi own countri __PUNCT__
he is __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ the polit elit have larg left him __PUNCT__ there ar religi leader who have left him __PUNCT__
he wa elect on a platform of econom reform and strengthen the middl class and lift peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__
he hasn't done anyth about ani of those thing __PUNCT__
what he do instead is he give speech and he travel around the world draw attent to himself __PUNCT__
and what thi ha done is it ha begun to isol him from hi own peopl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what would strengthen him __PUNCT__ a militari strike by america against iran would strengthen him __PUNCT__
thei would ralli around thi gui __PUNCT__
on top of that __PUNCT__ we would see retali __PUNCT__
it be hard for them to get to us __PUNCT__ except through terrorist __PUNCT__ but thei __PUNCT__ we got __NUM__ __PUNCT__ plu american men and women right next door __PUNCT__ and there __PUNCT__ a lot of us believ that there an infrastructur for retali if that were to happen __PUNCT__
what __PUNCT__ what much smarter for us to do __PUNCT__ certainli now __PUNCT__ for the time be __PUNCT__ no american presid should ever take ani option off the tabl __PUNCT__ but what smarter for us to do now is to continu to tap into thi grow isol between thi radic leader and hi own peopl __PUNCT__
and what should be done __PUNCT__ in my judgment __PUNCT__ is we ought __PUNCT__ we ought to work with our friend in europ __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ the bank institut in europ have been pretti good about be tough on iranian bank __PUNCT__
the govern have been less good __PUNCT__
but we ought to put an offer of both stick and carrot on the tabl __PUNCT__
we ought to make it clear that there ar thing that america and the european ar will to do __PUNCT__ it be great if we could get the russian and the chines to particip __PUNCT__ but certainli the european __PUNCT__ thei have econom leverag with iran __PUNCT__
and those thing includ make the nuclear fuel avail to them __PUNCT__ control the cycl __PUNCT__ thi ha been offer befor __PUNCT__ but combin that with a set of econom incent that will be veri attract to the peopl in __PUNCT__ in iran who alreadi feel an isol from thi presid __PUNCT__
and then on the stick side sai __PUNCT__ but there will be consequ if you don't give up your nuclear program __PUNCT__
and the consequ ar the econom declin that you see within your own countri will be acceler __PUNCT__ and it will be acceler becaus the bank __PUNCT__ the bank in europ and the european govern will not continu to do econom busi with iran __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ would presid edward allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ there no answer to that question at thi moment __PUNCT__
i think that it a __PUNCT__ it a __PUNCT__ it a veri bad thing for iran to get a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
i think we have __PUNCT__ we have mani step in front of us that have not been us __PUNCT__
we ought to negoti directli with the iranian __PUNCT__ which ha not __PUNCT__ not been done __PUNCT__
the thing that i just talk about __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ar the right approach in deal with iran __PUNCT__
and then we __PUNCT__ we see what the result is __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but thei mai get on __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ i think the __PUNCT__ we don't know __PUNCT__ and you have to make a judgment as you go along __PUNCT__ and that what i would do as presid __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you said thi about presid bush in answer to thi question __PUNCT__ you don't believ presid bush is a good man in difficult circumst try to do the right thing __PUNCT__ edward wa __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i don't believ it __PUNCT__
i don't __PUNCT__ edward said __PUNCT__
you don't believ he a good man __PUNCT__ or you don't think he try to do the right thing __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ the context in which that discuss took place wa i wa describ what i want to see and __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ most of america want to see from their presid when he spoke about iraq a few week ago __PUNCT__
and hi polici is obvious enorm import __PUNCT__
but beyond that __PUNCT__ i think what american want in their presid __PUNCT__ particularli in these hard __PUNCT__ we in veri difficult __PUNCT__ histor time __PUNCT__
i think thei want a presid that thei feel like thei can trust and who be open and honest with them about how difficult circumst ar __PUNCT__ what the possibl ar __PUNCT__ and to feel like __PUNCT__ even though it hard __PUNCT__ even though it difficult __PUNCT__ and even though the presid mai not be do what thei would do under the same circumst __PUNCT__ that he a good and decent human be that thei believ is try to do everyth he can __PUNCT__
i did not see that in georg bush speech __PUNCT__
what i saw in georg bush speech wa a continu of try to sell the american peopl about what happen in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ we go to take a quick break and come back and talk about health care and a whole lot more __PUNCT__
more of our convers with john edward __PUNCT__

i want to show that clip and come back and talk about it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ dnc winter meet __PUNCT__ fridai __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ can we final sai we stand now and forev for everi singl man __PUNCT__ woman and child in america have health care __PUNCT__ univers health care __PUNCT__ we will leav no on behind __PUNCT__
we will not allow a singl famili or a singl child in america to not have health care coverag and to not have the health care that thei need and deserv __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ univers health care __PUNCT__ nobl goal __PUNCT__ but that __NUM__ million more men __PUNCT__ women and children __PUNCT__
how much would that cost and what kind of plan would you propos __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ it cost between __NUM__ and __NUM__ billion a year onc it __PUNCT__ onc it fulli implement __PUNCT__
i will __PUNCT__ on thi show and tomorrow __PUNCT__ be lai out detail of a univers health care plan __PUNCT__
basic __PUNCT__ we start with the problem __PUNCT__ which ar __PUNCT__ we want to get __PUNCT__ make sure that the __NUM__ million peopl who don't have health care coverag ar cover immedi __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we want to do __PUNCT__ deal with the cost that middl class famili __PUNCT__ who mai have health care coverag but ar worri about pai for it __PUNCT__ worri about keep it __PUNCT__
premium ar up __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ liter __NUM__ percent just over the last few year __PUNCT__
so i want to do someth to bring cost down for other __PUNCT__
and we want to creat some effici that allow competit __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and then final __PUNCT__ here __PUNCT__ here the bottom line __PUNCT__
we want to make sure everybodi cover __PUNCT__ we want to help middl class famili with the cost __PUNCT__ we want __PUNCT__ we want to try to creat competit that doesn't exist todai __PUNCT__
and i think the best __PUNCT__ most effect wai to do that i __PUNCT__ which is what my plan will be as i lai it out tomorrow __PUNCT__ is we take the __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million peopl who don't have health care coverag __PUNCT__ we expand medicaid __PUNCT__ we provid subsidi for peopl who don't have coverag __PUNCT__
we ask employ to plai a bigger role __PUNCT__ which mean thei either have to have coverag __PUNCT__ or thei have to bui into what we call health market __PUNCT__
we go to creat health market all across the countri which will help provid some of these effici __PUNCT__
on of the choic __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ avail in these health market is the govern plan __PUNCT__
so peopl who like the idea of a singl __PUNCT__ payer insur health plan __PUNCT__ that is actual on of the altern that peopl can choos __PUNCT__
thei be allow to choos __PUNCT__
we expand schip __PUNCT__ we expand medicaid __PUNCT__
the bottom line is we ask everybodi to share in the respons of make health care work in thi countri __PUNCT__
employ __PUNCT__ those who ar in the medic insur busi __PUNCT__ employe __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__ everyon will have to contribut in order to make thi work __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ would you be will to rais tax in order to help pai for thi __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we have to rais tax __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ the onli wai you can pai for a health care plan __PUNCT__ from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ that cost anywher from __MONEY__ billion to __MONEY__ billion is there ha to be a revenu sourc __PUNCT__
the revenu sourc for pai for the plan that i propos is __PUNCT__ is first we get rid of georg bush tax cut for peopl who make over __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
thi plan __PUNCT__ in and of itself __PUNCT__ creat some effici and help to reduc the cost of health care global in america __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ we need to do a much better job of collect the tax that ar __PUNCT__ that ar alreadi ow __PUNCT__
and a veri specif exampl of someth we should do __PUNCT__ we should have brokerag hous report the capit gain that __PUNCT__ that peopl ar incur __PUNCT__ becaus we lose billion and billion of dollar in tax revenu __PUNCT__ and billion and billion of dollar from capit gain not be report __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you be will to increas tax to provid health care __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ what about social secur and medicar __PUNCT__ there __NUM__ million peopl on social secur and medicar now __PUNCT__
the next __NUM__ year it go to go to __NUM__ million __PUNCT__
the chairmen of the feder reserv sai __PUNCT__ if we do noth __PUNCT__ you have to rais tax by a third and cut all the rest of govern by __NUM__ percent in order to meet those demand and expect of the entitl program __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we have a huge challeng on thi front __PUNCT__
i think the start place is medicar __PUNCT__ not social secur __PUNCT__ simpli becaus social secur is stronger __PUNCT__ longer __PUNCT__ significantli longer than medicar __PUNCT__
so let me __PUNCT__ if i can __PUNCT__ start with __PUNCT__ with medicar __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ medicar ha veri seriou short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ intens financi problem __PUNCT__ and there __PUNCT__ and there ar thing we can do that we not do __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ we ought to have much better chronic care manag than we have todai __PUNCT__
we ought to be invest in a seriou and system wai in prevent care __PUNCT__ which we not do todai __PUNCT__
and we have signific fraud and abus in the medicar system __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ everi studi that been done demonstr that __PUNCT__
so i think there ar thing we can do to strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
and we ought to be us like __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ in my univers health care plan __PUNCT__ we creat these health market which requir provid to __PUNCT__ to compet against each other __PUNCT__
we ought to be us the power of the feder govern to negoti better price in medicar __PUNCT__
and it wa a __PUNCT__ it wa a foolish thing __PUNCT__ in the medicar prescript drug law that wa pass __PUNCT__ which i vote against __PUNCT__ to not allow the govern to us it market power to negoti better price __PUNCT__
and those ar all thing we can do that will help __PUNCT__ help strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ in term of medicar and social secur __PUNCT__ life expect is now __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
would you consid rais the ag of elig __PUNCT__ would you consid look at cost of __PUNCT__ cost of live increas __PUNCT__ would you look at mean test __PUNCT__ would everyth be on the tabl __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ here __PUNCT__ here what i think we go to have to do __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ in both case __PUNCT__
thi is such a hot polit issu that it will requir seriou __PUNCT__ thi is the on area where it will requir realli seriou bipartisan effort to get anyth done __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thi ha been approach and approach and approach in the past __PUNCT__
but i do have __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and so what i would do is __PUNCT__ let me first sai what i would do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ i would bring togeth leader on both side and expert and put __PUNCT__ try to put togeth someth that would work on both social secur and __PUNCT__ and medicar __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ but i just have to put on caveat in here __PUNCT__
i heard your descript about peopl ar live longer __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thi appli to my own father and your __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ peopl who __PUNCT__ who have __PUNCT__ we still have a lot of peopl in thi countri who work veri __PUNCT__ veri hard and __PUNCT__ when thei reach retir ag __PUNCT__ thei deserv to be abl to retir __PUNCT__
and i just think we can't ignor the fact that we have made a social contract with million and million of american __PUNCT__ and we can't go out there and just yank it out from under them __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but what about for american __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ who ar __NUM__ and younger __PUNCT__ the next gener __PUNCT__ could you establish someth differ for them __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think there multipl wai to do it __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we could do __PUNCT__ on exampl is __PUNCT__ we now have a cap on __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ on the tax that paid __PUNCT__
about __PUNCT__ it about __MONEY__
and doe that cap make sens __PUNCT__ mayb not __PUNCT__
do we need to be __PUNCT__ do we need __PUNCT__ perhap to __PUNCT__ if we go to rais the cap or elimin the cap __PUNCT__ do we need to have a bubbl for middl incom famili that earn over __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ mayb __PUNCT__
i think there __PUNCT__ i think there tool avail to us __PUNCT__ and we certainli do need to deal with it __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ after iowa __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ the caucu next year __PUNCT__ you do well in iowa __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i win there __PUNCT__ accord to the poll __PUNCT__
i don't know if i believ them __PUNCT__ but thei sai i win __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ next stop is nevada __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__
big issu there is yucca mountain __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ nuclear repositori __PUNCT__
you vote against make that a nation repositori __PUNCT__ then you vote for make it a nation repositori __PUNCT__ sai that __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ and that start to have a familiar ring __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you vote __PUNCT__ you vote for it befor you vote against it __PUNCT__
but the thing __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ you said that __PUNCT__ not me __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but now you sai that mayb the nuclear wast should be store local where the wast wa produc __PUNCT__
is that your posit __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ my posit is that __PUNCT__ that what happen with yucca mountain is there been seriou question __PUNCT__ includ the __PUNCT__ the possibl of ly and fraud in the scientif evid of __PUNCT__ that yucca mountain would work __PUNCT__
i wa alwai concern __PUNCT__ still am __PUNCT__ about thi nuclear wast be transport around the countri __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ at thi point in time __PUNCT__ it doe not make sens to do __PUNCT__ to do yucca mountain __PUNCT__
so the __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ the answer is we have nuclear plant __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ the stuff ha to be store __PUNCT__ wast ha to be store somewher __PUNCT__ so it ha to be store where the plant ar __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so in __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ or in the vicin __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so in seabrook __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ the nuclear wast ha to be store in new hampshir __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ it ha to be store somewher close by __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ gai marriag __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ i can't imagin why you ask about new hampshir __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ it next up after nevada __PUNCT__
gai marriag __PUNCT__
you said thi __PUNCT__ it is __PUNCT__ a hard issu __PUNCT__ becaus i __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
i grew up in a small town in the rural south __PUNCT__
i wa rais in the southern baptist church and so i have a belief system that aris from that __PUNCT__
it part of who i am __PUNCT__
i can't make it disappear __PUNCT__
i person feel great conflict about that __PUNCT__
i don't know the answer __PUNCT__
i wish i did __PUNCT__
i think from my perspect it veri easi for me to sai __PUNCT__ gai civil union __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ partnership benefit __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ but it is someth that i struggl with __PUNCT__
do i believ thei should have the right to marri __PUNCT__ i just not there yet __PUNCT__
why not __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think it from my own person cultur and faith belief __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ if you had gone on in that same quot __PUNCT__ that i __PUNCT__ i have __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i struggl myself with impos my faith __PUNCT__ my faith belief __PUNCT__
i grew up in the southern baptist church __PUNCT__ i wa baptiz in the southern baptist church __PUNCT__ my dad wa a deacon __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i wa there just a coupl week ago to see my father get an award __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ it just part of who i am __PUNCT__
and the question is whether i __PUNCT__ as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ should impos on the unit state of america my view on gai marriag becaus i know where it come from __PUNCT__
i awar of why i believ what i believ __PUNCT__
and i think there is consensu around thi idea of no discrimin __PUNCT__ partnership benefit __PUNCT__ civil union __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ that certainli a presid who will to lead could lead the countri in the right direct on that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you believ you born gai __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i think that __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ sexual __PUNCT__ i not an expert on sexual orient __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ i think that __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ there a real possibl that peopl ar born gai __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you don't believ __PUNCT__ do you believ that homosexu is a sin __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you believ that openli gai men and women should be abl to serv in the militari __PUNCT__
edward __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__

i think that __PUNCT__ that i start off in a veri strong place __PUNCT__ but that why we have campaign __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ what is your biggest differ with hillari clinton __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i think we have a differ about what we __PUNCT__ from what i heard __PUNCT__ from __PUNCT__ about what we ought to do in iraq right now __PUNCT__
we have a differ __PUNCT__ at least up until now __PUNCT__ about how we feel about the vote that we cast with respect to __PUNCT__ to iraq __PUNCT__
i don't know whether senat clinton will have a univers health care plan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ if she doe __PUNCT__ i haven't heard it yet __PUNCT__
she might __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ i think there ar substanc differ __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and differ with barack obama __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ less so __PUNCT__
i think that barack obama __PUNCT__ becaus he is rel new to nation polit __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ it not as clear to me where he stand on __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ on issu __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and no __PUNCT__ i not fault him for that __PUNCT__ i just __PUNCT__ i think he just hasn't been around as long __PUNCT__ so he doesn't have as long a track record __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you think two year in the u. __PUNCT__ senat is enough experi to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ i don't think the test should be how mani year you been in the unit state senat __PUNCT__
i think the test is do you have the depth and matur and the person characterist of leadership that america need in it presid __PUNCT__ and i think that test will be appli to me __PUNCT__ to senat clinton __PUNCT__ to senat obama __PUNCT__ and everi other person run __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ what the most import lesson you learn from run for presid in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ edward __PUNCT__ that what america need is leadership __PUNCT__ not politician __PUNCT__
