thi elect is unlik ani we have face befor __PUNCT__
the stake ar higher __PUNCT__
and the challeng we face as a nation ar greater than at ani time in memori __PUNCT__
we as a nation must choos whether to do what america ha alwai done in time like these __PUNCT__ chang direct and move boldli into the futur for the sake of our children __PUNCT__ if not for ourselv __PUNCT__ or wander in the same stale direct we have travel in our recent past __PUNCT__
the choic we must make is as import as it is clear __PUNCT__
it is a choic between look back and look forward __PUNCT__
a choic between the wai we alwai done it and the wai we could do it if we dare __PUNCT__
a choic between corpor power and the power of democraci __PUNCT__
between a corrupt and corrod system and a govern that work for us again __PUNCT__
it is caution versu courag __PUNCT__
old versu new __PUNCT__
calcul versu principl __PUNCT__
it is the establish elit versu the american peopl __PUNCT__
it is a choic between the fail compromis of the past and the bright possibl of our futur __PUNCT__
between resign ourselv to two america or fight for the on america we all believ in __PUNCT__
as alwai __PUNCT__ at these moment __PUNCT__ the choic we make is not for us __PUNCT__ but for our children and our great countri __PUNCT__
and thi time __PUNCT__ like no other time __PUNCT__ the consequ for our children ar truli profound __PUNCT__
will we halt global warm __PUNCT__ protect our environ and human from the cataclysm consequ of inact and leav our children a livabl world rich in the resourc that were left to us __PUNCT__ will we prevail against terror by stop those who would harm us and win over the mind of those who have yet to take side so that instead of an ever more danger and war __PUNCT__ torn world __PUNCT__ our children live in a nation that is safe __PUNCT__ strong and onc again view throughout the world as a truli moral leader __PUNCT__ will corpor greed be all we valu as we move further into the global economi __PUNCT__ or will we put worker and famili first __PUNCT__ so that all job pai fair wage __PUNCT__ everi american ha health care and corpor profit work for democraci and not the other wai around __PUNCT__ will we face our futur as individu __PUNCT__ each of us ask __PUNCT__ what in it for me __PUNCT__ or will we return to the central valu that make our nation great __PUNCT__ that we ar all in thi togeth and each of ha a respons to the common good __PUNCT__
the choic we make will determin not just the qualiti of life our children will inherit __PUNCT__ but the fate of the world we leav behind __PUNCT__
to succe for our children where we have too often fail for ourselv __PUNCT__ we must choos a new cours __PUNCT__
those wed to the polici of the 70 __PUNCT__ 80 __PUNCT__ or 90 ar wed to the past __PUNCT__ idea and polici that ar tire __PUNCT__ shop worn and obsolet __PUNCT__
we will find no answer there __PUNCT__
but small think and outdat answer aren't the onli problem with a vision for the futur that is root in nostalgia __PUNCT__
the troubl with nostalgia is that you tend to rememb what you like and forget what you didn't __PUNCT__
it not just that the answer of the past aren't up to the job todai __PUNCT__ it that the system that produc them wa corrupt __PUNCT__ and still is __PUNCT__
it control by big corpor __PUNCT__ the lobbyist thei hire to protect their bottom line and the politician who curri their favor and carri their water __PUNCT__
and it perpetu by a media that too often fawn over the establish __PUNCT__ but fail to serious cover the challeng we face or the solut be propos __PUNCT__
thi is the game of american polit and in thi game __PUNCT__ the interest of regular american don't stand a chanc __PUNCT__
real chang start with be honest __PUNCT__ the system in washington is rig and our govern is broken __PUNCT__
it rig by greedi corpor power to protect corpor profit __PUNCT__
it rig by the veri wealthi to ensur thei becom even wealthier __PUNCT__
at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ it rig by all those who benefit from the establish order of thing __PUNCT__
for them __PUNCT__ more of the same mean more monei and more power __PUNCT__
thei do anyth thei can to keep thing just the wai thei ar __PUNCT__ not for the countri __PUNCT__ but for themselv __PUNCT__
politician who care more about their career than their constitu go along to get elect __PUNCT__
thei make easi promis to voter instead of challeng them to take respons for our countri __PUNCT__
and then thei compromis even those promis to keep the lobbyist happi and the contribut come __PUNCT__
instead of serv the peopl and the nation __PUNCT__ too mani plai the parlor game of washington __PUNCT__ trade favor and campaign monei __PUNCT__ influenc vote and compromis legisl __PUNCT__
it a game that never end __PUNCT__ but everi american know __PUNCT__ it time to end the game __PUNCT__
and it time for the democrat parti __PUNCT__ the parti of the peopl __PUNCT__ to end it __PUNCT__
the choic for our parti could not be more clear __PUNCT__
we cannot replac a group of corpor republican with a group of corpor democrat __PUNCT__ just swap the washington insid of on parti for the washington insid of the other __PUNCT__
the american peopl deserv to know that their presid is not for sale __PUNCT__ the lincoln bedroom is not for rent __PUNCT__ and lobbyist monei can no longer influenc polici in the hous or the senat __PUNCT__
it time to end the game __PUNCT__
it time to tell the big corpor and the lobbyist who have been run thing for too long that their time is over __PUNCT__
it time to challeng politician to put the american peopl interest ahead of their own calcul polit interest __PUNCT__ to look the lobbyist in the ey and just sai no __PUNCT__
and it time for the american peopl to take respons for our govern __PUNCT__ for in our democraci it is truli our __PUNCT__
if we have come to mistrust and question it __PUNCT__ it is becaus we were not vigil against the forc that have taken it from us __PUNCT__
that their game ha plai on for so long is the fault of each of us __PUNCT__ end the game and return govern of the peopl to the peopl is the respons of all of us __PUNCT__
but clean up washington isn't enough __PUNCT__
if we ar go to meet the challeng we face and prevail over them __PUNCT__ two principl must guid us __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we must end the washington game __PUNCT__ but we must also think as big as the challeng we face __PUNCT__
our idea must be bold enough to succe and our govern must be free to enact them without compromis principl or sacrif result __PUNCT__
on without the other isn't good enough __PUNCT__
all the big idea in the world won't make a differ if thei have to go through thi broken system that remain control by big busi and their lobbyist __PUNCT__
and if we fix the system __PUNCT__ but aren't honest with the american peopl about the scope of our challeng and what requir of each of us to meet them __PUNCT__ then we be left with the babi step and increment measur that ar washington poor excus for progress __PUNCT__
as bobbi kennedi said __PUNCT__ if we fail to dare __PUNCT__ if we do not try __PUNCT__ the next gener will harvest the fruit of our indiffer __PUNCT__ a world we did not want __PUNCT__ a world we did not choos __PUNCT__ but a world we could have made better by care more for the result of our labor __PUNCT__
but if we do both __PUNCT__ if we have the courag to offer real chang and the determin to chang washington __PUNCT__ then we will be build the on america we dream of __PUNCT__ where everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child is bless with the same __PUNCT__ great opportun and held to the same __PUNCT__ just rule __PUNCT__
for more than __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ democrat have talk about univers health care __PUNCT__
and for more than __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we gotten nowher __PUNCT__ becaus lobbyist for the big insur compani __PUNCT__ drug compani and hmo spent million to block real reform __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ thei grudgingli allow increment measur that do noth but tinker around the edg __PUNCT__ or wors __PUNCT__ thei hijack reform to improv their own bottom line __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ more american go without health care than ever befor __PUNCT__
instead of prescript drug reform that brought down the cost of drug __PUNCT__ the lobbyist for the big drug compani got us a prescript drug bill that boost drug compani profit but doesn't cut patient cost __PUNCT__
i have a bold plan to final guarante true univers health care for everi singl american and cut health care cost for everyon __PUNCT__
my plan will requir everyon __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ govern and individu __PUNCT__ to contribut someth to reach univers coverag __PUNCT__
and i am honest about the cost __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__ and i pai for it by repeal the bush tax cut for famili abov __MONEY__
if we end the game in washington __PUNCT__ we can final have a health care system that treat the health of all our peopl with equal worth __PUNCT__
depend on foreign oil is smother our economi and choke our environ __PUNCT__
everybodi know it __PUNCT__ politician from both parti have been call for energi independ for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
so what did the oilmen in the white hous do __PUNCT__ thei hand the kei to the corridor of govern over to the lobbyist for the big oil compani and let them liter write the energi bill __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ga price ar through the roof __PUNCT__ carbon emiss ar uncheck __PUNCT__ and global warm is like get wors __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will cap greenhous ga pollut and ratchet it down everi year __PUNCT__
we will avoid mistak like nuclear power and liquid coal __PUNCT__
we will invest in clean renew energi gener in america and creat a new era in effici car __PUNCT__ made by union member here at home __PUNCT__
and look at our econom polici __PUNCT__ from top to bottom __PUNCT__ thei a twist reflect of american valu __PUNCT__
instead of expand opportun for all and prevent special privileg for ani __PUNCT__ thei hoard opportun and protect special privileg for the veri few at the veri top __PUNCT__
trade polici is all about corpor profit for big multin and not at all about lift worker __PUNCT__ wage or creat american job __PUNCT__
the tax code provid break for hedg fund manag __PUNCT__ amazingli __PUNCT__ even democrat back down from ask them to pai their fair share when wall street lobbyist put the pressur on __PUNCT__
by the time a decad of corpor opposit to a minim increas in the minimum wage is overcom __PUNCT__ even it own support admit that the increas isn't enough __PUNCT__ so anoth decad of corpor opposit begin anew __PUNCT__ and worker lose again __PUNCT__
it time we put our economi back in line with our valu __PUNCT__
let restor fair to our tax code by insist on a simpl principl __PUNCT__ nobodi in the middl class should pai higher tax on the monei thei make from hard work than the wealthiest pai on the monei thei make from their invest __PUNCT__
let restor opportun and respons to our trade polici by requir that everi new trade deal put worker and wage first __PUNCT__
let reward work by strengthen union __PUNCT__ rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__ cut tax on work famili and with a nation commit to end poverti within a gener __PUNCT__
and let support our troop and end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__
we should immedi withdraw __NUM__ combat troop immedi and have the rest out in about a year __PUNCT__
and when presid bush refus to act __PUNCT__ congress should us it fund power to forc him to act __PUNCT__
none of thi will be easi __PUNCT__ but all of it is possibl __PUNCT__
