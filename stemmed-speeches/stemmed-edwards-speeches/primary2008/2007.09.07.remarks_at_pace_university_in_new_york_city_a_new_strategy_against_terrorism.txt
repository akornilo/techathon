thank you for have me here todai __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
on a beauti __PUNCT__ bright __DATE__ dai almost six year ago __PUNCT__ a group of __NUM__ men step onto four airplan __PUNCT__ intend to kill as mani peopl as thei could __PUNCT__ intend to terror america __PUNCT__
just a few block from here __PUNCT__ the hijack crash their terribl ideolog into the american dream __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ american di on that horribl dai in new york citi __PUNCT__ in arlington __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ and in shanksvil __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__
thei were banker and busboi __PUNCT__ secretari and firemen __PUNCT__ and thei were all our brother and sister __PUNCT__
their sacrific is a harsh and last remind of what must becom on of the great goal of our gener __PUNCT__ the need to protect our citizen from these horror __PUNCT__ to root out and shut down terrorist cell wherev thei fester __PUNCT__ to remov the poverti and instabl that give radic a toehold __PUNCT__ and to make terror utterli unaccept among nation everywher __PUNCT__ for all time __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ of __NUM__ while georg bush wa in crawford ignor memo about the threat from al qaeda __PUNCT__ i author an op __PUNCT__ ed in which i name terror as the most vital nation secur challeng our countri would face in the come year __PUNCT__
i still believ that todai __PUNCT__
the world stood unit behind america after 9/11 __PUNCT__
but instead of lead a truli visionari campaign against global terror __PUNCT__ our presid led america down a garden path __PUNCT__
he us the attack to justifi a preconceiv war against a nation he now admit had no ti to al qaeda __PUNCT__
he then offer belliger and hostil to the world commun __PUNCT__ and we have been reward in kind __PUNCT__
presid bush __PUNCT__ like the republican follow him todai and even some democrat __PUNCT__ wa stuck in the past __PUNCT__ and he still is __PUNCT__
he had no grasp of the new threat we face __PUNCT__ so he fail to offer a vision to keep us safe in a world that had chang __PUNCT__
saddam hussein wa the threat he knew __PUNCT__ so iraq wa the war he wage __PUNCT__
we need new think and a bold vision to protect the world for our children __PUNCT__ instead __PUNCT__ georg bush liter gave us hi father war __PUNCT__ but without hi father alli or hi father sens of decenc __PUNCT__
what more and what wors __PUNCT__ the so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ war on terror __PUNCT__ he us as hi excus for war in iraq becam hi excus for trampl our constitut and __PUNCT__ most pervers __PUNCT__ for ignor the demand of the actual struggl against terror __PUNCT__
becaus in georg bush realiti __PUNCT__ disagr is call weak __PUNCT__ challeng is suspect __PUNCT__ and opposit downright unpatriot __PUNCT__
six year later __PUNCT__ the devast consequ of the bush __PUNCT__ war on terror __PUNCT__ doctrin ar so clear that hi own administr ha had to admit them __PUNCT__
a recent nation intellig estim found that al qaeda is now as strong as it wa befor 9/11 __PUNCT__
in a recent survei of america most respect foreign polici expert __PUNCT__ the vast major said the world is becom more danger for american and the unit state __PUNCT__
the state depart recent releas a studi show that terror ha increas worldwid __NUM__ percent in __NUM__ includ a __NUM__ percent surg in civilian fatal __PUNCT__
and as everyon here know __PUNCT__ osama bin laden is still at larg __PUNCT__
six year ago __PUNCT__ presid bush declar that he want bin laden __PUNCT__ dead or aliv __PUNCT__
thi is hi starkest failur __PUNCT__
appar __PUNCT__ bin laden plan to address america on the anniversari of 9/11 __PUNCT__
but i don't need to wait and hear what thi murder ha to sai __PUNCT__
my posit is clear __PUNCT__
i can make you thi solemn promis __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will never rest until we have hunt bin laden down and serv him justic __PUNCT__
georg bush approach to terror ha not onli fail to make the world safer __PUNCT__
it ha demolish the foundat of america foreign polici __PUNCT__ our relationship with other countri __PUNCT__
in the first gulf war __PUNCT__ our alli share the cost of troop __PUNCT__ casualti __PUNCT__ and fund __PUNCT__
but in the current iraq war __PUNCT__ the bush approach left us larg on our own __PUNCT__ bear almost all of the burden __PUNCT__
tragic for america and the world __PUNCT__ georg bush __PUNCT__ war on terror __PUNCT__ approach walk directli into the trap the terrorist set for us __PUNCT__
islam extremist want to frame the conflict with the u. __PUNCT__ as a war of civil __PUNCT__ and the bush administr __PUNCT__ stuck in a cold war mental __PUNCT__ happili compli __PUNCT__
there is now onli on kei question we must ask ourselv __PUNCT__ ar we ani closer to get rid of terror than we were six year ago __PUNCT__ and the terribl answer is no __PUNCT__ we further awai __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ terror is wors in iraq __PUNCT__ and it wors around the world __PUNCT__
so what doe all thi mean __PUNCT__ it mean the result ar in on georg bush so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ global war on terror __PUNCT__ and it not just a failur __PUNCT__ it a doubl __PUNCT__ edg failur __PUNCT__
the bush approach hasn't onli made the terror problem wors __PUNCT__
the administr ha rigidli stuck to outdat approach that ar ineffect against the modern terrorist threat __PUNCT__
we need a counterterror polici that will actual counter terror __PUNCT__
that match __NUM__ centuri threat with __NUM__ centuri tactic __PUNCT__
that replac cold war think design to defeat a singl __PUNCT__ implac enemi with new world think that can defeat a multi __PUNCT__ nation __PUNCT__ divers __PUNCT__ and often hidden foe __PUNCT__ not just now __PUNCT__ but for the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
that strong __PUNCT__ fast __PUNCT__ and hard enough to stop terrorist cold __PUNCT__ but also smart __PUNCT__ honest __PUNCT__ and prescient enough to draw peopl awai from terror in the first place __PUNCT__
and to do all of thi __PUNCT__ we must do on thing __PUNCT__
we got to throw awai the fail georg bush polici of the past __PUNCT__ and move in a bold new direct __PUNCT__
instead of cold war institut design to win tradit war and protect tradit border __PUNCT__ we need new institut design to share intellig __PUNCT__ cooper across border __PUNCT__ and take out small __PUNCT__ hostil group __PUNCT__
instead of a foreign polici of conveni that readili doe busi with whoever is avail and regularli turn a blind ey when our alli behav wrongli or fail to cooper __PUNCT__ we need a new foreign polici of convict that requir cooper in exchang for our support __PUNCT__ whether it arm sale __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ or foreign aid __PUNCT__
instead of an exclus short __PUNCT__ term focu on the enemi we know __PUNCT__ we need a long __PUNCT__ term strategi to win the mind of those who ar not yet our enemi __PUNCT__ by offer educ __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ and opportun in place of radic __PUNCT__ hatr and fear __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ instead of a reckless __PUNCT__ solo pursuit of an ideolog agenda that abandon our moral author and disregard our alli __PUNCT__ we need to reengag with the world and reassert our moral leadership __PUNCT__
in a few short dai __PUNCT__ we will all take time to rememb 9/11 __PUNCT__
thi year __PUNCT__ we should all make the anniversari not onli a time of mourn __PUNCT__ but of reflect on the veri real choic we face __PUNCT__
we learn on 9/11 the consequ of not deal with the threat of terror __PUNCT__
you will have a veri real choic to make in thi elect __PUNCT__ and the choic will have consequ __PUNCT__
you and your children will have to live with the decis we make in the next four year __PUNCT__
there is no doubt that some progress ha been made __PUNCT__
we should thank the profession who have uncov plot like the on on john f __PUNCT__ kennedi airport __PUNCT__
our feder govern ha been substanti rearrang __PUNCT__ and mani problem correct __PUNCT__
but we should not let our enthusiasm for short __PUNCT__ term victori cloud the long __PUNCT__ term realiti __PUNCT__
the fact is that georg bush ha us __NUM__ centuri tool to attack __NUM__ centuri problem __PUNCT__
the bush approach ha fail not onli becaus of the shameless polit manipul and reckless decis of the presid and hi aid __PUNCT__
it ha fail becaus the presid is us an antiqu set of weapon against a modern target __PUNCT__ and he misfir __PUNCT__
some politician __PUNCT__ like rudolph giuliani __PUNCT__ mitt romnei __PUNCT__ and john mccain have respond to the shortcom and backfir of the administr approach by essenti doubl __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__
thei have close their ey to the fact and ask us to accept __PUNCT__ on faith __PUNCT__ more of the bush approach __PUNCT__
some run for the democrat nomin have even argu that the bush __PUNCT__ chenei approach ha made us safer __PUNCT__
it ha not __PUNCT__
for the sake of our nation secur __PUNCT__ for the sake of build a safer america __PUNCT__ we must take a new direct __PUNCT__
we need a bold new approach __PUNCT__ on that is smart __PUNCT__ tough __PUNCT__ and target __PUNCT__
thi will requir us to look beyond the structur of world war ii and the cold war to new tool that will allow us to target terror more precis __PUNCT__
it will requir sustain u. __PUNCT__ leadership __PUNCT__ but the kind that leverag the power of partnership __PUNCT__ rather than go it alon __PUNCT__
it will mean rais the level of cooper between law enforc and intellig agenc __PUNCT__ while preserv civil liberti and the rule of law __PUNCT__
we saw the promis of a new multilater approach just a coupl of dai ago in germani __PUNCT__
the terrorist the german author caught were plot massiv attack on american interest __PUNCT__
thei had been train in pakistan __PUNCT__ had a network in turkei __PUNCT__ and were captur through german and american intellig __PUNCT__
we must be abl to coordin similar oper throughout the world __PUNCT__ in the middl east __PUNCT__ asia __PUNCT__ africa __PUNCT__ and anywher terrorist would attack __PUNCT__
now more than ever __PUNCT__ the world is readi for a new direct from america __PUNCT__
the world is readi to work togeth against terror __PUNCT__
but right now __PUNCT__ the commun of nation lack ani global institut to coordin counter __PUNCT__ terrorist intellig and secur oper __PUNCT__
the intern institut of the last centuri were design for world war ii and the cold war __PUNCT__
institut like the unit nation __PUNCT__ nato __PUNCT__ and interpol have taken step to adapt to the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri challeng of terror __PUNCT__ and thei serv valuabl purpos __PUNCT__
and thei remain essenti to fulfil our interest __PUNCT__
but thei cannot be the complet and final answer to shut down global terror __PUNCT__
it the right time for a bold new direct __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a comprehens new counterterror polici that will be defin by two principl __PUNCT__ strength and cooper __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of thi polici will be a new multilater organ call the counterterror and intellig treati organ __PUNCT__ cito __PUNCT__
everi nation ha an interest in shut down terror __PUNCT__
cito will creat connect between a wide rang of nation on terror and intellig __PUNCT__ includ countri on all contin __PUNCT__ includ asia __PUNCT__ africa __PUNCT__ latin america __PUNCT__ and europ __PUNCT__
new connect between previous separ nation will be forg __PUNCT__ creat new possibl __PUNCT__
cito will allow member to voluntarili share financi __PUNCT__ polic __PUNCT__ custom and immigr intellig __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ nation will be abl to track the wai terrorist travel __PUNCT__ commun __PUNCT__ recruit __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ and financ their oper __PUNCT__
and thei will be abl to take action __PUNCT__ through intern team of intellig and nation secur profession who will launch target mission to root out and shut down terrorist cell __PUNCT__
the new organ will also creat a histor new coalit __PUNCT__
those nation who join will __PUNCT__ by work togeth __PUNCT__ show the world the power of cooper __PUNCT__
those nation who join will also be requir to commit to tough criteria about the step thei will take to root out extremist __PUNCT__ particularli those who cross border __PUNCT__
those nation who refus to join will be call out befor the world __PUNCT__
it import to note that cito is not a panacea __PUNCT__ nor will it be perfect __PUNCT__
but it would repres the first step in a new direct __PUNCT__
as presid john f __PUNCT__ kennedi observ when he sign the treati that first limit the test of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ we must begin with the common recognit of a common danger __PUNCT__
presid kennedi said then __PUNCT__ a journei of a thousand mile must begin with a singl step __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ thi new anti __PUNCT__ terror organ would be such a first step __PUNCT__
organ ar onli as strong as the peopl who help make them run __PUNCT__ and so we must also improv the qualiti of our human intellig __PUNCT__ agent better abl to understand local cultur and make local connect in countri with activ terrorist cell __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will lead effort to improv human intellig through __NUM__ new annual scholarship to improv languag skill for student who pursu career in intellig and diplomaci __PUNCT__
a terrorist should not be abl to escap detect in europ or the middl east if a foreign agenc could have caught him with the help of american technolog and advic __PUNCT__
within six month of take offic __PUNCT__ i will direct the secretari of state __PUNCT__ work with the attornei gener and other nation secur offici __PUNCT__ to launch comprehens strategi to support agenc in other countri __PUNCT__
there is no more urgent task than prevent terrorist from acquir a nuclear weapon or anoth weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
and we will all be better off when the world is free of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
diplomaci is kei to progress against nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the recent agreement with north korea to shut down their nuclear program in exchang for the releas of frozen asset is long overdu __PUNCT__ but encourag __PUNCT__
it is tell that the few success of the bush administr come from the diplomaci it ha derid __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will creat a global nuclear compact to strengthen the non __PUNCT__ prolifer treati __PUNCT__ which would support peac nuclear program __PUNCT__ improv secur for exist stock of nuclear materi __PUNCT__ and ensur more frequent verif that materi ar not be divert and facil ar not be misus __PUNCT__
and i will lead an intern effort to rid the world of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
our chemic plant ar also target for terrorist __PUNCT__
a success attack on ani of these target would be devast __PUNCT__
becaus of industri pressur __PUNCT__ new water __PUNCT__ down secur rule impos by the bush administr mai actual weaken secur at mani chemic plant __PUNCT__
i support implement tough new safeti standard at plant vulner to terrorist attack __PUNCT__
we must also work hard here at home to ensur that extremist ideolog do not take hold in our own muslim commun __PUNCT__ and we must do so in a wai that respect divers and civil liberti and avoid practic like racial profil against both arab and muslim __PUNCT__
we must encourag american muslim particip in public life __PUNCT__
i will put new resourc toward engag american muslim __PUNCT__ empow local mosqu to counter extremist idea __PUNCT__ and work hand __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hand with muslim commun to identifi and isol threat __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we must achiev energi independ __PUNCT__
if we reduc our relianc on oil from instabl part of the world __PUNCT__ middl eastern regim will final diversifi their economi and modern their societi __PUNCT__
and fight global climat chang will reduc global disrupt that could lead to tend of million of refuge and creat massiv new breed ground for desper and radic __PUNCT__
there ar those who ar hard __PUNCT__ core propon of terror __PUNCT__ and i have spoken here about how we must deal with them __PUNCT__
yet we also should have a broader __PUNCT__ deeper goal __PUNCT__ to prevent terror from take root in the first place __PUNCT__
million of peopl around the world ar sit on the fenc __PUNCT__
on the on side ar bin laden and al qaeda __PUNCT__ and on the other side is america __PUNCT__
the question is which wai thei will go __PUNCT__
if thei perceiv america as a bulli __PUNCT__ it will drive them in the other direct __PUNCT__
if __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ thei see us as the light __PUNCT__ the countri thei want to be like __PUNCT__ the countri that creat hope and opportun __PUNCT__ it will pull them to us like a magnet __PUNCT__
we have to be that light again __PUNCT__
we need to do everyth we can to prevent thi gener of potenti friend from becom a gener of enemi __PUNCT__
sever month ago __PUNCT__ i propos a sweep effort to elimin the poverti and instabl that creat the condit for extrem __PUNCT__ includ increas our fund for global primari educ to __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__ expand microfin program __PUNCT__ ramp up our support for sanit and prevent health care in develop nation __PUNCT__ and dramat increas our promot of constitut democraci and the rule of law across the develop world __PUNCT__
and dure my first year in offic __PUNCT__ i will establish a __PUNCT__ marshal corp __PUNCT__ pattern after the militari reserv __PUNCT__ that will includ at least __NUM__ civilian expert __PUNCT__
it member will be deploi abroad to serv on reconstruct __PUNCT__ stabil __PUNCT__ and humanitarian mission __PUNCT__
rethink our approach to terror also mean rethink our approach countri by countri __PUNCT__ cell by cell __PUNCT__
and in each place where terror ha taken root __PUNCT__ there is a lot more we can do __PUNCT__
we must begin with on of the greatest gener of terror in the world todai __PUNCT__ iraq __PUNCT__
georg bush fail manag of the war in iraq ha made the problem of terror wors __PUNCT__
the war provid al qaeda with a power tool for recruit terrorist __PUNCT__
it gave them a battlefield for train __PUNCT__
it gave them an attract target __PUNCT__ in american troop __PUNCT__
and it divert the resourc of the u. __PUNCT__ militari __PUNCT__ weaken our forc structur in the process __PUNCT__
even though the presenc of u. __PUNCT__ troop ha serv as an attract target for terrorist __PUNCT__ our eventu withdraw will not remov the threat __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will redeploi troop into quick reaction forc outsid of iraq __PUNCT__ to perform target mission against al qaeda cell and to prevent a genocid or region spillov of a civil war __PUNCT__
we can neglect the crisi in afghanistan no longer __PUNCT__
the taliban is re __PUNCT__ take territori in southern afghanistan and kidnap foreign __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will work with the other member of nato to ensur that our forc and rule of engag ar robust enough to defeat the taliban and protect the democrat govern in afghanistan __PUNCT__
as part of thi effort __PUNCT__ i will commit addit american special forc to root out and shut down taliban cell __PUNCT__
terrorist also take advantag when state don't do enough to stop them __PUNCT__
we ought to us our tremend tool __PUNCT__ whether diplomaci __PUNCT__ arm sale __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ or foreign aid __PUNCT__ to get state to shut down terror __PUNCT__
in pakistan __PUNCT__ the recent nation intellig estim found that al qaeda ha establish a safe haven in the northwest tribal area __PUNCT__
we have given the musharraf govern billion of dollar of aid in the last sever year __PUNCT__ yet thei have done far too littl to get control over these area __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will condit futur american aid on progress by pakistan __PUNCT__ includ strengthen the reach of polic forc and work more effect with tribal leader and their member to ensur their accept of the govern __PUNCT__
but i want to be clear about on thing __PUNCT__ if we have action intellig about immin terrorist activ and the pakistan govern refus to act __PUNCT__ we will __PUNCT__
and saudi arabia is a countri we have given too much in return for too littl __PUNCT__
we must requir the saudi to do more to stop the flow of terrorist to iraq __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will condit futur arm packag on saudi arabia action against terrorist __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ you mai be ask yourself why i am deliv thi speech at a colleg __PUNCT__ instead of a think tank __PUNCT__ why i am talk to a room full of young peopl __PUNCT__ instead of a room full polici expert __PUNCT__
the answer is simpl __PUNCT__
i have spoken of the need to counter __NUM__ centuri threat with __NUM__ centuri strategi __PUNCT__
to do that __PUNCT__ we need __NUM__ centuri mind __PUNCT__
and that mean we need you __PUNCT__
your countri need you __PUNCT__
you mai not agre with the decis that got us to where we ar todai __PUNCT__
you mai not agre with the polici georg bush is current pursu __PUNCT__

but we ar in thi struggl __PUNCT__
we ar in it togeth __PUNCT__ and america need you now more than ever __PUNCT__
while the bush administr us thi struggl to divid us __PUNCT__ i am ask you to rise to the challeng we face todai __PUNCT__

you can work or volunt for an ngo that fight global poverti __PUNCT__
or you can write and talk to your elect repres to keep them honest and make sure thei ar support smart polici that will help us end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
it is these sacrific that will help restor america great __PUNCT__
we must lead the world toward the futur __PUNCT__ and we must take up the mantl of moral leadership that serv us so well in the last centuri __PUNCT__
the campaign against terror will demand tough and creativ __PUNCT__
it will take place in the shadow __PUNCT__ in difficult terrain like the hill of pakistan and the field of afghanistan __PUNCT__ and in the heart and mind of million __PUNCT__
we have a choic todai __PUNCT__ and it rest in your hand __PUNCT__
you ar the gener who will help decid whether america will stick with the fail polici of the past __PUNCT__ or whether we will aim for the horizon __PUNCT__

todai __PUNCT__ we stand on the shoulder of the gener who face those challeng in their own time __PUNCT__ and who rose to meet them __PUNCT__
just as thei rose to meet the enemi thei face __PUNCT__ we must rise to meet our __PUNCT__
and just as thei did __PUNCT__ we rise to meet them as american __PUNCT__
so challeng your leader __PUNCT__ hold them account for creat a safer world __PUNCT__
and challeng yourselv __PUNCT__ hold yourself account for creat a better nation __PUNCT__
