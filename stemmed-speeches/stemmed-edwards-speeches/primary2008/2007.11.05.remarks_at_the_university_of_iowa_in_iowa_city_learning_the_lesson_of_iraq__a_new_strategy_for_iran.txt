thank you for have me here todai __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
five year ago __PUNCT__ the bush administr went to war with iraq __PUNCT__ a war we all know now we did not need to fight __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we see the result of that fate decis __PUNCT__ a civil war with no end in sight __PUNCT__ a black hole in our budget __PUNCT__ and nearli __NUM__ brave men and women in our militari who have paid the ultim price __PUNCT__
a famou philosoph onc observ that those who don't rememb histori ar condemn to repeat it __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ the war in iraq isn't even histori yet __PUNCT__ but the bush administr is repeat the march to war with iran __PUNCT__ and thei get help from peopl who should know a lot better __PUNCT__
georg bush __PUNCT__ dick chenei __PUNCT__ and the neocon warmong us 9/11 to start a war with iraq and now thei try to us iraq to start a war with iran __PUNCT__
and we have to stop them __PUNCT__
we ow our american hero __PUNCT__ the men and women in our arm servic who ar fight so brave in iraq and afghanistan todai __PUNCT__ no less __PUNCT__
mani of our soldier ar the same ag as some of you here todai __PUNCT__ or even younger __PUNCT__
we ow them and their famili thi solemn oath __PUNCT__ we will make everi nation secur decis as carefulli and respons as is humanli possibl __PUNCT__
thi is a critic moment __PUNCT__
as a nation __PUNCT__ we stand todai at a fork in the road with iran __PUNCT__
we have a real choic about the direct we take __PUNCT__
on path will replai the last seven year __PUNCT__
it lead toward a dark futur of belliger __PUNCT__ aggress __PUNCT__ and war __PUNCT__
we need a new direct __PUNCT__ on that will defus the iran threat __PUNCT__ rather than aggrav it __PUNCT__ on that will make america safer __PUNCT__ not make the world more danger __PUNCT__
to understand exactli what the administr is try to do with iran __PUNCT__ we need to go back to the begin of the bush administr and look at how thei took us to war with iraq __PUNCT__
in the spring of __NUM__ the nation wa struggl to recov from the devast terrorist attack of 9/11 __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ a group of bush administr neoconserv __PUNCT__ like dick chenei and paul wolfowitz __PUNCT__ were strateg for wai to start a war with iraq __PUNCT__
and suddenli __PUNCT__ instead of react to 9/11 by work to protect america from terrorist __PUNCT__ thei saw a polit opportun to promot their right __PUNCT__ wing ideolog agenda and demon anyon who disagre with them __PUNCT__
here what you have to know about these neocon __PUNCT__ thei think might make right __PUNCT__ everi time __PUNCT__
thei believ in domin __PUNCT__ not debat __PUNCT__
thei think america should us our militari power to impos our will wherev and whenev we want __PUNCT__
thei us a sledgehamm when we should us a scalpel __PUNCT__
and here what you need to know about georg bush foreign polici __PUNCT__ it written by these neocon __PUNCT__ lock __PUNCT__ stock __PUNCT__ and barrel __PUNCT__
so after 9/11 __PUNCT__ instead of focus on the terrorist threat __PUNCT__ georg bush start promot a radic new neoconserv doctrin he call __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ prevent war __PUNCT__ which would soon becom part of hi argument for war in iraq __PUNCT__
here what thei mean by prevent war __PUNCT__ if we see a possibl threat __PUNCT__ we go to war __PUNCT__ we don't exhaust diplomat __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ and econom option __PUNCT__ we go straight to war __PUNCT__
under thi bush doctrin __PUNCT__ militari forc is no longer the option of last resort __PUNCT__
by __DATE__ of __NUM__ presid bush had includ the new doctrin in hi administr nation secur strategi __PUNCT__ the document that guid our militari in plan our defens __PUNCT__
and then the next month __PUNCT__ congress vote to author the presid to us forc in iraq __PUNCT__
i wa wrong to vote for thi war __PUNCT__
it wa a mistak to give thi presid the author to wage a reckless war in iraq __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i want to be veri clear about someth __PUNCT__
i believ veri strongli that ani command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief must retain the right to respond with appropri forc when there real intellig about an immin threat to america __PUNCT__
but there is a differ between do everyth in our power to keep america safe and a reckless __PUNCT__ belliger polici that actual make us less safe __PUNCT__
the prevent war doctrin wa a stun departur from the polici that had kept america safe dure both world war and dure the cold war __PUNCT__
it is wrong on the merit __PUNCT__ wrong on the moral __PUNCT__ and wrong for america __PUNCT__
harri truman onc said __PUNCT__ there is noth more foolish than to think that war can be stop by war __PUNCT__
you don't __PUNCT__ prevent __PUNCT__ anyth other than peac __PUNCT__
that exactli right __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__ you don't prevent war by start them __PUNCT__
it would be ridicul if it weren't so danger __PUNCT__
thi georg bush polici instead is __PUNCT__ almost liter __PUNCT__ shoot first __PUNCT__ ask question later __PUNCT__
arm with their prevent war doctrin __PUNCT__ the administr us everi excus to march to war __PUNCT__ when he should have taken everi reason step to prevent war __PUNCT__
and the war ha backfir terribl __PUNCT__
it damag america moral reput __PUNCT__ decreas our nation secur __PUNCT__ and increas terror worldwid __PUNCT__
it will take year to repair the damag __PUNCT__ and we must begin by end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
it ha now been exactli a year sinc the american peopl vote for a democrat congress that would end the war __PUNCT__
yet we still have the statu quo __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will immedi withdraw __NUM__ troop __PUNCT__ launch a diplomat offens to invest all local __PUNCT__ nation __PUNCT__ and region parti in the comprehens polit solut that will end the violenc __PUNCT__ and will complet withdraw all combat troop within __NUM__ to __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
the bottom line is simpl __PUNCT__ no combat troop __PUNCT__ no combat mission __PUNCT__ no combat __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
not sometim to be determin __PUNCT__ not by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
by the end of my first year as presid __PUNCT__ by the end of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i believ everi candid for presid ow the american peopl a clear and specif plan for end the iraq war __PUNCT__ and i have done my part __PUNCT__
you deserv to know exactli where we stand __PUNCT__
with less than __NUM__ dai to the caucu __PUNCT__ senat clinton ha still not given specif answer to specif question __PUNCT__
how mani troop will she withdraw __PUNCT__ and when will she withdraw them __PUNCT__ all she said is that she will meet with her gener within two month of take offic __PUNCT__
that not a plan __PUNCT__
that not even a real promis __PUNCT__
it the promis of a plan meet __PUNCT__
what more __PUNCT__ senat clinton want to keep combat troop in iraq to perform combat mission in iraq __PUNCT__
she will extend the war __PUNCT__
i will end the war __PUNCT__
onli in washington would anybodi believ that you can end the war and continu combat __PUNCT__
on a matter as seriou as iraq __PUNCT__ we need honesti and real answer __PUNCT__ not more doubl __PUNCT__ talk __PUNCT__
and all of thi is occur in a veri danger context __PUNCT__ when we badli need leadership that will stand up to the presid __PUNCT__
the neocon ar onc again prepar for war __PUNCT__
defens secretari robert gate recent told report that the administr ha prepar __PUNCT__ conting plan __PUNCT__ for attack __PUNCT__
georg bush ha been roll out reckless rhetor __PUNCT__ sai that __PUNCT__ world war iii __PUNCT__ is just around the corner with iran __PUNCT__
and just over a week ago __PUNCT__ bush and chenei declar the revolutionari guard a terrorist organ and a prolifer of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
we have seen thi movi befor __PUNCT__
and it doesn't end well __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ as we all know too well __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__ it hasn't end at all __PUNCT__
in order to declar the revolutionari guard a terrorist organ __PUNCT__ someth we never done befor for a govern __PUNCT__ run militia __PUNCT__ bush wa support by the senat __PUNCT__
mani in our parti oppos thi vote __PUNCT__ like senat dodd and senat biden __PUNCT__ and i applaud them for that __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ some support it __PUNCT__
senat clinton onc again side with bush and the neocon __PUNCT__ help them rattl their saber and build their case for anoth prevent war __PUNCT__
it clear that senat clinton and i learn veri differ lesson from the run up to the iraq war __PUNCT__
i learn that if you give thi presid an inch __PUNCT__ he will take a mile __PUNCT__ and launch a war __PUNCT__
but senat clinton appar learn a differ lesson __PUNCT__ and she give the administr exactli what it want onc again __PUNCT__
senat clinton is vote like a hawk in washington __PUNCT__ while talk like a dove in iowa and new hampshir __PUNCT__
on of her advisor told the new york time that wa becaus she wa shift from primari mode to gener elect mode __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we onli need on mode from our presid __PUNCT__ tell the truth mode all the time __PUNCT__
so let me be clear __PUNCT__
we should take iran veri serious __PUNCT__
and as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ if i ever learn that ani nation is threaten an immin attack __PUNCT__ i will do what necessari to protect america __PUNCT__
but the on thing we absolut should not be do is launch anoth so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ prevent war __PUNCT__ with iran __PUNCT__
american and the world possess a power arsen of diplomat and econom option that have not yet been us __PUNCT__ let alon exhaust __PUNCT__
we need to us all those tool to forc presid ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ the ayatollah khameini __PUNCT__ and the mullah to understand that their nuclear ambit and their support of terror will put the iran on a fast track to utter isol __PUNCT__
we alreadi know diplomaci can work with even the toughest foe __PUNCT__
the few foreign polici success of the bush administr have come through the diplomaci it derid __PUNCT__
both north korea and libya have given up their struggl for weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
while we need to keep the pressur on to make sure these countri keep their promis __PUNCT__ the progress so far show what can be accomplish in iran __PUNCT__
we need to increas the divis between extremist and the iranian popul __PUNCT__
ahmadinejad is alreadi unpopular in hi countri and ha fail to meet hi promis to reduc corrupt and improv the economi __PUNCT__
thi is a countri that readi for chang __PUNCT__
women in tehran todai put on cloth thei want to wear under the burkha and veil thei ar forc to wear __PUNCT__
iranian everywher share a hunger for idea and free express __PUNCT__ seen in iran thrive black market in great literatur __PUNCT__ new classic __PUNCT__ and even western video __PUNCT__
and it is iranian like mani of you in thi room __PUNCT__ young peopl __PUNCT__ student __PUNCT__ who ar lead the charg to undermin the stifl oppress of ahmadinejad __PUNCT__
we need to let the peopl of iran know that ahmadinejad extrem and pursuit of nuclear weapon will onli hurt them and destroi their countri prospect for advanc __PUNCT__
we need __PUNCT__ in short __PUNCT__ a new strategi for iran __PUNCT__
my plan for iran ha five principl __PUNCT__
first and foremost __PUNCT__ we need to ensur that the prevent war doctrin goe where it belong __PUNCT__ the trash __PUNCT__ heap of histori __PUNCT__
as he ha done with so much els __PUNCT__ vice presid al gore got it right about the prevent war doctrin __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the same year that georg bush introduc hi prevent war doctrin __PUNCT__ gore made a speech at the commonwealth club in california __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ what thi doctrin doe is to destroi the goal of a world in which state consid themselv subject to law __PUNCT__ particularli in the matter of standard for the us of violenc against each other __PUNCT__
that concept would be displac by the notion that there is no law but the discret of the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
these ar especi chill word to read five year later __PUNCT__ after iraq __PUNCT__ guantanamo bai __PUNCT__ and the presid refus to condemn tortur __PUNCT__ and thei ar particularli relev to the situat with iran __PUNCT__
i believ everi candid ow it to the american peopl to be veri clear about where he or she stand on thi question __PUNCT__
as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ my nation secur polici will be base on deterr strength and alwai protect american __PUNCT__ in short __PUNCT__ the us of forc as a last resort __PUNCT__
as a part of thi strategi __PUNCT__ i will ask my nation secur advisor to remov presid bush explicit endors of a prevent war doctrin from my nation secur strategi __PUNCT__
and i will ask our joint chief of staff to form militari plan in accord with proven nation secur strategi that we know can keep us and our alli safe __PUNCT__ not discredit and danger ideolog fanci __PUNCT__
thi strategi will keep america and our alli safe __PUNCT__ while show the world we ar onc again a strong countri that can alwai win war __PUNCT__ but that prefer peac over war __PUNCT__
most importantli __PUNCT__ it will restor our legitimaci in the ey of the world __PUNCT__
everyon know we power __PUNCT__
the question is what we us our power for __PUNCT__ and whether the rest of the world will onc again see us as a forc for good __PUNCT__ rather than the bulli we becom under bush __PUNCT__
the second principl is to us bolder and more target econom sanction to forc iran leader to understand that thei cannot continu to buck the will of the intern commun without destroi their abil to be the modern __PUNCT__ advanc nation thei so desper want to becom __PUNCT__
there ar smart sanction that will achiev result __PUNCT__ and there ar reckless sanction that will backfir and plai into a polici of militari attack __PUNCT__
the bush __PUNCT__ chenei sanction senat clinton support ar the most radic __PUNCT__ unpreced __PUNCT__ and belliger sanction possibl __PUNCT__
these reckless sanction will escal tension between the u. __PUNCT__ and iran __PUNCT__ the thing bush and chenei most want __PUNCT__ and have other unintend consequ __PUNCT__ such as higher oil price __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we should pursu smarter sanction that will forc iran leader to realiz that their pursuit of nuclear weapon will shut down their economi __PUNCT__ further isol them from the world commun __PUNCT__ and make them a rogu nation for gener __PUNCT__
we must fulli enforc the iran sanction act __PUNCT__ a law congress pass to let the presid punish compani who do busi with iran extremist regim __PUNCT__
we must work multilater __PUNCT__ most importantli __PUNCT__ with our western european alli __PUNCT__ to strengthen econom sanction on iran __PUNCT__
and we should shut down iranian access to the american financi system __PUNCT__
the bush administr recent ban two iranian bank from access our system __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ iranian can still do busi through third parti and through other bank __PUNCT__
thi must stop __PUNCT__
the third principl of my plan is to us __PUNCT__ carrot __PUNCT__ diplomat measur to convinc iran to abandon it nuclear ambit and re __PUNCT__ join the world commun __PUNCT__
we should draw iran into complianc through incent includ increas refineri capac and a region fuel bank that iran could us for peac purpos __PUNCT__
and we need to us the possibl of bring iran into multilater econom organ __PUNCT__ includ the wto __PUNCT__ as a carrot for chang __PUNCT__
the fourth principl of my polici is to reengag with iran __PUNCT__
even republican like senat hagel ar now urg the presid to open up commun with iran __PUNCT__
commun is not a concess __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ we talk to our great enemi __PUNCT__ the soviet union __PUNCT__ at the height of tension dure the cold war __PUNCT__
we should begin build a new cours of diplomat relat with iran by expand low __PUNCT__ level talk between govern offici on both side in a neutral countri __PUNCT__
the goal of these talk should be to find a path out of the log __PUNCT__ jam creat by the bush administr and __PUNCT__ ultim __PUNCT__ to achiev full diplomat relat between the two countri __PUNCT__
but we must alwai negoti from a posit of strength __PUNCT__
unlik presid bush __PUNCT__ i believ we do need to meet with iran __PUNCT__
but ani higher __PUNCT__ level meet should onli happen if we verifi that the meet would promot america nation secur interest and would not be us for propaganda or other improp purpos __PUNCT__
and the fifth and final principl is to reengag with other major nation on the challeng of iran __PUNCT__
we must work with china and russia on the problem of iran nuclear ambit __PUNCT__
both nation have econom relationship with iran on trade and energi __PUNCT__
but both nation also have a strong interest in stabil in the middl east __PUNCT__
and neither nation want the nuclear club to expand __PUNCT__
in the first year of my administr __PUNCT__ i will conven a confer with my secretari of state and repres from the __PUNCT__ e.u __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ great britain __PUNCT__ franc __PUNCT__ and germani __PUNCT__ russia __PUNCT__ china and iran __PUNCT__ to discuss a wai out of the stalem of the bush administr __PUNCT__
the strategi i describ to you todai is the right wai to keep america strong while keep the peac __PUNCT__
it is the right wai to forc iran to forgo it nuclear ambit __PUNCT__
and it is the right wai to restor america histor role as a leader of the world commun __PUNCT__ through a combin of strength __PUNCT__ vision __PUNCT__ and reengag with the world __PUNCT__
america need a presid who can guid america through a danger world __PUNCT__ with the wisdom of histori by our side __PUNCT__
america ha gone through similar challeng befor __PUNCT__
in hi first inaugur speech __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ franklin delano roosevelt reject the fail republican polici of militari intervent in latin america and europ __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he told the nation __PUNCT__ we should __PUNCT__ dedic thi nation to the polici of the good neighbor __PUNCT__
the neighbor who respect hi oblig and respect the sanctiti of hi agreement in and with a world of neighbor __PUNCT__
that the america we should be __PUNCT__
thi is the great vision of our great presid __PUNCT__
it is the vision of a nation of honor __PUNCT__
it is the vision of a nation of everydai hero __PUNCT__ like the brave men and women fight everi dai in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
and it is the vision that guid me as i seek to be your presid __PUNCT__
but i need your help __PUNCT__
we can onli rebuild america if we rebuild it togeth __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can restor our valu to washington __PUNCT__ and restor america moral author to the world __PUNCT__
thank you for be with me here todai __PUNCT__
god bless you and god bless america __PUNCT__
