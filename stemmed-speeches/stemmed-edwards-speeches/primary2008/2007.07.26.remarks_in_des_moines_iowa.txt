last week __PUNCT__ i travel nearli __NUM__ mile to shine a light on some of the great injustic inflict everi dai on million of our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
i met health care worker without health care __PUNCT__ entir neighborhood torn apart by predatori lend __PUNCT__ and a man who went __NUM__ year of hi life without be abl to speak becaus he couldn't afford a __MONEY__ surgeri __PUNCT__
thi wasn't dure the great depress __PUNCT__
thi wasn't in a foreign countri __PUNCT__
it wa here __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__
i carri these stori and thousand of other just like them everywher i go __PUNCT__
thei ar a constant remind of what i fight for and the challeng befor us __PUNCT__
thei part of a fundament unfair that is at the heart of our economi and our societi __PUNCT__
thi fundament unfair is also at the heart of the two america __PUNCT__ on for those on top __PUNCT__ the big corpor and a few veri fortun famili __PUNCT__ and on for everyon els __PUNCT__
we have on america that live by the paycheck calendar __PUNCT__ anoth that never ha to look at the calendar befor write a check __PUNCT__
on america that afraid it won't be abl to leav it children a better life __PUNCT__ anoth whose children ar alreadi set for life __PUNCT__
on america __PUNCT__ middl __PUNCT__ class america __PUNCT__ long forgotten by washington __PUNCT__ and anoth america __PUNCT__ narrow __PUNCT__ interest america __PUNCT__ whose everi wish is washington command __PUNCT__
if you don't think there ar two america __PUNCT__ let me share with you three fact __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ the typic ceo make more by the end of lunch than an averag wage worker make all year __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the incom gap is wider than at ani time sinc befor the depress __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ incom earner in america now make more than the bottom __NUM__ million combin __PUNCT__
and third __PUNCT__ in the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ the number of lobbyist in washington ha tripl to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that mean there ar sixti regist lobbyist for each member of congress and __NUM__ time more lobbyist than peopl in my hometown of robbin __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
that all you need to know to know that washington is the problem __PUNCT__ not the solut __PUNCT__
someth wrong when we have __NUM__ million american live in poverti and thi kind of incom dispar __PUNCT__
when __NUM__ million american can't get health care __PUNCT__ but corpor can get whatev thei want from congress __PUNCT__
that mai be georg bush america __PUNCT__ but that doesn't mean it right __PUNCT__
the crowd in charg now hasn't done anyth to fix thi __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ washington under georg bush and the republican ha gone out of their wai to make it wors __PUNCT__ deliber circl the wagon around success to ensur that those who have it get even more __PUNCT__ instead of creat opportun to give everyon an equal chanc __PUNCT__
but that doesn't mean it start when thei came into offic __PUNCT__
men in their 30 todai earn less in real dollar than their father did __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
for an entir gener __PUNCT__ regular worker haven't seen a rais __PUNCT__
with thi realiti stare them in the face __PUNCT__ it not surpris that less than a third of american now believ the next gener will be better off __PUNCT__
it time for us to put our economi back in line with our valu __PUNCT__
it time to end the presid war on work __PUNCT__
and it time to restor fair to a tax code that ha been driven badli out of whack by the wronghead rule of the washington establish __PUNCT__ more wealth for the wealthi and more power for the power __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ when the middl __PUNCT__ class make monei from hard work thei shouldn't pai higher tax than when the rich make monei from monei __PUNCT__
it time for us to fight back for the american dream that sai we have opportun for all and special privileg for none __PUNCT__
that success is base on how hard you work __PUNCT__ not how much influenc you have __PUNCT__
that a child futur doe not depend on hi or her parent __PUNCT__ wealth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ none of thi happen by accid __PUNCT__
washington is broken __PUNCT__
the system is rig __PUNCT__
cronyism and corpor interest prevail over fair and the best interest of the american peopl __PUNCT__
washington put wall street befor main street __PUNCT__
pharmaceut compani befor patient __PUNCT__
agricultur conglomer befor famili farmer __PUNCT__
if you want to think about all thi in a veri simpl wai __PUNCT__ it that washington valu wealth over work __PUNCT__
and it no surpris __PUNCT__ the peopl with wealth and corpor power ar the same peopl who keep politician in power __PUNCT__
thei scratch washington back and washington scratch their __PUNCT__
but it doesn't have to be thi wai __PUNCT__
i still believ passion in the american dream becaus i live it myself __PUNCT__
i came from a famili with veri littl __PUNCT__ my father had to borrow __MONEY__ to bring me home from the hospit __PUNCT__
now i want for no materi thing __PUNCT__
i know that we can fix the mess we ar in __PUNCT__
i know that we can replac two america with on america __PUNCT__
we can end these divis by recommit ourselv to a govern of __PUNCT__ by and for the peopl __PUNCT__ but it not go to be easi __PUNCT__
there ar power forc that will resist us __PUNCT__
these ar the same power forc i have fought against all my adult life __PUNCT__
but i have defeat them befor and we will defeat them togeth becaus no matter how power special interest america think it is __PUNCT__ there is no on more power than the american peopl and togeth we can build on america and restor the american dream we all believ in __PUNCT__
but let me tell you on thing __PUNCT__ it not go to be easi and it go to take all of us togeth __PUNCT__
becaus the peopl with power aren't go to give it up without a fight __PUNCT__
and we can't sit down with them and make a deal __PUNCT__
we can't triangul our wai to big chang __PUNCT__ we can't compromis our wai to big chang __PUNCT__ we need to lead the wai to big chang __PUNCT__
and that start with me be specif __PUNCT__ clear and honest about what i go to do __PUNCT__
fix the economi is a critic part of put our countri back on track __PUNCT__
we won't be abl to do thi by think small or take babi step __PUNCT__
we go to have to take giant step __PUNCT__
i want to talk to you about my plan to build an economi that reward all work and creat opportun for everi american __PUNCT__
to build and rebuild thi economi we need to __PUNCT__ reform our tax system to reward work instead of onli wealth __PUNCT__
negoti and enforc smarter trade agreement that benefit worker and consum __PUNCT__
demand corpor respons and ensur that corpor treat worker fairli __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ i go to focu on our tax code __PUNCT__ which is the wai we repres our valu as a nation in our economi __PUNCT__
our tax code ha shift most of the burden onto the back of work american __PUNCT__
there is simpli no end to the special tax break avail to big corpor and wealthi individu who can afford lawyer and lobbyist __PUNCT__
thi is all wrong __PUNCT__
it undermin our core valu of work and fair __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as we learn in the last nearli seven year __PUNCT__ it slow down our economi __PUNCT__
the great engin of growth in america isn't the special interest or the monei manag __PUNCT__ it is the teacher and factori worker and engin who quietli contribut everi dai __PUNCT__
i will rewrit our tax code to make sure it is fair and that hard __PUNCT__ work famili __PUNCT__ like those here in iowa __PUNCT__ can succe __PUNCT__ and so that america can succe __PUNCT__
thi mean that poor and middl class famili who work hard __PUNCT__ save __PUNCT__ and do right by their famili will pai less __PUNCT__
it also mean that those at the veri top __PUNCT__ who have benefit from special break after special break dure the bush administr __PUNCT__ will again pai their fair share __PUNCT__
first todai __PUNCT__ i go to talk about three new tax cut that will honor valu that make our countri great __PUNCT__ save __PUNCT__ work __PUNCT__ and famili __PUNCT__
start off __PUNCT__ we need to encourag famili to build asset __PUNCT__ so that thei each have a nest egg to bui a home __PUNCT__ send their kid to colleg __PUNCT__ and retir with digniti __PUNCT__
yet becaus our tax code give the biggest save break to the peopl at the top __PUNCT__ most famili todai don't have the necessari incent to save __PUNCT__
i go to turn that around __PUNCT__
i will help million of american famili build a better life by provid each of them a dollar __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__ dollar match on up to __MONEY__ a year of their save __PUNCT__
we call them get ahead account __PUNCT__ and thei give million of famili the chanc to do just that __PUNCT__
in my case __PUNCT__ that chanc to go to colleg meant everyth __PUNCT__
no young person should be deni that chanc becaus of lack of monei __PUNCT__ and pile more and more loan onto student is not the answer __PUNCT__
that why i propos a nation __PUNCT__ colleg for everyon __PUNCT__ initi base on the program we start in a rural counti in north carolina __PUNCT__ which will help pai for the first year of colleg for ani student who agre to work part __PUNCT__ time and stai out of troubl __PUNCT__
in north carolina __PUNCT__ student who never thought thei would have the chanc to go to colleg ar now get readi to start thi fall __PUNCT__
to help famili save for colleg __PUNCT__ i also let famili deposit their child tax credit into colleg save account __PUNCT__
we ar also go to do more to honor work and work famili in our tax code __PUNCT__
i help low __PUNCT__ incom worker get ahead by creat work bond that match their save and by let everyon open a modest save account tax __PUNCT__ free __PUNCT__
we improv and expand our most import tax break for work famili __PUNCT__ the earn incom credit __PUNCT__ by cut the marriag penalti that still hit low __PUNCT__ incom famili and by stop singl worker from be tax deeper into poverti __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we will expand the child care tax credit so that it cover half of the averag child care cost __PUNCT__ and expand it to make it much more valuabl for million of work famili __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ these get ahead account __PUNCT__ work bond __PUNCT__ expand earn incom tax credit __PUNCT__ and expand child care credit will put america work poor and middl class back where thei belong __PUNCT__ at the heart of our prioriti __PUNCT__
while these four signific improv in the fundament fair of our individu tax system will clearli come at a cost to the treasuri __PUNCT__ i will pai for these benefit for the lower earn and middl class taxpay by close the loophol and abus which ar now benefit onli the wealthiest in our societi __PUNCT__
the place to start is unearn incom __PUNCT__ capit gain and dividend __PUNCT__
studi after studi ha shown that low capit gain rate appli to the wealth of the wealthiest don't add anyth to our economi __PUNCT__
thei just add to our deficit and take awai resourc we veri much need elsewher __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will repeal the bush tax cut for famili earn more than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
i will also rais the top capit gain rate to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ while protect the save and invest of regular famili __PUNCT__
a __NUM__ percent capit gain tax rate will help make sure that the wealthiest of american pai their fair share of tax __PUNCT__
if we truli believ in a tax code that valu work instead of wealth __PUNCT__ then we cannot complet elimin the estat tax __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will elimin estat tax for the middl class __PUNCT__ for small busi owner __PUNCT__ and for famili farmer __PUNCT__ but i will keep these tax on the few hundr thousand extrem wealthi famili with veri larg estat abov __MONEY__ million in valu __PUNCT__
if we want a truli fair tax system __PUNCT__ then we also have to end the injustic in our system that allow mani wealthi peopl and corpor to avoid tax altogeth __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will declar war on offshor tax haven __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we need to end the special break for insid __PUNCT__
the wealthi shouldn't be given hand out while work peopl struggl to get a leg up __PUNCT__
we need to close loophol like the on that let hedg fund and privat equiti manag treat most of their incom as capit gain __PUNCT__
these sever action __PUNCT__ when taken togeth __PUNCT__ will better respect the worker of america __PUNCT__ restor fundament tax fair __PUNCT__ and bring opportun and advantag to everyon across america __PUNCT__ includ here in iowa __PUNCT__
the higher capit gain rate on the highest incom bracket will pai for the new tax benefit i propos todai __PUNCT__
all of the step i have propos will rais well over __MONEY__ billion a year to be reinvest in health care __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and other critic prioriti __PUNCT__
invest in american and in america unleash the potenti of gener and made thi countri great __PUNCT__ but we lost our wai when we sacrif our nation to the privat wealth accumul of a few __PUNCT__
it time to stop promot the wealth of the wealthi and to start make sure that everi american who work hard ha the chanc to move up the econom ladder __PUNCT__
with these step __PUNCT__ our tax code will be fairer and our economi stronger __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ we talk about how we need to chang out tax code __PUNCT__ and in the come dai __PUNCT__ i be talk about trade and corpor respons __PUNCT__
let me just sai a word about each todai __PUNCT__

i seen the effect of bad trade deal up close __PUNCT__
i saw what happen when the mill that my dad work in all hi life __PUNCT__ and that i work in myself when i wa young __PUNCT__ close and the job move awai __PUNCT__
when thi happen __PUNCT__ it wa not just devast to our commun econom __PUNCT__
those weren't just job that move awai __PUNCT__
it wa devast to the pride and digniti of the peopl who work hard everi dai try to make a better life for their kid __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ it a stori that is still happen all over america __PUNCT__
the labor of the american peopl ha made our countri great and we need to honor that labor in our trade polici __PUNCT__
i will soon be outlin detail about how we can do that __PUNCT__
job aren't the onli thing we lost in thi gener __PUNCT__
a gener ago __PUNCT__ corpor america gener view their respons as be equal split among their sharehold __PUNCT__ employe __PUNCT__ commun and the nation __PUNCT__
compani that had a strong sens of oblig to the countri gave american worker the tool to out produc the rest of the world __PUNCT__
compani prosper and so did our worker and the economi __PUNCT__
soon __PUNCT__ i also be talk about specif thing we can do to get corpor back in line with our valu __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ how we structur our tax code and how we treat our worker sai everyth about the kind of societi we ar __PUNCT__

washington think the american peopl don't care about the two america __PUNCT__
is thi true __PUNCT__ do we care __PUNCT__ the american peopl care __PUNCT__
i know thei care __PUNCT__
as i travel the countri __PUNCT__ i seen that thei care __PUNCT__
if we want to live in a moral and just and fair america __PUNCT__ an america where everyon is equal __PUNCT__ an america where everyon pai their fair share __PUNCT__ an america that valu hard work __PUNCT__ if we want to live in thi america __PUNCT__ then i need you __PUNCT__
i have decid what i go to do with the rest of my life __PUNCT__
i go to fight everi dai for the million of american whose voic ar ignor by washington __PUNCT__
