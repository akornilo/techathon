peopl __PUNCT__ peopl have ask me __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what is __PUNCT__ what is the secret __PUNCT__ why ar you do so well __PUNCT__ is it your job messag __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we have a great job messag __PUNCT__ talk about everywher we go and particularli here in the industri heartland of missouri __PUNCT__ where thei still make thing here in missouri __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__
it a messag of __PUNCT__ as the wall street journal call our econom plan __PUNCT__ suppli __PUNCT__ side econom for the work man __PUNCT__ is reson in minnesota and here in missouri and across thi countri __PUNCT__
and you see that __PUNCT__ when you have a republican out there talk about growth __PUNCT__ talk about growth for everybodi __PUNCT__ __URL__ american respond __PUNCT__ becaus i do care about not __NUM__ percent or __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
i care about the veri rich and the veri poor __PUNCT__
i care about __NUM__ percent of america __PUNCT__
the real messag __PUNCT__ the messag that we been take across thi countri and here in missouri is a messag of what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
thi is the most import elect in your lifetim __PUNCT__
thi is an elect __PUNCT__ we seen it so evid just here in the last week __PUNCT__
thi is an elect fundament about the kind of countri you go to hand off to your children and grandchildren __PUNCT__ whether thei ar go to have the level of freedom and opportun that you have __PUNCT__
and we have a presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ as i mention __PUNCT__ who someon who believ he know better __PUNCT__ that we need to accumul more power in washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ for the elit in our countri __PUNCT__ to be abl to govern you becaus you ar incap of liberti __PUNCT__ that you ar incap of freedom __PUNCT__
that what thi presid believ __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ and american understand that there is a great __PUNCT__ great deal at stake __PUNCT__
if thi presid is re __PUNCT__ elect and if we don't have a nomine that can make thi case and not be compromis on the biggest issu of the dai __PUNCT__ but can make the case to the american public that thi is about the founder freedom __PUNCT__ thi is about a countri that believ in god __PUNCT__ given right __PUNCT__ and a constitut that is limit to protect those right __PUNCT__
the presid doe not believ that __PUNCT__
the presid over the last few year ha tri to tell you that he __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the govern can give you right __PUNCT__ the govern can take care of you and provid for you __PUNCT__
thei can give you the right to health care __PUNCT__ like in obamacar __PUNCT__
but look what happen when the govern give you right __PUNCT__
when the govern give you right __PUNCT__ unlik when god give you right __PUNCT__ the govern can take them awai __PUNCT__
when govern give you right __PUNCT__ the govern can tell you how to exercis those right __PUNCT__
and we saw that just in the last week __PUNCT__ with a group of peopl __PUNCT__ a small group of peopl __PUNCT__ just cathol in the unit state of america who were told you have a right to health care __PUNCT__ but you will have the health care that we tell you __PUNCT__ you have to give your peopl __PUNCT__ whether it is against the teach of your church or not __PUNCT__
i never thought as a first __PUNCT__ gener american __PUNCT__ whose parent and grandpar love freedom and came here becaus thei didn't want the govern tell them what to believ and how to believ it __PUNCT__ that we had a first amend that actual stood for freedom of conscienc __PUNCT__ that we have a presid of the unit state who would roll over that and impos hi secular valu on the peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__
and it wors than that __PUNCT__
when on of the cathol bishop tri to commun that through armi chaplain __PUNCT__ the obama administr said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ you can't do that __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ becaus your languag is sediti __PUNCT__ and thei made them chang the languag of a letter from a bishop to hi peopl __PUNCT__
ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ freedom is at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
we need to be the voic for freedom __PUNCT__
and that found document __PUNCT__ the declar of independ __PUNCT__ at the end of that document __PUNCT__ those founder sign their name __PUNCT__
but the last claus of that document said we pledg our live __PUNCT__ our fortun __PUNCT__ and our sacr honor __PUNCT__
ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ everi gener of american doesn't creat freedom __PUNCT__ but thei have __PUNCT__ in mani respect __PUNCT__ a harder job __PUNCT__
