thi campaign is go to be about a vision __PUNCT__

well __PUNCT__ there ar those in our countri and those in the oval offic who believ that not the case __PUNCT__
thei believ that right do in fact come from the govern and that thei have gone around convinc the american public that thei can in fact give you right __PUNCT__
the most import on that thei been abl to shove down the throat of the american public wa __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the right to health care __PUNCT__
the right to health care in obamacar __PUNCT__
and we see what happen when govern give you right __PUNCT__
when govern give you right __PUNCT__ govern can take awai those right __PUNCT__
when govern give you right __PUNCT__ govern can coerc you into do thing in exercis the right that thei gave you __PUNCT__
i been travel around thi countri talk about how obamacar will crush econom freedom __PUNCT__
will make peopl depend upon govern for the most import thing __PUNCT__ their veri live __PUNCT__
and as a result __PUNCT__ govern will own you __PUNCT__
becaus you will have to pai tribut to washington in order to get the care you need for your children __PUNCT__
on of the reason i in thi race __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ a major reason i in thi race is becaus i think obamacar is a game changer for america __PUNCT__
margaret thatcher said when she left the prime ministership of england __PUNCT__ she wa never abl to accomplish what reagan accomplish __PUNCT__
she said the reason __PUNCT__ the british nation health care system __PUNCT__
onc peopl have that depend __PUNCT__ thei ar never realli ever free again __PUNCT__
ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ we seen thi plai out on the stage in the last few week __PUNCT__
we seen the presid of the unit state not onli tell you what insur coverag you should have __PUNCT__ how much you go to pai __PUNCT__ how much you be fine if you don't __PUNCT__
but he now tell the cathol church that thei ar forc to pai for thing that ar against their basic tenet and teach __PUNCT__ against their first amend right __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ interest enough __PUNCT__ here what thei forc them to do __PUNCT__
in an insur polici __PUNCT__ thei forc them to pai for someth that cost just a few dollar __PUNCT__
is that what insur is for __PUNCT__ the foundat idea that we have the govern tell you that you have to pai for everyth as a busi __PUNCT__
thing that ar r not realli thing that you need insur for __PUNCT__
and still forc on someth that is not a critic econom need __PUNCT__
when you have an econom distress with which you would need insur __PUNCT__ but forc them even the more to do it for minor expens __PUNCT__
ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ thi is the kind of coercion that we can expect __PUNCT__
it not about contracept __PUNCT__
it about econom liberti __PUNCT__
it about freedom of speech __PUNCT__
it about freedom of religion __PUNCT__
it about govern control of your live and it got to stop __PUNCT__
and thi isn't the onli place that presid obama tri to control your live __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ on of the favorit thing of the left is to us your sentiment __PUNCT__ your proper understand and belief that we ar steward of thi earth __PUNCT__
and that we have respons to hand off a beauti earth to the next gener __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ thei us that and thei us it in the past to try to scare you into support radic idea on the environ __PUNCT__
thei tri it with thi idea __PUNCT__ thi politic of scienc call man __PUNCT__ made global warm and presid obama you mai rememb __PUNCT__ tri to pass cap and trade and tri to get control __PUNCT__ not onli of the health care system __PUNCT__ but of the energi industri __PUNCT__ the manufactur industri __PUNCT__ anoth two big sector of thi economi __PUNCT__
and us thi facad of man __PUNCT__ made global warm __PUNCT__
i stood up and fought against those thing __PUNCT__
why __PUNCT__ becaus thei will destroi the veri foundat of prosper in our countri __PUNCT__
you look at ani countri in the world and you look at their energi consumpt __PUNCT__ the cost of energi and their qualiti of life __PUNCT__ their standard of live __PUNCT__
the more energi consumpt __PUNCT__ the higher the standard of live __PUNCT__
that just the bottom line __PUNCT__
we need an america if we go to fuel a great and vibrant economi __PUNCT__ we need afford energi __PUNCT__
and thi administr ha gone out and not onli ha attack us with cap and trade __PUNCT__ and global warm __PUNCT__ but now that that ha been thrown on the dust bin of histori __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ thei go after hydro frack __PUNCT__
i come from pennsylvania __PUNCT__
we do a littl bit of that in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ thank god __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ of cours now that we do hydro frack near the popul center __PUNCT__ the bogeyman come out __PUNCT__
look at what it go to do to you __PUNCT__
you know how mani well have been hydro frack in the unit state __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ or __NUM__ __PUNCT__
where been all the nois __PUNCT__ ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ thei scare you to intimid you to trust them and to give them more power __PUNCT__
we need someon who will to go out on these big issu of the dai and draw contrast __PUNCT__
we not go to win thi elect __PUNCT__ ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ becaus the republican candid ha the most monei to beat up their oppon and win the elect __PUNCT__
we not go to win thi elect with over a lopsid monei advantag __PUNCT__
we won't have on in the fall __PUNCT__
presid obama will have more monei whoever our nomine is __PUNCT__
so just think about what it go to take __PUNCT__
it go to take idea __PUNCT__ vision __PUNCT__ contrast __PUNCT__ a record of accomplish that can go up against the fail polici of barack obama __PUNCT__
that the winner __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let just take a look at that in the republican field __PUNCT__
who ha the boldest contrast __PUNCT__ who ha the record that thei can run on __PUNCT__ who ha the bold plan to turn thi economi around __PUNCT__ and to support the veri institut of our countri that provid the foundat of our countri __PUNCT__ faith and famili __PUNCT__ who ha that strong track record and that contrast __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__
i guess i can quit now sinc you all convinc of that __PUNCT__ but let look at it __PUNCT__
on the issu of obamacar __PUNCT__ who ha a record of support health save account and tort reform and bottom up consum __PUNCT__ driven health care for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and who ha support __PUNCT__ in fact the stepchild of obamacar __PUNCT__ the person in massachusett who built the largest govern __PUNCT__ run health care system in the unit state __PUNCT__
someon who would simpli give that issu awai in the fall __PUNCT__
give the issu awai of govern control of your health __PUNCT__
who would be the better person to go after the obama administr on try to control the energi and the manufactur sector of our economi try to dictat to you what light to turn on and what car to drive __PUNCT__ would it be someon that bought into man __PUNCT__ made global warm and impos the first carbon cap in the state of massachusett __PUNCT__ the first state to do so in the countri __PUNCT__ would it be someon who would take on the other big issu of govern control of our economi __PUNCT__ which is the govern control of the financi servic sector __PUNCT__ we see a lot of __PUNCT__ we see everybodi up on stage at the debat complain about dodd __PUNCT__ frank __PUNCT__
but two of the three candid support the wall street bailout __PUNCT__ which wa the predecessor of which dodd __PUNCT__ frank wa base on __PUNCT__
so who would provid the clear contrast of believ in the conserv vision __PUNCT__ of bottom up __PUNCT__ free peopl __PUNCT__ free market __PUNCT__
not govern depend __PUNCT__ govern control __PUNCT__
ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ we not go to win with monei __PUNCT__ we go to win with contrast __PUNCT__
we go to win with idea __PUNCT__
we go to win by make barack obama and hi fail polici the issu in thi race __PUNCT__
we won in __NUM__ becaus conserv ralli __PUNCT__
thei were excit about the contrast __PUNCT__
thei were excit about the candid who were put forth in that elect __PUNCT__
that why we won __PUNCT__
we alwai talk about how ar we go to get the moder __PUNCT__ why would an undecid voter vote for a candid of a parti who the parti not excit about __PUNCT__ we need conserv now to ralli for a conserv to go into __DATE__ to excit the conserv base __PUNCT__
to pull with that excit moder voter and to defeat barack obama in the fall __PUNCT__
i close __PUNCT__ i just sai thi __PUNCT__
when i restart our speech __PUNCT__ i refer to where our right came from __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ that in our declar of independ __PUNCT__
i know a lot of folk like to focu on the constitut __PUNCT__
the constitut is obvious the oper manual for america __PUNCT__
it is the how of america and it essenti that we return our govern to the constraint of that constitut __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ the why of america __PUNCT__ who we ar __PUNCT__ is in the declar __PUNCT__
and these word __PUNCT__ we hold these truth to be self __PUNCT__ evid that all american ar creat equal and endow by their creator with certain inalien right __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
a countri that wa built on the idea that right come to us from god and that the govern job __PUNCT__ the on thing the govern job is to do is to protect those right so you can form famili and church and commun organ __PUNCT__ civic group __PUNCT__ hospit __PUNCT__ school and build a great and just societi from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that the conserv vision for america __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
