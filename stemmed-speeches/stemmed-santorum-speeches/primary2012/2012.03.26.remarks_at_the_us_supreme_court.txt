with it big govern mandat __PUNCT__ obamacar is noth short of a direct assault on our constitut __PUNCT__ and an insult to everi freedom love american __PUNCT__
and if it is not overturn or repeal __PUNCT__ it will have fundament chang our countri forev __PUNCT__ and will lead to even more eros of the basic freedom and right we have cherish sinc the birth of our nation __PUNCT__
that is why i protest and that is why i have made full repeal of obamacar a kei agenda item for my campaign for presid __PUNCT__

let me finish by sai the most tragic part of all is that a member of our own parti __PUNCT__ mitt romnei __PUNCT__ is consid the architect of obamacar __PUNCT__
