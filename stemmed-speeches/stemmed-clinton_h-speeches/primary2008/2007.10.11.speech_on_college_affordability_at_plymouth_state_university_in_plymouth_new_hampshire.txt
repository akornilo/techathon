we go to have a convers todai and we go to start by talk about an issu that might be of particular interest to all of you and your famili and that is colleg afford __PUNCT__
how we can do more to make colleg afford for hardwork young peopl and their famili __PUNCT__
i have a coupl of peopl with me who you will meet in a minut who ar go to realli illustr some of the challeng that student and famili here in nh and across the countri face when it come to afford colleg __PUNCT__
ill be introduc them in a few minut __PUNCT__
but i thank them for be part of thi discuss __PUNCT__
after we finish talk about colleg afford we go to throw it open for you to ask ani question you ar interest in becaus i know how import thi elect is for the futur and in fact it is probabl more import for the futur of the student here than for the rest of us becaus the next presid will make decis to chart the cours of our countri through much of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
now i obvious believ that among the task of the next presid will be revers the damag that ha been done by our current presid __PUNCT__
we won't be move forward with confid and compet into the futur __PUNCT__ tackl the challeng we face __PUNCT__ understand that there is no guarante and we will remain a great nation with a grow economi and share prosper and the opportun avail that were present for previou gener unless we do the work that is necessari to make that happen __PUNCT__
and on of the kei to a strong and confid america is a system of higher educ that is accept to all who ar motiv to seek it out __PUNCT__
and yet as i travel across our countri __PUNCT__ i have confirm everi dai about how much more difficult it is for mani student to afford to start colleg __PUNCT__ continu colleg and graduat from colleg than it wa __NUM__ or __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
but i like to start off with a few question __PUNCT__
how mani of you have ever worri about whether you could afford colleg or if your famili member whether the young peopl in your famili could afford colleg __PUNCT__ how mani of you have ever had to worri about that __PUNCT__
that a lot of hand __PUNCT__
how mani of you have taken out colleg loan __PUNCT__
how mani of you ar total baffl by the colleg loan format __PUNCT__ how mani of you have ever wonder how we go to pai back those loan __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we don't exactli make it easi for you __PUNCT__ do we __PUNCT__ colleg cost ar up __NUM__ percent in the last five year alon __PUNCT__
the averag student graduat with __MONEY__ in debt __PUNCT__
that number is even higher in new hampshir __PUNCT__
new hampshir ha on of the highest cost of colleg in the countri __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ student graduat with higher debt __PUNCT__
higher educ ha never been more of a financi burden __PUNCT__ but in todai global economi it never been more import __PUNCT__
graduat from four __PUNCT__ year colleg earn nearli twice as much as high school graduat __PUNCT__ an estim __MONEY__ million more over a lifetim __PUNCT__
forti __PUNCT__ two percent of all new job thi decad will requir some post __PUNCT__ secondari educ __PUNCT__
that a big jump from even six and a half year ago __PUNCT__ when it wa onli about __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
countri across the world __PUNCT__ from japan to south korea __PUNCT__ from canada to ireland __PUNCT__ ar educ their young peopl at higher rate than we ar in america __PUNCT__
that is new __PUNCT__
our higher educ system ha histor been the envi of the world __PUNCT__
we know that in other countri __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ the futur wa determin at the ag of __NUM__ or __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but thei have chang __PUNCT__ and thei now valu colleg much more __PUNCT__ and the rate of young peopl go to colleg ar actual higher than we have now in america __PUNCT__
and china and india ar not far behind __PUNCT__
when it come to higher educ __PUNCT__ we should not be plai catch __PUNCT__ up with the world __PUNCT__ we should continu to be lead __PUNCT__ becaus the skill and knowledg of our workforc will determin whether america can compet and win in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
american work harder than anybodi in the world __PUNCT__
when you measur product __PUNCT__ which is a term for determin how much output we get per hour __PUNCT__ per worker __PUNCT__ american ar by far the hardest __PUNCT__ work peopl __PUNCT__
but there is a mismatch between what american ar be compens for in term of all that hard work and whether our skill ar keep up with the new job challeng that await us __PUNCT__
thi is at the heart of what i been talk about thi week __PUNCT__
how can we rebuild the road to a strong and prosper middl class in america __PUNCT__ after what thi administr ha done the last six and a half year __PUNCT__ it will not be an easi task __PUNCT__
i believ we need a new begin __PUNCT__ so i been outlin how i would chang cours __PUNCT__ how i would chang cours in educ __PUNCT__ how i would chang cours in the economi __PUNCT__ how i would chang cours in heath care __PUNCT__ how i would chang cours in iraq and our polici around the world __PUNCT__
i start talk about an econom blueprint for a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
we got to creat more job __PUNCT__
i think we can do that if we had a seriou set of polici to address energi independ and global warm __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i believ that we can creat job if we end the war on scienc and begin to respect scientist and research __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i believ we can creat job if we invest in our infrastructur __PUNCT__ our road __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ our public transit __PUNCT__ and our virtual infrastructur __PUNCT__ which is why i appreci deb talk about my connect america plan __PUNCT__
we ar fall behind in access to high __PUNCT__ speed internet __PUNCT__
we us to lead the world __PUNCT__
now other countri have made invest __PUNCT__
thei move more quickli on the inform superhighwai __PUNCT__
we also have to restor fair to our economi __PUNCT__
we have more inequ than we had sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
the rich ar go so much richer __PUNCT__ the middl class is run in place __PUNCT__ and peopl ar fall back into poverti __PUNCT__
contrast that with what we did dure the __PUNCT__ 90 __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million new job and more peopl lift out of poverti that in ani time in our countri histori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i believ we can get back that level of __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ if we put our fiscal hous in order __PUNCT__ get back to where we were six and a half year ago with a balanc budget and a surplu __PUNCT__ start pai as we go again __PUNCT__ instead of borrow billion of dollar everi singl week from countri like china __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ south korea __PUNCT__ the gulf state __PUNCT__
and we even now ow monei to mexico __PUNCT__
so i think we should get back to fiscal respons __PUNCT__ becaus you begin as a nation to lose control over your destini when you ow monei to countri whose interest ar not the same as your own __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ i want to get back to the basic __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ that i wa rais on __PUNCT__
if you work hard and you respons __PUNCT__ then you and your famili can get ahead __PUNCT__
it pretti simpl and it work __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ tuesdai __PUNCT__ i outlin how i want to help more american save for retir __PUNCT__
we go to preserv and protect social secur and then we go to give american a chang to make invest so that thei can build up their own retir fund __PUNCT__
and yesterdai i talk about innov __PUNCT__ and i went to an innov compani right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ gt solar __PUNCT__ which should be the model for what we do around the countri __PUNCT__
thei actual export technolog to china __PUNCT__
don't you think that what we ought to be do instead of the other wai around __PUNCT__ and we can if we have the right polici again __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ todai i want to talk about how we open the gatewai to the middl class by make colleg afford and access __PUNCT__
back when i went to colleg my late father said to me that he save enough monei __PUNCT__ he wa a small __PUNCT__ busi man __PUNCT__ to pai for room __PUNCT__ board and tuition __PUNCT__ but i want to bui a book or anyth els __PUNCT__ i had to earn the monei __PUNCT__
that wa our deal __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ that wa fine with me __PUNCT__
then i graduat from colleg and i decid i want to go to law school __PUNCT__
so i told my father __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ that not part of the deal __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so i had to get a littl scholarship __PUNCT__ and i had to keep work __PUNCT__
but then i borrow monei __PUNCT__
and i borrow monei from the feder govern __PUNCT__
i borrow it __PUNCT__ as i recal __PUNCT__ at someth like __NUM__ percent interest __PUNCT__
it did not bankrupt me __PUNCT__
it did not caus me to have to take a job on wall street __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ i got to do what i want to do __PUNCT__
as a young lawyer __PUNCT__ i want to work at the children defens fund to defend the right and need of children __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ what is happen is so mani young peopl come out with debt and have to take job sole for the purpos of pai off their student loan __PUNCT__
i think we got to get back to the great american tradit of make it possibl for you to go to colleg __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ harri truman had the g.i __PUNCT__
bill __PUNCT__ that led to a thrive middl class __PUNCT__
presid eisenhow start loan for math and scienc educ __PUNCT__
he adopt pell grant and the hope scholarship __PUNCT__
and we have all understood __PUNCT__ for a long time __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ colleg educ is not the __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ for all of us __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ our current presid ha a differ approach __PUNCT__ more focus on provid handout to halliburton and tax cut to oil compani than he is to make sure that we take care of get the next gener educ __PUNCT__
so i go to revers that __PUNCT__ becaus too mani peopl todai feel like thei just invis when it come to afford colleg __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ if your parent work as hard he know how and you still haven't save enough monei __PUNCT__ then you ar invis to thi presid __PUNCT__

and if you a recent graduat who want to mayb be a nurs or a teacher or a polic offic or a social worker __PUNCT__ and then you look at your student loan and you figur out you can't pai them off if you be what your heart want to be __PUNCT__ you invis as well __PUNCT__

in the senat __PUNCT__ i sponsor a student borrow bill of right to ensur that student __PUNCT__ monthli payment would not exce a certain percentag of their incom and that the interest rate would be fair and not unpredict __PUNCT__
i proud that the new bill that the democrat major just pass and wa sign into law provid an incom __PUNCT__ base loan repay program like i had in law school and base on what i champion in the senat __PUNCT__

so it wa kind of a struggl for us watch him have to go into the air forc and wonder what might happen becaus of the war and thing like that __PUNCT__
so we were kind of nervou __PUNCT__ but glad that he went to school and we glad that he do what he do __PUNCT__
my other brother chri went to a tech school and i veri proud of him __PUNCT__ and my brother matt is actual go to school todai at a technic colleg in laconia and try to get an educ but it still hard for us to afford it __PUNCT__
and so i been do differ program try to learn how to afford it __PUNCT__
but there ar some thing as a high school student that i not realli awar of __PUNCT__ like the pell grant __PUNCT__ which you mention __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i never heard of it and i sure that other student in my school haven't and other student around new hampshir and the unit state haven't heard of differ program and scholarship that student can get to afford school __PUNCT__
so i realli interest in how to pai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ that the right question to ask __PUNCT__
kim __PUNCT__ do you want to add someth __PUNCT__ kim beauregard __PUNCT__ there a student educ talent search for famili that ar financi stabl but might not have the monei to pai __NUM__ dollar for school __PUNCT__ and thei brought us around to the differ colleg in new hampshir __PUNCT__ plymouth state wa on of them __PUNCT__
and i learn a lot about the differ colleg but thei never show us how to pai __PUNCT__
and we didn't know of ani of the option that would be open to her and some kind of scholarship definit would help her __PUNCT__
but we would take out a home equiti loan on our hous __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ you would consid take out a home equiti loan __PUNCT__ kim beauregard __PUNCT__ we would sell the hous if we have to __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ you would sell you own hous __PUNCT__ kim beauregard __PUNCT__ if we have to __PUNCT__ to pai for colleg for her __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well kim as a mom myself i have to sai i realli move by that __PUNCT__
what kim said it that not onli would thei take out a home equiti loan to pai for ashlei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ but thei would sell their hous if it were necessari __PUNCT__
becaus she is their youngest and she alwai dream of thi __PUNCT__
and like most mother kim want to do whatev it take to help ashlei live up to her dream __PUNCT__
i just don't think that a hard work famili like your should be put in that posit __PUNCT__
and that what we go to try to fix __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ kim beauregard __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ the thing you said todai realli give me a lot of hope __PUNCT__
and all of your __PUNCT__ not just todai __PUNCT__ but you health care plan and all your other propos ar wonder and i just like to thank you __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i think that it would realli be in america interest if ashlei could pursu her dream __PUNCT__
she a motiv __PUNCT__ obvious ambiti young woman who done well __PUNCT__
and i think the point you made about how thi inform is so hard to gather is definit someth to address __PUNCT__
now with the internet all we need is a simpl websit where everybodi can go __PUNCT__
that wai you can go to on place __PUNCT__ put in the name of ani colleg your consid and you could see what the cost ar __PUNCT__ you can see what the offer ar __PUNCT__ you can see what you elig for __PUNCT__
becaus these ar huge decis __PUNCT__ especi for a famili like the beauregard who a will to make such a drastic decis of mayb sell their home __PUNCT__
we need to get number on __PUNCT__ the best inform possibl __PUNCT__ number two we need to get more help __PUNCT__
thi is an issu __PUNCT__ i won't __PUNCT__ but i could talk about for a long time __PUNCT__
we have move awai from what us to be call __PUNCT__ need base aid __PUNCT__ and meritocraci __PUNCT__
now that sound realli good __PUNCT__ caus we a meritocraci and we should award merit __PUNCT__
the problem is that need base wa often us to help young peopl from famili of more modest mean afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__
but if you push it so far toward merit base aid and you have no financi limit a lot of financi aid is now go to famili that can afford to pai all or most of the colleg cost for their own children __PUNCT__
and that mean that a lot of good __PUNCT__ hard work b student who ar try hard __PUNCT__ with good colleg stat ar just left out __PUNCT__
so we seen chang in the last twenti year that have realli tilt strongli against middl class famili __PUNCT__
that why i put forth thi agenda todai __PUNCT__ becaus if we don't get back to a better balanc we just go to see more and more colleg with student come from the top twenti __PUNCT__ five percent of our incom __PUNCT__
i got noth against that but i like an america where peopl up and down the incom scale ar go to have a chanc to live up to their dream __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i go to turn know to gene __PUNCT__ gene barton is a junior here at plymouth state __PUNCT__ he is the junior class vice presid __PUNCT__
he ha been work sinc she wa fourteen year old __PUNCT__
he ha had to take out both scholarship and loan __PUNCT__ to hi own credit __PUNCT__ to put himself through colleg __PUNCT__
he had a challeng life stori __PUNCT__ but now he major in polit scienc __PUNCT__ he plan to go to law school __PUNCT__
and i know that hi mother is veri proud of him __PUNCT__
and i think you could see in gene stori exactli what you want america to be __PUNCT__
hi mother __PUNCT__ and i have a quot here from gene __PUNCT__ he alwai want to go to school and go to colleg __PUNCT__
he alwai want to be a lawyer and be a judg on dai __PUNCT__
but in order to get where he want to be he had to go to a four __PUNCT__ year colleg __PUNCT__
and he work realli __PUNCT__ realli hard __PUNCT__ not onli to obtain that educ but to make the most of it __PUNCT__
gene do you want to share your thought with us __PUNCT__ gene barton __PUNCT__ inaud clionton __PUNCT__ ar you advertis __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ gene barton __PUNCT__ inaud clinton __PUNCT__ i hear thi a lot becaus if you get over the hurdl __PUNCT__ kim and ashlei ar face the first hurdl __PUNCT__ can you afford to get in __PUNCT__ and the second hurdl is __PUNCT__ can you afford to stai in __PUNCT__ and then the third hurdl is __PUNCT__ if you graduat __PUNCT__ can you afford to do what you want in life __PUNCT__ whether it graduat school __PUNCT__ profession educ or the job that you want __PUNCT__ becaus of debt that you incur __PUNCT__
now i a big believ in individu respons __PUNCT__ and i like that peopl have to pai __PUNCT__ like i said __PUNCT__ i had to pai for law school and the rest of that __PUNCT__
but i think we made it realli __PUNCT__ realli hard __PUNCT__
it so hard now that we ar lose young peopl who could make a contribut __PUNCT__
on of the propos i made the dai befor yesterdai about retir secur is to creat what i call __PUNCT__ american retir account __PUNCT__ that you can put monei into __PUNCT__ as soon as you start work __PUNCT__
and then if you do need monei for colleg __PUNCT__ or if you bui a home __PUNCT__ or other necessari expens like that __PUNCT__ you can draw it out tax __PUNCT__ free __PUNCT__
it goe in tax free it would come out tax free __PUNCT__ for you to be abl to us that monei __PUNCT__ becaus we need to creat more save __PUNCT__
part of the reason we in the bind we ar right now __PUNCT__ about why it so hard for so mani famili to afford colleg is that middl class incom have stagnat __PUNCT__
the averag famili incom ha lost a thousand dollar the last six year __PUNCT__
and so here we have peopl work hard __PUNCT__ two job __PUNCT__ sometim three job and their not get ahead while health care cost __PUNCT__ educ cost __PUNCT__ and energi cost ar go up __PUNCT__
so we got thi perfect storm where everybodi work hard and their not get ahead and we not make it easier __PUNCT__ we make it harder __PUNCT__
on of the thing that i propos __PUNCT__ that will help gene do __PUNCT__ is to get more resourc to reli on to be abl to go forward __PUNCT__ and i wish you well on that __PUNCT__
the whole point to the road to the middl class and try to make the middl class more prosper is that that is what america is __PUNCT__
you know you can find rich peopl anywher in the world __PUNCT__
and with all do respect rich peopl did not make america great __PUNCT__
thei made their contribut __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ the peopl who sacrif __PUNCT__ who fought the war __PUNCT__ who made the economi grow __PUNCT__ who did the hard work __PUNCT__ have been part of thi uniqu american invent __PUNCT__ thi huge middl class __PUNCT__
you know other countri ar follow in our wake __PUNCT__ you see them rais the standard of live __PUNCT__
but we been the pioneer __PUNCT__ and that enabl gener of american to live better than their parent and grandpar __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ know we ar in danger of stall __PUNCT__ and i don't want us to be the first gener of american to leav our countri wors than when we found it __PUNCT__
and that mean we got to have a new commit to do what it take to get the engin of econom and prosper for all __PUNCT__ move again __PUNCT__
and i confid we can do that __PUNCT__
but we got to help peopl to afford to make some of these life decis __PUNCT__
so i want to thank kim __PUNCT__ and ashlei and gene for share their stori __PUNCT__
it not easi come up in front of all of you and do that __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ doe anybodi have a microphon on them somewher __PUNCT__ do we __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__ so we go to call on peopl from now until the bell ring or whatev happen around here __PUNCT__
so why don't we __PUNCT__ i see a hand there __PUNCT__ the man in the blue shirt __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__ thank you for come to plymouth state __PUNCT__ my question also relat to educ __PUNCT__
my father got laid off three dai ago from hi job __PUNCT__
he wa a thirti __PUNCT__ five year eastern truck driver __PUNCT__
my concern is pai for colleg after we come to school is a great idea __PUNCT__
but for me __PUNCT__ as a student __PUNCT__ right now as a student __PUNCT__ thing like food and ga ar a luxuri __PUNCT__
i just got my car payment in and i work two job __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ it hard __PUNCT__
how can we help student not onli pai for colleg __PUNCT__ but how can we help them pai for the rise cost of ga __PUNCT__ text __PUNCT__ book __PUNCT__ and other issu that come up in a colleg career __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how mani peopl can relat to that question __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you know i sorri about your dad and i hope that thing turn around for him __PUNCT__
you know when i think about what we need to do to make is possibl for peopl to start __PUNCT__ continu and graduat __PUNCT__ i think we need to find wai to provid more aid that can be flexibl __PUNCT__
it great to pai for the room __PUNCT__ the tuition and the board __PUNCT__
and what i propos will give you more resourc to do that and then enabl you to shift some of that monei that you earn on your two job awai from live expens __PUNCT__
but it is still go to be a stretch for some peopl __PUNCT__
and i tell you __PUNCT__ when i wa in school there were a coupl of time when i had some expens that i couldn't meet __PUNCT__ and we had __PUNCT__ i went to wellselli __PUNCT__ which is a woman colleg __PUNCT__ outsid of boston __PUNCT__ and we had what we call the student aid societi __PUNCT__
and you could borrow monei in an emerg to meet your live expens __PUNCT__ with the promis that you would pai it back __PUNCT__ when it came time to pai it back __PUNCT__
you just sign you name __PUNCT__ there wa no big check you out or anyth like that __PUNCT__
you were a student and you made a promis to pai it back __PUNCT__
that help me out on more than on occas __PUNCT__ i have to tell you __PUNCT__ becaus like my dad said __PUNCT__ if i want to bui a book i had to earn it myself __PUNCT__
and i had to go and borrow monei from thi student aid societi to do exactli what you talk about __PUNCT__ to meet live expens and other need __PUNCT__
i don't know how mani colleg do that __PUNCT__ but i think it someth we ought to encourag more peopl to think about __PUNCT__
secondli __PUNCT__ i refer the program i start __PUNCT__ it wa made for singl parent __PUNCT__ but it doesn't have to be __PUNCT__ it wa __PUNCT__ philanthrop dollar __PUNCT__ and we did not give peopl grant for room __PUNCT__ board and tuition __PUNCT__ we gave them grant to handl live expens __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ if you can't get to class becaus your car break down __PUNCT__ you not go to be abl to continu your educ __PUNCT__
if you a singl parent and you can't find afford childcar __PUNCT__ you not go to be abl to continu your educ __PUNCT__
if you have a medic emerg and you an uninsur student __PUNCT__ you might be in troubl too __PUNCT__
so i think you exactli right __PUNCT__ we need to look for some creativ wai __PUNCT__ get some privat dollar in to supplement the public dollar that i talk about with tuition tax credit and other thing __PUNCT__
and i would just throw that out as an idea __PUNCT__
a lot of student __PUNCT__ and i respect thi young man stand up __PUNCT__ like when i felt so distraught and homesick when i wa at colleg becaus i didn't know if i would fit in __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ a lot of student feel that wai __PUNCT__ and thei think thei ar the onli person who is struggl with thi kind of issu __PUNCT__
but if we made it more transpar and said look we know we can help more peopl __PUNCT__ let get creativ about it __PUNCT__ i think that would be a wai of help tide peopl over and then you pai back __PUNCT__ it like a revolv loan fund __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when you get ahead you do that __PUNCT__
i think we need to look at other wai to do thi becaus that the main reason a lot of peopl drop out __PUNCT__
there live expens explod on them __PUNCT__ there emerg expens explod on them __PUNCT__
and there ar a lot of hard work peopl in thi state and around the unit state and i think we ought to think of wai we can help them more __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ that had right there __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__ hi __PUNCT__ i just want to ask __PUNCT__ i an ag out foster student __PUNCT__
i want to know __PUNCT__ there ar other state that ar help ag out foster student that get into colleg and everyth like that __PUNCT__ and i want to ask how you were plan to make the accept of an independ ag out foster youth __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ let me thank you for ask that question again __PUNCT__ that a courag question __PUNCT__
and i thank you for that __PUNCT__
you know i have spent a lot of my career as a lawyer repres and work for kid who ar in the foster care system __PUNCT__ and what she refer to is what call an ag out foster youth __PUNCT__
what that mean is that in the foster care system you haven't been adopt into a perman home __PUNCT__ it not a good idea for a lot of reason to return to your birth home __PUNCT__
and the foster system sai __PUNCT__ we finish __PUNCT__ when you turn eighteen and graduat high school __PUNCT__ in some state whichev happen first __PUNCT__
i have repres foster kid who when thei turn eighteen and have a semest left in high school and the state send a worker with a big __PUNCT__ black garbag bag to wherev the foster child is live __PUNCT__ thei put your belong in it and you on your own __PUNCT__
i know a lot of foster kid who have been veri resili and resourc and been abl to surviv that __PUNCT__ but i also known a lot that haven't __PUNCT__
a lot of kid who ag out of foster care finish high school and thei want to go to colleg __PUNCT__
now imagin if it as hard as it sound for all of you imagin what it is like to have no famili __PUNCT__ to have no credit __PUNCT__ thei have support you and know it over __PUNCT__
so i have focus on help a group you mai have heard of __PUNCT__
it got an unfortun name __PUNCT__ but it a wonder group call the orphan foundat __PUNCT__
the orphan foundat __PUNCT__ and if somebodi in your staff will find thi young woman __PUNCT__ i will connect you up to the orphan foundat __PUNCT__ which help to pai for colleg for ag out kid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you probabl don't think about it a lot __PUNCT__ but someth on the order of twenti to twenti __PUNCT__ five thousand kid ag out of foster care everi year __PUNCT__
and the on who do get to go to colleg __PUNCT__ i try to have a foster care student and colleg intern program and i got a coupl of great student who have intern in my offic __PUNCT__
and on thing you don't think about that thei educ me on is thei go to colleg which is a huge accomplish __PUNCT__ but where do thei go for the holidai __PUNCT__ on quot __PUNCT__ on woman said that __PUNCT__ all i ever want wa to have some place to go for thanksgiv __PUNCT__
and i think that thi is anoth area where if we could pai a littl more attent to each other __PUNCT__ if we listen to each other __PUNCT__ we can try to help each other __PUNCT__ you never know what that help might mean to somebodi __PUNCT__
and how that person in turn can help someon els __PUNCT__
so make sure that you connect up with somebodi on my staff __PUNCT__
thank __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ ye sir __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__ thank you senat __PUNCT__ i have two question __PUNCT__ the first is you talk a lot about student which is fantast __PUNCT__
would you have to rais tax to do that __PUNCT__ the second question is __PUNCT__ in the senat __PUNCT__ you support rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__
and as a busi major i been educ that thi devalu the dollar and it also put a lot of small busi out of busi __PUNCT__ creat opportun for big busi __PUNCT__
would you care to comment on that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i be happi to __PUNCT__
thank you and good luck in you busi career __PUNCT__
the first question __PUNCT__ how would i pai for what i want to do for colleg __PUNCT__ well i have propos a number of idea that i think ar import for america and put forth on my websit __URL__ how i would pai for each and everi on of them __PUNCT__
here how i would pai for improv afford for pai for colleg __PUNCT__ i would freez the estat tax at what would be the __NUM__ level __PUNCT__
i other word if you have an estat when you die of seven million dollar or less you will not pai tax __PUNCT__
if you have an estat more than seven million for a coupl __PUNCT__ you will __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i happen to believ that inherit wealth and concentr wealth is not good for america __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i am support in that belief __PUNCT__ not just by democrat __PUNCT__ but rememb the estat tax wa first propos by progress republican __PUNCT__ who believ in a meritocraci __PUNCT__ who understood that if we began to move toward concentr __PUNCT__ inherit __PUNCT__ gener health __PUNCT__ we would begin to undermin the motiv of the meritocraci __PUNCT__
so the estat tax __PUNCT__ if we freez it at the seven million dollar level __PUNCT__ and pleas go out and tell peopl __PUNCT__ there ar peopl who make fifti thousand dollar a year who ar worri thei go to be tax when thei die __PUNCT__ the republican have done such a good job confus thi issu __PUNCT__ and frankli mislead peopl __PUNCT__
so you can tell them under me unless thei make seven million dollar __PUNCT__ an estat of seven million __PUNCT__ there ar no tax __PUNCT__
but if we tax the estat abov seven million __PUNCT__ that will bring in four hundr billion dollar in ten year __PUNCT__
that how much monei it would give back __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i respect peopl like bill gate and warren buffet who state on hundr percent __PUNCT__ that thei oppos the repeal of the estat tax __PUNCT__
becaus thei know what inherit wealth doe to their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren __PUNCT__
so if warren buffet said __PUNCT__ i do thi in the interest of my famili dna __PUNCT__
i don't __PUNCT__ want lazi peopl who inherit their monei from me think that thei don't have to do anyth in their life __PUNCT__
and i don't want a lazi america __PUNCT__
and that the end of that __PUNCT__
so that how i would pai for becaus with that monei i would pai for retir account to help middl incom american pai for retir and i will help put more american off to work __PUNCT__
with respect to the minimum wage i have look at all the research __PUNCT__
we rais the minimum wage in __NUM__ dure on of the great expans of job creation in america __PUNCT__
small busi in the last twenti year have creat eighti percent of new job in america __PUNCT__
and there is no credibl evid that rais the minimum wage put busi out of busi __PUNCT__
what it doe is enabl peopl to move toward a more credibl standard of live __PUNCT__
i know there ar comment on the other side __PUNCT__ but the weight of the evid is veri clearli in favor of that __PUNCT__
we just rais the minimum wage again and the idea that rais tax alwai kill job is kind of hard to justifi on the basi of our last fifteen year of experi __PUNCT__
on of the wai my husband move us from to surplu and a balanc budget wa by rais tax on the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
and dure that eight year we saw the creation of twenti __PUNCT__ two million new job __PUNCT__
presid bush never met a tax cut for a wealthi person he didn't want to cut __PUNCT__
and we have not seen the kind of job creation that wa promis by enact those tax cut on the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ okai thei tell me i have on more and i saw thi ladi hand wai back there __PUNCT__ if you could get her a microphon __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__ i heard a rumor __PUNCT__ and the rumor wa that you were on the board of director at walmart __PUNCT__
the issu that pertain to me is the on of medic marijuana __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i wa on the board at walmart __PUNCT__
i wa on the board at walmart in the late nineteen eighti __PUNCT__
i work veri hard when i wa on the board to increas divers for women and minor at walmart __PUNCT__
and i also creat the first committe to look at environ impact of walmart __PUNCT__
that wa wai back in the 1980 __PUNCT__
i tri to encourag walmart to be more energi effici __PUNCT__ to us more recycl materi and so much els __PUNCT__
now i know that walmart polici ar on that do not reflect in my view __PUNCT__ the best wai of do busi and the valu that i think ar import in america like have big compani provid healthcar to the peopl who work for them __PUNCT__
and i intend to have a healthcar plan which i propos have an american choic plan that would requir walmart to provid health care to all employe and i think thei can afford it __PUNCT__ and i look forward to have that happen __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i also am a strong support of the employe free choic act __PUNCT__ make it easier for peopl to organ union becaus i think that the right to organ a union is a fundament human right __PUNCT__ not just a fundament american right __PUNCT__
so there ar chang that will come when i becom presid __PUNCT__
with respect to medic marijuana __PUNCT__ we had a lot of rhetor and the feder govern ha been veri intent upon on try to prevent state from be abl to offer that to peopl as an option to peopl who ar in pain __PUNCT__
i think we should be do medic research on it __PUNCT__
we ought to find were the element that claim to be exist in marijuana that might help peopl who ar suffer from cancer and nausea relat to treatment __PUNCT__ we ought to find that out __PUNCT__
i don't think we should decrimin it __PUNCT__
but we ought to do research and to what if ani benefit it ha __PUNCT__
rememb most painkil come from poppi __PUNCT__
you got all kind of drug that have benefit american and we ought to be do some research __PUNCT__ if there someth that could be made avail that would be legal we should look into that __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of peopl that ar suffer from debilit pain from medic treatment that thei undergo and there no reason thei should suffer needlessli if we can have a legal __PUNCT__ ethic framework to allevi that pain __PUNCT__
thank you all veri __PUNCT__ veri much __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__
