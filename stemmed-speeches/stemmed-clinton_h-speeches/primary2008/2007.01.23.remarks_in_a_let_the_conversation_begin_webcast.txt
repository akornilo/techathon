and tonight we have thi convers just hour befor the presid state of the union address __PUNCT__ so i think there a lot to talk about __PUNCT__
so let get start __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our campaign blogger __PUNCT__ is here with me again __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ crystal __PUNCT__ what tonight first question __PUNCT__ crystal patterson __PUNCT__ first question come from kathi in new briton __PUNCT__ connecticut __PUNCT__
she sai __PUNCT__ i watch you last night and thought you did great __PUNCT__
my question is how would you help our reserv who get hurt __PUNCT__ i understand __PUNCT__ becaus thei reserv __PUNCT__ thei don't get the same pai or medic help __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ kathi __PUNCT__ thank you so much for rais thi __PUNCT__
thi is an issu i been work on for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and you right __PUNCT__
there us to be a big dispar between the activ duti militari and the nation guard and reserv member __PUNCT__
thei were not given the same access toward health care and credit toward retir __PUNCT__ and we begun to chang that __PUNCT__
i team up with on of my republican colleagu __PUNCT__ senat lindsei graham from south carolina __PUNCT__ and we start with legisl to make sure our guard and reserv member and their famili had access to health insur __PUNCT__
not just when thei were deploi or activ __PUNCT__ but all the time __PUNCT__ becaus what we found is that a lot of them were self emploi or work for small employ who didn't provid health care __PUNCT__
and just like in the civilian world __PUNCT__ thei didn't have health insur for themselv and their famili __PUNCT__
so we ar begin to rectifi that __PUNCT__
we still have some work to do __PUNCT__ but at least we made some progress __PUNCT__
it been on of the most heartbreak experi for me to travel around new york and talk to our reservist and our guard member and hear about how difficult it wa for them to make sure their children have health insur __PUNCT__ and here thei were serv our countri __PUNCT__
i think we make progress __PUNCT__ but keep our feet to the fire becaus we have a lot more work to do __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from susan in greensboro __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
susan sai __PUNCT__ i keep hear that the u. __PUNCT__ economi is good __PUNCT__
pleas __PUNCT__ how can that be when we ow trillion of dollar to foreign countri __PUNCT__ don't you think we need a realiti check __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ that a great comment __PUNCT__ susan __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ i do think we need a realiti check __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the realiti is that __PUNCT__ when thi presid came into offic __PUNCT__ we had a balanc budget and a surplu __PUNCT__ and we were posit with those fund to be abl to deal with some of the problem that we face as a nation __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we do have to make sure that social secur is there in the futur __PUNCT__
we got to provid fund for medicar so that we take care of our senior __PUNCT__
a lot of other invest and opportun that we were pois to take care of __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that all gone __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ and we now ar in a seri of veri larg deficit __PUNCT__
our debt is grow __PUNCT__
and the problem that you point out is we ow a lot of monei to foreign lender __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what doe that mean __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it mean that __PUNCT__ in order to pai the interest on our debt __PUNCT__ we have to entic foreign bank and foreign investor to bui our debt instrument __PUNCT__ and that how we keep our govern go __PUNCT__
and who ar some of the peopl we ow the most monei to __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ like the govern of china __PUNCT__
and lot of time peopl ask me as i travel around new york __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ why can't we get tougher on china to make sure thei live up to trade agreement __PUNCT__ and i sai __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i wish we were get tough becaus there a lot to be concern about __PUNCT__ but i think thi administr can't figur out how to get tough on it banker __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ that is what we have creat is a situat where we now thi veri larg debtor nation __PUNCT__ and that is go to undermin our competit __PUNCT__
it undermin our strateg leadership in the world __PUNCT__
so there is a lot to be concern about __PUNCT__
i hope that __PUNCT__ in thi new democrat congress __PUNCT__ we start move back toward fiscal respons __PUNCT__
we ar certainli go to be try to tighten the budget rule that work so well in the 1990 __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ you can't do spend or even tax cut unless you can figur out how to pai for them __PUNCT__
that what work for us in the __PUNCT__ 90 __PUNCT__
we need to get back to it __PUNCT__ but we also have to be sensit to the fact that there a lot of problem that we left untend in the last year that we also go to have to address like health care __PUNCT__ like energi invest and climat chang __PUNCT__
so we have to strike the right balanc __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from peg in corn __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__
tonight the presid will give hi state of the union speech __PUNCT__
what ar your thought lead up to thi __PUNCT__ and is there anyth specif that you listen for __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the state of the union is a time for the presid to come and report to congress and the peopl __PUNCT__
i think that we need to make our union stronger than it is right now __PUNCT__
i sure the presid will put the best face on it from hi perspect __PUNCT__ but if we honest __PUNCT__ we know that we ar face veri danger and difficult situat in iraq and with iran and north korea and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the terribl problem in darfur and diseas and so mani difficulti that we have to confront __PUNCT__
and here at home i know veri well that __PUNCT__ in place like corn __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__ where there ar a lot of wonder __PUNCT__ hard work peopl __PUNCT__ it is a more difficult task to have a middl class lifestyl and afford health care and educ and all the other cost __PUNCT__
so i think the presid ha hi work cut out for him __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i will be listen for ani overtur that he make to the democrat congress becaus i believ in get thing done __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i work veri hard in corn __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ with a wonder new york compani call corn to solv some problem and creat new opportun for that great compani __PUNCT__
so i don't realli care where the good idea come from __PUNCT__
i just want to roll up our sleev and get to work __PUNCT__
i hear the presid go to talk about health care __PUNCT__ which i veri happi to hear although __PUNCT__ from what i hear about hi propos __PUNCT__ i can't sai i support those __PUNCT__
but the veri fact that he talk about how we can get the univers health care coverag perhap give us an opportun to work togeth __PUNCT__
similarli __PUNCT__ he go to be talk about energi __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ i don't think he go far enough __PUNCT__
i don't think he have the kind of propos that i believ will move us toward energi independ __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ open the door __PUNCT__ mayb invit the democrat to work with him __PUNCT__ move awai from the veri divis partisanship that he and the former republican congress displai is a good sign becaus we have a lot of work to do here in america __PUNCT__
and i hope tonight we have an invit for all of us to work togeth __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from laura in chicago __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__
she sai __PUNCT__ we ar a middl __PUNCT__ class famili with two great kid with parent that work veri hard __PUNCT__ sacrific as much as thei can and volunt to help the school commun as much as possibl __PUNCT__
despit our best effort __PUNCT__ we can't afford health care __PUNCT__
the onli place we can afford a home is in a drug and gang infest neighborhood __PUNCT__ and we can't save a penni for the futur __PUNCT__
what would you do to help young middl class famili like our to have a better prospect for the futur __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you have realli sum up the problem that is not just confront young middl class famili __PUNCT__ but so mani of our famili __PUNCT__
and i applaud you for work as hard as you can and have your famili stai tight togeth with your parent and your kid __PUNCT__
but i realli sympath becaus it is harder to maintain the qualiti of life and the standard of live that we should take for grant in america __PUNCT__
so you need help from your govern __PUNCT__ and i don't think that should be __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ someth that peopl turn their nose up at __PUNCT__
becaus i know that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ when my father got back from world war ii __PUNCT__ our countri did a lot to get us up and go __PUNCT__
and we had great school and road program that connect up our countri __PUNCT__
and we had a wonder commit about how we were go to plan for the futur and have a better life __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that what we need to get back to __PUNCT__
i think we need to renew the promis of america for famili like your __PUNCT__
so what doe that mean __PUNCT__ it mean we tackl health care cost __PUNCT__
we got to get them down __PUNCT__ and we have to provid qualiti afford health care __PUNCT__
on sundai i put forward a propos that would insur everi child __PUNCT__
i want to go to the point __PUNCT__ where if you a famili of four make sever thousand dollar a year __PUNCT__ you be elig for the famili health care program __PUNCT__
i want to make health insur afford for everyon __PUNCT__
we have to give you plan for the educ of your children __PUNCT__
we have to make it easier for you and your husband to save __PUNCT__
i have some propos about how we can do that __PUNCT__
with your parent __PUNCT__ i assum thei still work __PUNCT__ as you said in your question __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let make sure that thei can save for retir __PUNCT__ that thei ar abl to be as independ as possibl __PUNCT__
we had the retir system realli rip out from under american __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the kind of defin benefit pension that previou gener count on ar realli a vanish breed __PUNCT__
the defin contribut __PUNCT__ we have to make it easier for peopl to invest __PUNCT__ and we have to put __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ more inform into the marketplac so peopl can make good decis and plan for the futur __PUNCT__
we also need to be sure that we start to tackl energi cost __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ it someth that is not go to go awai __PUNCT__ and we have to help famili by give them better tool to conserv and be more effici and make better choic in the marketplac __PUNCT__
there is realli a lot that can be done at the government level __PUNCT__ but i want to add anoth factor here __PUNCT__
for a lot of our hard work famili __PUNCT__ i think thei feel kind of let down __PUNCT__ even betrai by their employ __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there not that sens that we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
and too mani of our corpor leader ar not realli share the wealth with their employ __PUNCT__
product is up __PUNCT__
that mean american ar work harder __PUNCT__
we actual work harder than peopl anywher in the world on averag __PUNCT__
and profit ar up for our compani __PUNCT__
but where ar the wage increas __PUNCT__ where ar the you know __PUNCT__ the benefit that should accru to hard work american __PUNCT__
so i would realli like to call on corpor leadership to do more __PUNCT__ and i want to support in everi wai i can the union movement in our countri becaus a strong union movement ha realli been part of the american dream and on of the pillar of the american middl class __PUNCT__
we go to try in thi democrat congress to make it easier for peopl who want to join union to do so __PUNCT__
we go to try to make it easier to bargain __PUNCT__
we got to get back to a balanc of power __PUNCT__
all of the power is on on side of the econom equat __PUNCT__ name with the employ __PUNCT__ and employe can't realli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ get their fair share of the wonder wealth and benefit that ar be creat for peopl at the higher end of the incom spectrum __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ that doesn't work for america becaus __PUNCT__ with all due respect __PUNCT__ america wa not built and becom a great countri becaus we have rich peopl __PUNCT__
you can find rich peopl anywher in the world __PUNCT__
we a great countri becaus of famili like your __PUNCT__ and i hope that we go to get back to more of a balanc and provid some of those build block again that will give you and your famili a leg up on a better futur __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from tom in roanok __PUNCT__
if elect presid __PUNCT__ would you make the fda into a true champion of good for the peopl instead of just a lackei for the enorm drug compani __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i realli glad you ask that becaus i have been fight to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ reassert the independ and the scientif stand of the fda __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the fda __PUNCT__ still __PUNCT__ despit all of it problem __PUNCT__ remain the gold standard for all the drug and food safeti in the world __PUNCT__
but you obvious have follow thi __PUNCT__ and you know that what ha happen in the last six year is the politic of the fda __PUNCT__
i had a real struggl with them over someth call plan b __PUNCT__ which is the morn after pill for contracept __PUNCT__ and becaus of ideolog __PUNCT__ thi administr didn't want the fda to make it judgment about thi particular drug base on it safeti and it effect __PUNCT__
so i and my colleagu __PUNCT__ senat patti murrai from washington __PUNCT__ we wage a battl sai __PUNCT__ we not go to tell you how to decid __PUNCT__
we want you to decid base on the best evid and follow the weight of scienc __PUNCT__
so what i hope is that we will be abl to reassert the independ and the integr of the fda __PUNCT__
we also have to buttress the fda abil to not just approv drug __PUNCT__ but to follow what happen with those drug __PUNCT__ to do the kind of after approv test __PUNCT__
we need more compar effect __PUNCT__ someth that i have been advoc and pass an amend to the medicar prescript drug benefit __PUNCT__
let compar drug __PUNCT__ and so we know that consum __PUNCT__ the clinician __PUNCT__ whether these drug ar good __PUNCT__
whether thei realli make a differ __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the fda is respons for a lot of our food suppli __PUNCT__ but thei don't have the personnel and resourc necessari __PUNCT__ and we had some realli tragic situat in the last coupl of year where e __PUNCT__ coli ha kill peopl and been trace to our veget __PUNCT__ our produc __PUNCT__
the fda is respons for that part of our food suppli __PUNCT__
i think we should have on agenc respons for food safeti __PUNCT__ but until we can get to that kind of gold standard __PUNCT__ let increas the resourc go to the fda __PUNCT__ and let put it back into the busi of scienc and not ideolog dictat from polit leader __PUNCT__
that my goal __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ pierr from georgia ask __PUNCT__ what will you do to restor confid and the integr in our vote system __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ pierr __PUNCT__ thi is a passion of mine __PUNCT__
i introduc a veri comprehens bill call the count everi vote act becaus __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ we have discov ever sinc our __NUM__ elect __PUNCT__ we have lot of problem with the integr of our vote system __PUNCT__
mani of you know the problem we got with the electron vote machin __PUNCT__ and we got to have better standard and make sure that we not engag in bui machin that have owner and compani with conflict of interest __PUNCT__
we got to have better protect and safeti against hack or ani kind of interfer with these machin __PUNCT__
there ar other problem as well __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ have seen a histori of intimid __PUNCT__ peopl be call and told that thei shouldn't vote __PUNCT__ or thei ar be told to vote on a differ dai than the actual elect __PUNCT__ or have a flier when thei come out of church which sai __PUNCT__ if you ever had a park ticket __PUNCT__ you not elig to vote __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ horribl kind of interfer and destruct of the most import constitut right that a citizen ha __PUNCT__ the franchis to exercis hi or her voic __PUNCT__
there a lot that i want to do to improv the vote system __PUNCT__ and mayb now that we have a democrat congress __PUNCT__ we will tackl thi __PUNCT__
i know that that is on the mind of a lot of my colleagu __PUNCT__ and it is someth i hear about everywher __PUNCT__
peopl ar constantli ask me __PUNCT__ what can we do to get the vote system to onc again have integr __PUNCT__ to earn the confid of the peopl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we suppos to be the model of democraci to countri around the world __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to have a vote system that is a laughingstock and where peopl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ basic don't believ in it anymor __PUNCT__
that would be the begin of the end for the trust that is need in a democraci like our __PUNCT__
so i go to keep that on the veri top of my prioriti list and work with my fellow democrat to try to make some of the chang we need __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from dave in detroit __PUNCT__
the last few presid publicli show their leisur time activ __PUNCT__ such as fish __PUNCT__ jog __PUNCT__ swim __PUNCT__ tenni __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__

i run like a tortois __PUNCT__
but i love to get outdoor __PUNCT__ and i love take brisk walk __PUNCT__
my husband and i do that all around where we live in new york __PUNCT__
i also do work out __PUNCT__
not as often or as faithfulli as i should __PUNCT__ but i try to __PUNCT__
and i love swim __PUNCT__
whenev i get a chanc __PUNCT__
ani kind of water __PUNCT__ whether it the ocean __PUNCT__ a lake __PUNCT__ a pool __PUNCT__ i realli love be in the out of door __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ for me __PUNCT__ i don't get enough time in the job that i have now to be __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ outsid in natur __PUNCT__ but there noth i like better than go to on of the beauti park and preserv that we have near where we live __PUNCT__
we take our dog seamu __PUNCT__ our labrador __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ for those of you who follow our first dog in the white hous __PUNCT__ buddi __PUNCT__ who tragic di in a road accid __PUNCT__ seamu is buddi great nephew __PUNCT__ and we go for long walk and have a wonder time just be outsid in all sort of weather __PUNCT__
that where i feel veri much at peac __PUNCT__
occasion __PUNCT__ i ride a bike __PUNCT__
i us to do that much more when i wa in the white hous __PUNCT__
i us to take a bike and go down to the pathwai along the canal here in washington and ride __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a long wai __PUNCT__ turn around and come back __PUNCT__
i found it veri rest __PUNCT__
i don't get to do that quit as much as i like to __PUNCT__
but those ar the thing that i love to do outdoor __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ lucinda from ft __PUNCT__ myer __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__ what ar your thought on bring our troop home from iraq __PUNCT__ and what should be our exit strategi __PUNCT__ ar you go to vote for addit fund to support thi war __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ lucinda __PUNCT__ i against the presid escal __PUNCT__
i do not believ thi is the right strategi __PUNCT__
for more than a year and a half __PUNCT__ i have advoc someth quit differ __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we need to start redeploi our troop out of harm wai __PUNCT__
we need to put pressur on the iraqi govern to stand up for itself __PUNCT__ to provid it own secur __PUNCT__
and on of the wai it ha to do that is by tackl the polit and econom problem in the countri __PUNCT__
thei have not been will to step up and do that __PUNCT__
and i would like to see our govern put more pressur on the iraqi govern so that thei would begin to do so __PUNCT__
i don't see that as a part of thi plan __PUNCT__
the presid make some vagu refer to have benchmark for the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ but he doesn't share them with the congress __PUNCT__
we don't know what he go to try to expect the iraqi govern to do __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ thirdli __PUNCT__ i would veri much like to see the intern commun involv in thi __PUNCT__
that what the iraq studi group recommend __PUNCT__
i think it inevit __PUNCT__ and i don't understand why thi white hous won't engag with the neighbor in the region __PUNCT__ includ peopl that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ ar obvious not friend of our __PUNCT__ like iran and syria __PUNCT__
but i know that we had exampl where thi ha work in the past __PUNCT__
we had an arm servic committe hear earlier todai to have gener petraeu __PUNCT__ who the presid ha chosen to lead thi new strategi __PUNCT__
he a wonder man __PUNCT__ a great soldier __PUNCT__
and i think a number of us on the committe told us we have great confid in him __PUNCT__
we just don't have confid in thi strategi __PUNCT__
we want to protect our troop __PUNCT__
we want to keep give them the resourc thei need becaus thei still don't have the armor vehicl that thei ar in need of __PUNCT__ to protect themselv from these horribl bomb and improvis explos devic that thei ar constantli in danger of __PUNCT__
so we ar absolut unit across the parti divid to support our troop __PUNCT__
and if the presid is go forward with thi strategi __PUNCT__ as he appear to be do __PUNCT__ then we want to make sure we protect our young men and women __PUNCT__
but it the wrong strategi __PUNCT__ and we wish he would revers cours and do what mani of us would believ would have a better chanc of requir the iraqi govern to do it part __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ make sure that the peopl in the region had an oblig that thei had to fulfil to try to make iraq more secur and stabl __PUNCT__
and begin __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ move our troop out of harm wai __PUNCT__
that what i would like to see him do instead of thi escal strategi he follow __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ eric from kalamazoo __PUNCT__ michigan __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ although a diehard democrat __PUNCT__ i often disappoint by the lack of vocal support from parti leader on issu of gai and lesbian civil equal __PUNCT__
i realiz thi is a divis topic __PUNCT__ but i would like to know __PUNCT__ if you were made presid __PUNCT__ would you be comfort in address issu and comfort support plan __PUNCT__ polici or initi that advanc and protect the civil liberti of gai and lesbian __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
and i feel veri strongli about that __PUNCT__
we have legisl pend in the congress to do two thing __PUNCT__ which i support wholeheartedli __PUNCT__
on is to end discrimin against gai and lesbian __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the enda bill __PUNCT__ it call __PUNCT__ ha been pend for some time __PUNCT__
i hope we can bring it up and perhap pass it in thi democrat congress becaus __PUNCT__ as you mai know __PUNCT__ or as you person have experienc __PUNCT__ there is still discrimin in the workplac and in other set in our societi __PUNCT__
and no matter how anyon might feel about some of these issu __PUNCT__ which you have describ __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ as american __PUNCT__ we certainli can be against discrimin against anyon __PUNCT__
secondli __PUNCT__ i like to see the hate crime legisl to be amend to includ ani kind of hate crime on the basi of sexual orient __PUNCT__ which is what the languag in the bill current sai __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i hope we can bring that up as well __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ it overdu __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ i support civil union __PUNCT__
i think that thi is a matter that histor ha been left to the state becaus that where decis like these ar made __PUNCT__
but i have been on record support civil union and equal in relationship __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there so mani discriminatori effect that peopl mai not realiz __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ you know so well __PUNCT__ not be abl to inherit __PUNCT__ not be abl to own properti togeth in some place __PUNCT__ not be abl to visit your partner in the hospit __PUNCT__ and so much els __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think that __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ regardless of how some have tri to politic these issu in what i think of as a quit mean spirit wai __PUNCT__ pit peopl against their brother and sister and neighbor and colleagu __PUNCT__ i think that american ar fair mind __PUNCT__ and we move forward on an agenda of equal __PUNCT__

crystal patterson __PUNCT__ melissa from martinez __PUNCT__ georgia __PUNCT__ ha our last question for thi even __PUNCT__
with the rise cost of health insur __PUNCT__ where do you stand in help make sure all american have health insur __PUNCT__ like larg employ get larg discount to help provid coverag to their employe __PUNCT__
wouldn't the u. __PUNCT__ get a big discount for purchas insur by the million to cover all u. __PUNCT__ citizen __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that a veri smart point becaus it true __PUNCT__
there is on huge purchas pool that is known as the feder employe health benefit plan __PUNCT__ and if you a feder employe __PUNCT__ you have choic among all differ kind of insur polici __PUNCT__ and the rate ar good becaus the feder govern bargain for better rate __PUNCT__
if you ar a veteran who get health care at the va __PUNCT__ the va get to bargain to get prescript drug cost down __PUNCT__
we try to get that same opportun to negoti in the medicar prescript drug program __PUNCT__
becaus the point you make is absolut right __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ larg employ __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ bargain with pharmaceut compani __PUNCT__ with insur compani in order to get the cost down becaus thei bui in bulk __PUNCT__
