on particular question that i hear a lot about todai is what is happen with the economi __PUNCT__ where ar we __PUNCT__ thi economi mai be work for some peopl __PUNCT__ but it sure isn't work for everybodi __PUNCT__
part of what we got to decid is whether we ar just go to allow thi economi to flip into recess __PUNCT__
the economist can argu about it __PUNCT__ you can see them on tv __PUNCT__
some sai __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ it go there __PUNCT__

if you lost your job becaus construct ha slow down __PUNCT__ you don't care what the economist ar talk about __PUNCT__ do you __PUNCT__ what you care about is who is go to help me __PUNCT__ i get up everydai and i try to work and there is not work there __PUNCT__
if you lost your health care becaus the insur compani refus to pai for the problem you and your famili have __PUNCT__ or thei won't even give it to you in the first place or your employ no longer provid it __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter what somebodi in washington is talk about __PUNCT__

everi on of us work our wai into the posit we ar __PUNCT__ nobodi hand us the silver platter __PUNCT__
some of us broke some barrier to get there __PUNCT__
we know someth about work hard and we know someth about what it mean to reward that hard work __PUNCT__
the wai america ha alwai work is that if you wile to work hard and take respons __PUNCT__ you will get ahead __PUNCT__
you will make progress __PUNCT__
your children will have more and better opportun than you have had __PUNCT__
you can look back at your parent and your grandpar and know what pride thei must feel becaus of the progress that you and america have made togeth __PUNCT__
that is why i am run for presid __PUNCT__ becaus i want to make sure the purpos of america __PUNCT__ which is that progress and that pride continu for that littl girl there and everi other singl child in america __PUNCT__
long befor you heard folk talk about mayb we slide into a recess __PUNCT__ i saw it and i felt it __PUNCT__
i repres a lot of hardwork peopl across the countri in new york __PUNCT__
and thei began to sai __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__ it like nobodi even see us ani more __PUNCT__
we have a presid __PUNCT__ we have a govern that just doesn't seem to understand what go on in the live of peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it almost like we invis __PUNCT__ peopl told me __PUNCT__
that is not the america that i grew up in __PUNCT__ that is not the america that i want to be there for our futur __PUNCT__
so there will be no invis american when i am presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ polit isn't a game __PUNCT__ it is seriou busi about our futur __PUNCT__
it is about help everyon get the tool thei need to make the most of their own god give potenti __PUNCT__
it about your voic __PUNCT__ your dream __PUNCT__ your futur __PUNCT__
and so when i see a problem __PUNCT__ i know that america up to meet it __PUNCT__
if we have leader who understand we have to pull togeth __PUNCT__
we got to be unit __PUNCT__ we got to try to bring peopl togeth in order to address the big challeng we face in america __PUNCT__
there noth america can't do if we make up our mind to do it togeth __PUNCT__
that is the common purpos of america and that will be the purpos of my presid __PUNCT__ to listen to you __PUNCT__ to be your voic in the white hous __PUNCT__ and to deliv result for you and your famili __PUNCT__ everi singl dai __PUNCT__
so here what we have to decid __PUNCT__
we have an economi that despit the happi talk from the white hous and the republican is not work for most american __PUNCT__
you know that __PUNCT__
the averag american famili lost a thousand dollar in incom over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
health care premium have doubl __PUNCT__
energi cost have gone up __MONEY__ sinc georg bush becam presid __PUNCT__
i know sometim peopl try to act like fact don't matter __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ fact kind of get in the wai of fill rhetor or polit combat __PUNCT__
fact ar stubborn and fact actual reflect the realiti of what is go on in peopl live __PUNCT__
and you think about all the talk from presid bush about tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__
i tell you what __PUNCT__ if you wealthi and well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ that talk turn into action __PUNCT__
but if you ar a middl class __PUNCT__ work famili __PUNCT__ whatev tax cut you got from georg bush __PUNCT__ your energi cost went up three time more __PUNCT__
so we not go to make progress on a lot of these tough issu until we realiz that we got to get the two oil men out of the white hous and begin to chang direct __PUNCT__
now i have laid out a long term strategi about how we go to stabil and grow the economi __PUNCT__
i want to get back to where we see million of new __PUNCT__ good job creat in america __PUNCT__
i know we can do that __PUNCT__
but i don't think we can wait until __DATE__ of next year __PUNCT__
too mani peopl will be hurt __PUNCT__
too mani job will be lost __PUNCT__
too mani home will be foreclos on __PUNCT__
too mani more peopl will go without health care __PUNCT__
we cannot wait __PUNCT__
that is why i am call on the presid and the congress to work togeth to come up with some quick action to be abl to present the slide toward recess __PUNCT__
unlik presid bush __NUM__ plan which focus on tax cut in the wealthiest of american __PUNCT__ my plan focu on middl class and hardwork famili who deserv the relief and need the help right now __PUNCT__
now here what i would do tomorrow if i could __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i propos a thirti billion dollar fund to help hard __PUNCT__ hit commun and distress home owner whether the foreclosur crisi __PUNCT__
right here __PUNCT__ right here in california __PUNCT__ you have __NUM__ home in foreclosur right now __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ nevada ha the highest rate of home foreclosur in america __PUNCT__
i sat down at a restaur in vega talk to peopl who have alreadi lost their home __PUNCT__
what happen in vega when it come to foreclosur __PUNCT__ can't stai in vega __PUNCT__
we got to talk about it across our countri __PUNCT__
thi fund would give state and commun __PUNCT__ it would give the mayor __PUNCT__ it would give the speaker __PUNCT__ it would give the lieuten governor __PUNCT__ it would give you resourc to provid at risk famili with desper need servic like financi counsel and legal assist and help refinanc these unwork __PUNCT__ unafford loan and state and commun could also us these fund to offset the cost associ with rise foreclosur __PUNCT__
everyth from maintain vacant properti to servic like commun polic __PUNCT__
becaus sometim peopl have talk about hi mortgag crisi in a veri narrow wai __PUNCT__
certain peopl ar at risk of lose their home or alreadi have without see the broad implic of thi __PUNCT__
if you have home foreclosur in a neighborhood __PUNCT__ you ar like in thi hous market __PUNCT__ to have vacant properti __PUNCT__
when you have vacant properti you attract peopl that you don't want to be near your kid __PUNCT__
you begin to have lower properti tax revenu so servic get cut back which make the problem even wors __PUNCT__
i want us to start understand that on everi problem we face in america __PUNCT__ we in it togeth __PUNCT__
it not us versu them __PUNCT__ it is all of us togeth __PUNCT__ we have to come up with solut and i believ we can start by focus on them __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i call for comprehens action to end the hous crisi and keep it from drag down the entir economi __PUNCT__
here what i would do __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ i call for a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ dai moratorium on foreclosur __PUNCT__
no foreclosur for three month __PUNCT__
so if the bank is about to foreclos on your home __PUNCT__ you have some breath room to try to figur out how to restructur your mortgag __PUNCT__
becaus here what happen __PUNCT__ start last march i said __PUNCT__ we had predatori lend practic __PUNCT__ we had peopl who put homeown into mortgag thei couldn't afford becaus thei got more monei for have a higher interest rate mortgag __PUNCT__ we have a lot of peopl who could pai a good interest rate on a mortgag who were push into the ajudst rate mortgag and onc thei go up __PUNCT__ thei beyond somebodi __PUNCT__ abil to pai for it __PUNCT__
we have a lot of famili who right now could stai in their home and pai the mortgag thei pai but a lot of pressur is come from the investor who bought all of these mortgag __PUNCT__
becaus you understand it not your local bank __PUNCT__ it not the fellow who sold it to you who now hold the mortgag __PUNCT__ it somebodi sit in shanghai or in dubai or berlin or in london or somewher els in the world and what thei sai is __PUNCT__ ok i suppos to get an interest rate return up here and if you stop me from get that then i not get the return on my invest __PUNCT__
that why last month i went to wall street __PUNCT__ i repres wall street and i proud to do that becaus there ar a lot of thing that come out of there that rais wealth and give peopl opportun but on thi issu wall street is complicit with the bank and the mortgag broker and the lender and everybodi who took advantag of american in thi mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
so if we can get a moratorium then we can get peopl to come in and sai look why would you take somebodi home awai becaus then you got a vacant properti you probabl not go to be abl to sell __PUNCT__ thei pai __MONEY__ now you want to jump it up to __MONEY__ you know thei can't pai that __PUNCT__
do you want some kind of return on your invest or you want a foreclosur with noth ahead __PUNCT__ then i want to sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we have to freez interest rate for five year __PUNCT__
let just sai we not go to rais the interest rate on our mortgag __PUNCT__
we want to convert these unafford mortgag into loan that famili can afford __PUNCT__
so if you have an adjust rate mortgag that is about to skyrocket __PUNCT__ you have the chanc to stai in your home and pai afford payment __PUNCT__
now we go to have to end the abus practic that got us to where we ar __PUNCT__
and let me just mention on becaus it is the on that i get the most upset about and i heard about it yesterdai talk to homeown in nevada __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl who were first time homeown or who move from a veri small home with a grow famili to a larger on __PUNCT__ sign these mortgag paper __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ i skim my mortgag paper __PUNCT__ i didn't read them __PUNCT__
i didn't know what wa all that fine print and those page and page of legales and most peopl who sign on the dot line reli on what thei were told __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl who were these first time homeown __PUNCT__ thei want to do the right thing __PUNCT__
thei talk to their friend and their famili __PUNCT__ peopl said __PUNCT__ you got a hous now __PUNCT__ if you can pai it off you own it free and clear sooner __PUNCT__
in addit to the interest payment peopl start put a littl bit more in the check __PUNCT__ becaus thei thought thei were do the right thing __PUNCT__
what thei did not know is that there is a provis in a lot of these mortgag for prepay penalti __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ you tri to do the right thing in your mind and you got hammer with an automat increas in interest rate becaus the investor didn't want you to pai it off ani sooner __PUNCT__ thei want to penal you from try __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of peopl out there who ar be punish for do what we would have thought wa the right thing __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ next __PUNCT__ we got to invest in emerg energi assist for famili with skyrocket heat bill thi winter __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ million famili across america ar elig for thi assist __PUNCT__ but onli about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ receiv it __PUNCT__
a lot of parent and the mayor and i met a lot of peopl in new hampshir and in iowa in the snow __PUNCT__ in the below zero chill factor __PUNCT__ who were sai us __PUNCT__ how am i go to afford to pai my util bill __PUNCT__ i can't go without the heat how am i go to afford to pai it __PUNCT__ well mayb i won't take my prescript drug __PUNCT__
mayb i postpon the mortgag payment and hope that i can catch up with it later __PUNCT__
so we got to do more to get that assist directli to peopl __PUNCT__
and that why i would provid an addit __MONEY__ billion in emerg assist __PUNCT__ enough to cover everi singl person who need it so we can do the right thing __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ i would extend and expand unemploy insur __PUNCT__ includ doubl the number of week peopl ar elig for assist __PUNCT__
becaus if you out of work and you struggl to find a job __PUNCT__ you deserv a littl extra help becaus if the economi is slide into recess __PUNCT__ there might not be a job there for you so what ar you and your famili suppos to live on and besid if you get that monei in your pocket you spend it and that will give the economi an immedi boost which will help us from go deeper into econom troubl final __PUNCT__ i told you what i would do to try to solv the problem __PUNCT__
here what i would do to seiz the opportun __PUNCT__
it ha everyth to do with what the ibew is do along with neca becaus thi is exactli where i would put monei __PUNCT__
i would take immedi step to jump __PUNCT__ start __PUNCT__ green collar __PUNCT__ job growth all across america __PUNCT__
sometim when i talk about thi i get blank stare to be honest __PUNCT__
i realli do becaus peopl can't know it if thei haven't seen it __PUNCT__
thei know about white collar job thei know about blue collar job but the idea of green collar job is someth that folk ar just begin to appreci __PUNCT__
i team up with on of my fellow senat a few month ago and we pass legisl to put feder dollar into train peopl for green collar job what i want to do is acceler that monei to come to place like here to train more peopl __PUNCT__
these renew energi job ar high wage job that cannot be outsourc __PUNCT__
thi is what we ought to be invest in with feder dollar right now __PUNCT__
number on __PUNCT__ i would immedi implement a green build fund to rebuild and renov public build like school __PUNCT__ like municip build __PUNCT__ like law enforc build __PUNCT__ to make them more energi effici __PUNCT__
we know how to do thi and i would do it immedi __PUNCT__
i would issu an execut order sai there will not be ani new feder build built or ani on of the __NUM__ that we have now renov unless thei becom energi effici and move toward carbon neutral __PUNCT__
thi would creat ten of thousand __PUNCT__ eventu hundr of thousand and million of new good job __PUNCT__
peopl would be put to work instal those solar panel on displai here and other countri ar head of us __PUNCT__
but that doesn't mean anyth becaus we can catch up in a hurri if we put our mind to it __PUNCT__
but you got to know __PUNCT__
take germani __PUNCT__ germani decid to invest dollar in new energi particularli solar __PUNCT__
last time i look __PUNCT__ i don't think the climat in germani is as good as it is here in california but thei have put nearli __NUM__ peopl to work in a much smaller economi instal solar panel __PUNCT__ make the displai __PUNCT__ do what is necessari to actual move practic and quickli toward renew energi __PUNCT__
i would also pursu a crash weather plan to help peopl insul their home you can save up to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ on your energi bill if you start todai __PUNCT__
and that is obvious heat in the cold and cool in the hot __PUNCT__
you can save __NUM__ __PUNCT__ but a lot of peopl don't know how to do that __PUNCT__ thei don't understand it __PUNCT__
again here ar job go into insul home __PUNCT__ make sure that you have thicker glass __PUNCT__ look for wai to deliv on that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ save __PUNCT__
i would begin to ask the util to in vest in conserv __PUNCT__
it is in their long __PUNCT__ term interest but more importantli it is in america long __PUNCT__ term interest that we start save on energi __PUNCT__
here i have to applaud california becaus back in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ which some of us can rememb __PUNCT__ a lot of us wait in line for ga for a long time __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ marvin __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ i rememb get my littl __PUNCT__ crummi car in line at __NUM__ a.m __PUNCT__ spend an hour or two have somebodi from the ga station walk down the car and sai __PUNCT__ we run out of ga __PUNCT__ why don't you try the station down the road __PUNCT__ when that happen it should have been the biggest wake __PUNCT__ up call in american histori __PUNCT__
we saw some chang __PUNCT__ i give credit to presid jimmi carter __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ we got to do better __PUNCT__
we got to conserv more __PUNCT__ we got to be more energi effici __PUNCT__
you know what happen __PUNCT__
the price of oil fell and so everybodi said __PUNCT__ thank good we don't have to do ani of that stuff __PUNCT__
and we got lull into a fals sens of secur __PUNCT__
but not california __PUNCT__ california took a hard look at ga mileag and began to make some chang __PUNCT__ took a hard look at electr usag and todai __PUNCT__ on averag __PUNCT__ a californian us __NUM__ __PUNCT__ less electr than anybodi anywher els in america __PUNCT__
california ha led the wai __PUNCT__ made a differ __PUNCT__
and i am strongli support of what the state is try to do to begin to regul tailpip emiss __PUNCT__
it been a big fight with the epa and the bush administr but california can be the leader again __PUNCT__
i would also do more to offer tax credit sooner rather than later for consum who make energi effici purchas __PUNCT__ from upgrad your applianc __PUNCT__ to bui hybrid vehicl __PUNCT__ to instal new window in your home __PUNCT__
we all know that thi is not onli the right thing to do __PUNCT__ thi is smart __PUNCT__
it save you monei __PUNCT__
i just recent wa brief about a new plug __PUNCT__ in electr car that run on a new batteri by an american car maker __PUNCT__ becaus that my goal __PUNCT__ to have these car made right here in america __PUNCT__
and after test drive it for six month __PUNCT__ thei got __NUM__ mile on ten gallon of ga __PUNCT__
becaus think about thi __PUNCT__ if henri ford were to come back todai and go out in the park lot here and ask a coupl of the ibew member to let him look at your car __PUNCT__ he be amaz at the size and the power __PUNCT__ he be amaz at the gp __PUNCT__ the fact that somebodi would talk to you and tell you where to go __PUNCT__ that would be astonish __PUNCT__ that scienc fiction __PUNCT__ and then he would lift up the hood __PUNCT__ and what would he see __PUNCT__ the intern combust engin __PUNCT__
it realli hasn't chang that much sinc the model t __PUNCT__
we need to have a strateg energi fund that is look at how we have new technolog like what you ar do right here __PUNCT__ with everyth from our vehicl to our home to our busi to our util and make it a comprehens plan __PUNCT__
if the economi continu to worsen __PUNCT__ if all of what i just propos were put into place as an immedi jumpstart to get econom action go __PUNCT__ to get consum spend again __PUNCT__ then i think we should look at provid an addit __MONEY__ billion in tax rebat to work and middl class famili __PUNCT__ not to the wealthi __PUNCT__ thei have more than gotten their share of our tax dollar __PUNCT__
thi relief would follow the same principl as the other initi i outlin todai __PUNCT__
it would provid immedi __PUNCT__ short __PUNCT__ term help __PUNCT__ target to those in most in need and it would be fiscal respons __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ will thi be easi __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it isn't easi __PUNCT__ but i think if it were easi some other countri would do it __PUNCT__
we the peopl who ar suppos to do what is hard __PUNCT__
we the innov nation __PUNCT__
we the folk who roll up our sleev and get to work togeth __PUNCT__
year from now i hope that our children and grandchildren will look back at thi elect and sai __PUNCT__ wow __PUNCT__ thank good __PUNCT__
thi is when america came back and we came back strong __PUNCT__
right now we in a big hole __PUNCT__ we got to dig ourselv out __PUNCT__
i want to pass out shovel to everybodi __PUNCT__ becaus i don't think it in america interest to borrow monei from the chines to bui oil from the saudi __PUNCT__
i am go to do everyth i can to make sure that we solv our problem __PUNCT__
elect ar not just about speech __PUNCT__ thei not just about all the camera show up __PUNCT__
thei ar about what happen when a leader ha to final make some tough decis __PUNCT__
we got challeng around the world __PUNCT__ end the war and deal with all of the problem we ar go to inherit from presid bush __PUNCT__
we have econom challeng __PUNCT__ health care challeng here at home __PUNCT__
