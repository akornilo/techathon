it remind us everi dai of the precious of life and the both opportun and oblig each of us ha to do our part to advanc the caus of freedom __PUNCT__ to care for on anoth __PUNCT__ for walk our individu journei with a sens of a destin that is better for everyon __PUNCT__
and that what the naacp ha done for so mani year and now with thi __NUM__ annual freedom fund banquet __PUNCT__ it continu the tradit __PUNCT__
dot and i went over and met some of the young peopl __PUNCT__ the next gener of leader for the naacp __PUNCT__ for thi citi __PUNCT__ thi state __PUNCT__ and thi countri __PUNCT__
i want to thank everyon who understand the mission of the naacp __PUNCT__
it is a big dog __PUNCT__ but it a dog with a conscienc __PUNCT__ that an unusu combin __PUNCT__ call us to understand that __PUNCT__ as american __PUNCT__ we have to keep faith with all that came befor __PUNCT__
the naacp leadership wa evid these past few week __PUNCT__ as you call the nation attent to an exampl of present dai discrimin happen in jena __PUNCT__ louisiana __PUNCT__
and the naacp and peopl of goodwil everywher stood up and made sure their voic were heard __PUNCT__ ask tough question about the administr of justic __PUNCT__
and yesterdai an appeal court heard those voic and it took anoth look and said justic wa not done __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ there is no excus for the wai the legal system treat those young peopl __PUNCT__
thi case remind us that the scale of justic ar serious out of balanc when it come to charg __PUNCT__ sentenc and punish african american __PUNCT__
and we cannot forget thi is not over yet __PUNCT__
there ar still question unansw __PUNCT__
the case in jena cri out for a full investig by the depart of justic civil right divis __PUNCT__
and it reaffirm my convict that the next presid must have a justic depart devot to justic and a civil right divis that work for all american __PUNCT__
thi case remind us that we have so much work yet to do __PUNCT__ america long march to freedom __PUNCT__ equal and opportun ha been mark by mani mileston like the creation of the naacp __PUNCT__ or the montgomeri bu boycott __PUNCT__ the sit __PUNCT__ in at the orangeburg lunch counter organ by a young jim clyburn __PUNCT__ that fate sundai march across the petti bridg in selma __PUNCT__ alabama __PUNCT__
but these mileston do not mark the end of the journei our countri ha been on __PUNCT__
thei ar wai station along that journei __PUNCT__ the march is not over __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ america need the naacp and it leadership as much as we ever have befor __PUNCT__
i been travel across our countri __PUNCT__
i came todai to be with you from california __PUNCT__ i crisscross the countri __PUNCT__ from on coast to the other __PUNCT__ from north to south __PUNCT__ and i see the strength and the dynam of our great nation __PUNCT__
but i also hear the voic of so mani american who ar worri about our futur __PUNCT__
thei not sure of the direct we ar head and thei ask with concern and even insecur __PUNCT__ what next __PUNCT__ thei awar that we have an incom gap that ha grown like a chasm in our countri __PUNCT__
between the veri veri best off in america and all the rest of us __PUNCT__ and it a gap that is even greater between african american and white american __PUNCT__
we have a health care gap __PUNCT__
the access to health care is not even in our nation __PUNCT__ we all know that __PUNCT__
the rate for diseas and the failur to treat those diseas is a dispar that we should not toler __PUNCT__
we have an achiev gap between the rate of graduat and access to higher educ __PUNCT__ between the gleam corridor of suburban school and the deplor condit along the corridor of shame __PUNCT__
and we have an invest gap when inner citi and rural america ar left behind becaus we ar fail to invest in either the physic infrastructur or the human potenti __PUNCT__
and inde we even have a democraci gap right now in america __PUNCT__
when some american __PUNCT__ particularli peopl of color __PUNCT__ have to wait at the poll for hour while other down the road or in the next town cast their vote within minut __PUNCT__ there someth wrong __PUNCT__
and as we have seen __PUNCT__ most recent __PUNCT__ we have a justic gap __PUNCT__
reverend darbi refer to the dispar in sentenc when it come to cocain __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that is just on of the disparities.15 __PUNCT__ of drug user in america ar african american __PUNCT__ but african american make up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all drug offend sent to prison __PUNCT__
so how do we close all of these gap __PUNCT__ how do we move forward toward a more perfect union __PUNCT__ continu that progress that ha been the hallmark but we cannot let it stop now __PUNCT__
i start with my convict that our famili and commun __PUNCT__ our church and civic organ __PUNCT__ our state __PUNCT__ and our countri have to work togeth to help each child live up to hi or her god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ to me __PUNCT__ is the ralli cry for america __PUNCT__ but instead of tap that potenti and work to bring america togeth __PUNCT__ too mani american todai feel as though thei ar invis __PUNCT__ that their problem __PUNCT__ their daili struggl __PUNCT__ ar not cover in the media __PUNCT__ not the concern of peopl in public life or in the boardroom of america __PUNCT__ and inde that thei ar be forgotten instead of enlist in thi great american commit to a better futur __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ inde that what happen in the last year __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we had an attornei gener who doesn't respect the rule of law or enforc the civil right law on the book __PUNCT__
we seen suprem court justic turn the clock back on brown vs __PUNCT__ board of educ __PUNCT__
tax break have been given for drug compani ahead of health care for poor children __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ bid contract given to halliburton __PUNCT__ while more than __NUM__ peopl still live in trailer along the gulf coast __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ we have seen the creation of a govern that turn american valu on their head __PUNCT__ a govern of the few __PUNCT__ by the few __PUNCT__ and for the few __PUNCT__
it break tradit becaus __PUNCT__ for us __PUNCT__ we want to believ that our govern repres all of us __PUNCT__ don't we __PUNCT__ it taken mani year of struggl to get to that point __PUNCT__
most of us in thi room tonight were not in our constitut __PUNCT__
it took a long time befor we amend it to includ __PUNCT__ at least on paper __PUNCT__ constitut right for us all __PUNCT__
and to feel as though the clock is be turn back is unaccept in our countri __PUNCT__
thi new vision of govern that ha been propag in washington __PUNCT__ that jim clyburn and i have been fight against __PUNCT__ is call the ownership societi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the realiti is thei own it and want you to work for it __PUNCT__
you on your own is a better descript __PUNCT__
if you take the first letter of you on your own __PUNCT__ it spell yo __PUNCT__ yo __PUNCT__ and that the wai a lot of peopl feel __PUNCT__ somebodi els hold the string and move it up and down __PUNCT__
becaus if you ar a child in a crumbl school along the corridor of shame __PUNCT__ you ar invis __PUNCT__
and if you a young man caught in the brutal revolv door of low skill __PUNCT__ no job __PUNCT__ and a justic system stack against you __PUNCT__ you invis as well __PUNCT__
if you a mother without health care __PUNCT__ a father without a job __PUNCT__ a famili that can't get by on the minimum wage __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
if you a voter __PUNCT__ turn awai from the poll for no good reason or vote on a broken machin that doesn't even record your vote __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
and if you stuck on a rooftop or strand at the super dome dure a hurrican __PUNCT__ you invis to thi presid __PUNCT__ even when you on cnn __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ these peopl ar not invis to the naacp __PUNCT__ and thei not invis to me __PUNCT__ and thei should never be invis to the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
these stori and these concern should be there on a daili basi in the oval offic becaus when we invis to each other __PUNCT__ we not work togeth __PUNCT__ we not roll up our sleev and try to solv problem __PUNCT__ we not see each other or listen __PUNCT__ and we ar the poorer for it __PUNCT__
we got to get america back into the solut busi __PUNCT__
when i wa grow up __PUNCT__ i believ that my countri could do anyth we set our mind to __PUNCT__ and dure my lifetim __PUNCT__ i saw mani exampl of that __PUNCT__
i saw a suprem court come down with the decis call brown vs __PUNCT__ board of educ __PUNCT__
i saw a presid who sent in troop to make sure children could go to school in littl rock __PUNCT__ arkansa __PUNCT__
i heard a presid sai we send a man to the moon and bring him back safe befor the end of the decad __PUNCT__
i watch as a presid sign civil right law and vote right law and medicar and medicaid to care for the poor and care for the elderli __PUNCT__
republican and democrat presid alik kept move us forward __PUNCT__
we have been in the grip of a danger experi in extrem the last six and a half year __PUNCT__
it ha been __PUNCT__ it ha been a repudi of the bi __PUNCT__ partisanship that togeth ha move our countri __PUNCT__
jim quot abraham lincoln __PUNCT__ a great republican presid __PUNCT__ and you could pick mani other from both side of the aisl __PUNCT__
our current presid campaign as a compassion conserv and it turn out he wa neither __PUNCT__
and we have been pai a price __PUNCT__ and thi is not about partisanship __PUNCT__ thi is about be an american again __PUNCT__
thi is about care that our countri ha these challeng and then work to overcom them __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ all of you in charleston know how import the ongo struggl is __PUNCT__ and i know later we have a chanc to join hand and sing __PUNCT__ we shall overcom __PUNCT__
well that stori of that song speak volum about the power of work with on anoth and look out for each other __PUNCT__
sixti year ago the worker of the american tobacco compani here in charleston were on strike __PUNCT__
these women sang a song on the picket line that mani peopl had known as __PUNCT__ i be alright __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ i overcom somedai __PUNCT__
but the women of charleston sang it with a veri import differ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ thei sang __PUNCT__ we will overcom somedai __PUNCT__
and your own septima clark would later help chang the word __PUNCT__ will __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ shall __PUNCT__
and thi version echo across contin and gener __PUNCT__ out of the mouth of protest and the mouth of presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i will overcom __PUNCT__ wa a fine song but __PUNCT__ we shall overcom __PUNCT__ move mountain and chang the world and we need a presid who will make that same chang in our govern __PUNCT__ the chang from __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__
we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and it time we make govern work for all of us again __PUNCT__
it time that we make govern a true partner not just with those who ar alreadi privileg but with everi small town __PUNCT__ everi small hamlet __PUNCT__ everi group of peopl in our countri __PUNCT__
i believ that on of the most import job of the next presid is to defin a new vision of prosper and fair for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a vision for how we restor prosper for work and middl class american who ar the heart and soul of thi nation and how we can achiev the promis of our found __PUNCT__ that we ar all creat equal __PUNCT__ endow by our creator with inalien right __PUNCT__
and here what i believ __PUNCT__
the foundat of a strong economi is the invest we make in each other __PUNCT__ in educ __PUNCT__ in health care __PUNCT__ in job and hous __PUNCT__
sarah ford talk about the problem we have across america and the veri great difficulti peopl ar face becaus of the mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
we have so mani middl class peopl who ar hang on and so mani who us to be in the middl class fall back into poverti __PUNCT__
dure the 1990 we saw the creation of twenti two million new job and more peopl lift out of poverti than at ani time in our countri histori __PUNCT__
last month we lost four thousand job in america and peopl ar justifi concern about what will happen to their home __PUNCT__ their health care __PUNCT__ their job __PUNCT__ their futur __PUNCT__
great ha come in america from our recognit that it is not rich peopl who made america great __PUNCT__ it is the hardwork middl class and work peopl who made america great and continu to make us great __PUNCT__
we got to get back to creat good job with rise wage and i convinc we can do that __PUNCT__
we have to move back to fiscal respons __PUNCT__
six and a half year ago we had a balanc budget and a surplu __PUNCT__
that ha been squander __PUNCT__
the presid ha had two major goal of hi presid __PUNCT__ tax break for the wealthiest and the war in iraq __PUNCT__
but he ha not paid for either __PUNCT__
he put them on the credit card __PUNCT__
the wai he fund them is to borrow monei from the social secur trust fund and borrow monei from countri like china everi singl dai __PUNCT__
so we ar in __PUNCT__ hoc __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__
we borrow monei even from mexico __PUNCT__
we need to get back to a sens of respons in the feder govern and then we got to look at how we go to creat new job by a new energi plan that put peopl to work in america by go ahead and combat global warm right here at home __PUNCT__ someth import for coastal state like south carolina __PUNCT__
we need to rebuild our infrastructur and i think that if we had a job program base no energi __PUNCT__ the environ __PUNCT__ and infrastructur __PUNCT__ we would put million of american back to work again __PUNCT__
we need to provid a high qualiti educ for everi singl child __PUNCT__ and i want to have a univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten program that is especi focus on children from disadvantag background __PUNCT__ i heard the mayor talk about that __PUNCT__
we know that if children get a good qualiti pre __PUNCT__ school educ __PUNCT__ thei stai in school __PUNCT__ thei do better __PUNCT__ and the evid is overwhelm that with a good qualiti pre __PUNCT__ school program in our countri we would cut by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the achiev gap between black and white youngster by the time thei graduat from high school __PUNCT__
we got to make colleg afford again and i want to brag on the democrat congress particularli with our leader here __PUNCT__ leader clyburn __PUNCT__ the democrat congress ha just pass legisl to lower interest rate and increas the amount of pell grant so we can get back to make colleg afford again __PUNCT__
and let not forget all of the decent young peopl who don't go to colleg __PUNCT__
let get more apprenticeship program __PUNCT__ more technic program __PUNCT__ thei deserv our help to have a job that make them competit in the global economi __PUNCT__
i believ we can guarante everi singl american qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care __PUNCT__
it is time __PUNCT__
we have __NUM__ million american without health insur __PUNCT__
but it not just about insur the uninsur although i believ that is a moral imper __PUNCT__
in some group that i speak to some peopl come up to me afterward and thei sai __PUNCT__ i don't know anyon that uninsur __PUNCT__
i sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ go to an emerg room some night and sit in that emerg room and watch peopl come in becaus thei have no where els to go __PUNCT__
so it is a moral imper that we come up with a health care plan to cover everyon __PUNCT__ but it not onli that __PUNCT__ we have to make sure that the peopl with insur actual get taken care of becaus too mani peopl with insur when their doctor sai thei need a certain treatment __PUNCT__ the insur compani sai no __PUNCT__
i have thi problem all the time as a senat __PUNCT__
a man from northern new york call me and said __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ what have i done wrong __PUNCT__ i work for the same employ for year __PUNCT__
i alwai paid my premium __PUNCT__
my famili ha alwai been healthi __PUNCT__
now my son ha been diagnos with a rare diseas and the doctor sai there on place in the countri where he should be treat and the insur compani sai thei won't send him there __PUNCT__
or a mother from long island __PUNCT__ ny call and sai her daughter ha leukemia and she need a stem cell transplant but thei have to have a donor and it expens to search for a donor and the insur compani won't pai for the search __PUNCT__
so i get on the phone and my staff get on the phone and we argu with the insur compani and thei afraid that we embarrass them and so final thei sai __PUNCT__ fine __PUNCT__ the boi can have hi oper and we pai for the donor search __PUNCT__
it should not take a unit state senat to get the health care that a mother and a father need for their son and daughter __PUNCT__
on mondai i be releas the third part of my health care plan __PUNCT__ the first part is lower cost for everybodi __PUNCT__
premium cost have gone up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ in the last six year __PUNCT__ more and more employ can't afford to cover peopl __PUNCT__
insur is get more bare bone __PUNCT__ so let get cost down and let improv qualiti and that includ emphas prevent __PUNCT__
as dot and i were walk in __PUNCT__ there a poster outsid that sai __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of south carolinian have heart diseas __PUNCT__
we stop and star at it __PUNCT__
i wa shock at that high figur __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__
we got to do more to help peopl keep themselv healthi __PUNCT__
we don't pai for prevent in america __PUNCT__
if you ar diabet __PUNCT__ a lot of insur compani won't pai for you to have your feet check or your ey check but if you have to have your foot amput __PUNCT__ thei pai for the oper __PUNCT__
that just upsid down and backward __PUNCT__
so we got to get to a point where we ar pai for prevent and then we have to cover everybodi __PUNCT__
i think the time ha come becaus doctor __PUNCT__ nurs __PUNCT__ hospit __PUNCT__ employ __PUNCT__ labor __PUNCT__ everybodi realiz we ar lose job in the global economi becaus we don't have the health care system that can effect deliv health care with high valu at lower cost __PUNCT__
but then we also have to restor compet to our govern __PUNCT__
now i never thought that would be an applaus line that you stand up and sai __PUNCT__ we got to get our govern to be compet __PUNCT__ but after katrina __PUNCT__
we have to end the no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ we have to get rid of the cronyism in govern and we have to get back to an old fashion idea of appoint qualifi peopl to the posit thei hold in the unit state govern __PUNCT__
in particular __PUNCT__ we got to have a justic depart that function again __PUNCT__
todai i releas my agenda to restor and strengthen the civil right mission of the depart of justic __PUNCT__
it is a five __PUNCT__ point plan that will meet the challeng of thi time __PUNCT__
the first is to begin undo the damag of the past year __PUNCT__
i want an attornei gener who will conduct a thorough review and report back with recommend on how to restor the depart tradit role in enforc civil right and respect the rule of law __PUNCT__
the attornei gener should also review charg of improp __PUNCT__ polit motiv hire and fire to determin whether law have been broken __PUNCT__
rememb it wa republican u. attornei who realli sound the alarm about all the partisan activ go on in the justic depart __PUNCT__
we cannot have that __PUNCT__ ladi and gentleman __PUNCT__
we have to believ that justic is blind in america __PUNCT__
and we have to fulli fund the civil right divis __PUNCT__
we got to get back to allow local commun to look for wai to pursu integr and reduc racial inequ __PUNCT__
the court action in it recent case wa a big setback to voluntari effort that local commun had adopt themselv __PUNCT__ nobodi order them to __PUNCT__ thei decid what thei want to do __PUNCT__
and we got to give some monei and expertis to local commun to help them figur out how best to fulfil the mean of the equal protect claus __PUNCT__
i want to lead a great effort to fight discrimin in the workplac __PUNCT__
a recent studi found a shock fact __PUNCT__
employ were twice as like to hire a white applic with the veri same qualif as a black applic __PUNCT__
and even hire at a greater percentag __PUNCT__ white applic with crimin record over black applic without on __PUNCT__
anyon who sai that we have gotten beyond racial discrimin is not live with their ey open __PUNCT__
i believ we have to shine a bright light on ani discrimin __PUNCT__ whether it be against peopl of color or against women and make sure that we truli fulfil our law __PUNCT__ not just by the letter but by the spirit __PUNCT__
i also want to clean up our elect and i have introduc legisl to do that and we attempt to get a bill through the congress __PUNCT__
we have to prosecut and punish decept practic __PUNCT__ you heard about them __PUNCT__
peopl come out of church and there a flier on the window __PUNCT__ under the windshield wiper and it sai you suppos to vote on wednesdai not tuesdai __PUNCT__
or peopl pick up the phone and a voic sai __PUNCT__ we just call to inform you that if you ever even had a traffic ticket you cannot vote __PUNCT__
all kind of decept practic __PUNCT__
and then we got the new challeng of the identif requir __PUNCT__ which ar in mani respect __PUNCT__ discrimin against the poor __PUNCT__ the elderli __PUNCT__
i see that in new york __PUNCT__ in new york citi we have a lot of peopl that don't have a driver licens becaus thei take the subwai and now in order to be abl to vote thei have to produc someth like a driver licens __PUNCT__
so we got to make sure that we ar not disenfranchis american after have spent fifti year try to extend the franchis to everi singl american __PUNCT__
i would also like to see us modern and strengthen our law against hate crime and gener reassert our belief that we ar stronger when we respect and protect the right of everi singl on of us __PUNCT__
and of cours we must begin to end the war in iraq and bring our troop home as quickli and respons as we can __PUNCT__
the realiti is thi is a sectarian civil war __PUNCT__ there is no militari solut __PUNCT__
our young men and women who wear the uniform of our countri have perform heroic and with great honor and dedic and thei have done what thei were ask to do __PUNCT__
thei were given a mission and thei have fulfil it __PUNCT__
thei were ask to get rid of saddam hussein and bring him to justic and thei did __PUNCT__
thei were ask to give the iraqi a chanc for free and fair elect and thei did as well and thei were ask to give the iraqi govern the space and time to make the polit decis that onli the iraqi can make for themselv __PUNCT__
so their mission ha been complet __PUNCT__
unfortun neither the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ nor our govern __PUNCT__ have done what thei need to do polit and diplomat to deal with the challeng in iraq __PUNCT__
the peopl vote for chang in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we have been fight for chang in the congress __PUNCT__
and i hope that the presid will work with us to start bring our troop home __PUNCT__ engag in a veri concert effort to get the iraqi to make the tough decis thei have to make and start a diplomat process in the region and the world to try to bring more countri into the effort to stabil iraq go forward __PUNCT__
but if the presid doe not end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ then the next presid must __PUNCT__
that ha to be part of what happen as soon as possibl __PUNCT__
so i believ that america is readi for chang and it chang that is part of the american charact and experi __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we believ in chang __PUNCT__
we ar the peopl of the futur __PUNCT__
when you travel around the world as i been privileg to do __PUNCT__ it strike how own in place near and far __PUNCT__ thei ar look backward not forward __PUNCT__
when i wa first ladi and i would repres our countri and i would go to meet with presid and prime minist and other dignitari __PUNCT__ often just as an ic breaker __PUNCT__ i would sai __PUNCT__ so how ar thing go here in whatev countri i wa in __PUNCT__
i cannot tell you how mani time peopl start their answer by talk about someth that happen __NUM__ or __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ well thing ar fine except __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ if it hadn't been for that war __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ thing would be a lot better __PUNCT__
we ar the peopl of the futur and we need to start act like that again __PUNCT__
there is no problem we face in the world that we cannot meet __PUNCT__
if we decid as american we will do that __PUNCT__
you cannot be a leader if no on is follow and right now our countri ha to rebuild our stand and posit in the world becaus there is no problem we face whether it be global terror or global warm or global epidem that we can take on by ourselv __PUNCT__
so it import that we give back so that feel of confid and optim that ha mark our countri over these long centuri of progress and hope __PUNCT__
when jim wa talk about my own life __PUNCT__ i did start out as a young lawyer work for a nativ south carolinian __PUNCT__ marion wright edelman at the children defens fund and i rememb be so struck by how dedic she and everyon work with her were to make it possibl to chang live on at a time __PUNCT__
i went door to door find children who weren't in school becaus in those dai __PUNCT__ so mani children were kept out of school if thei had minor disabl __PUNCT__ if the had to take care of their sibl __PUNCT__
and that wa onli __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
we had million of children who weren't even go to school __PUNCT__
and then we pass the individu with disabl in educ act and we began to reach out to everi singl child __PUNCT__
that what i believ we do at our best __PUNCT__
we reach out to on anoth __PUNCT__
and i go to do everyth i can __PUNCT__ work with you to make the chang happen that america is yearn for __PUNCT__
i know it not easi __PUNCT__
there ar lot of reason why peopl would stop try to get health care for everyon or try to get a new energi polici that took the tax break awai from the oil compani __PUNCT__
if it were easi __PUNCT__ anyon would do it __PUNCT__
we do it becaus we ar american __PUNCT__
we can't let ourselv be stop by the partisan bicker or the divis or the enorm of the challeng we face __PUNCT__
there ar those who will sai it can't be done __PUNCT__
there alwai ar __PUNCT__
but as jame baldwin onc note __PUNCT__ those who sai it can't be done ar usual interrupt by other do it __PUNCT__
for nearli __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ the naacp ha been interrupt the nai __PUNCT__ sayer __PUNCT__ chang law and chang live __PUNCT__
that why i honor to be with you tonight and i honor to walk alongsid you in the march for justic __PUNCT__
i look forward to continu that march in the month and year ahead __PUNCT__
becaus it lead to the destin that is america destini __PUNCT__ that more perfect union __PUNCT__ that place where not onli we look at on anoth and recogn those inalien right __PUNCT__ but we work to make sure that everi singl child ha a chanc to live up to hi or her god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
and that america good and great is recogn across the world __PUNCT__
thank you all and god bless you __PUNCT__
