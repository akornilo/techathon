it wa built by the peopl of thi state who __PUNCT__ even __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ understood that to compet in todai economi __PUNCT__ young peopl need the skill for todai job __PUNCT__
that what we alwai done here in america __PUNCT__ when our economi chang __PUNCT__ we don't panic or give up or wring our hand __PUNCT__ we simpli chang with it __PUNCT__
that what ha happen here at mst __PUNCT__
i realli applaud you for do that __PUNCT__ becaus we have to look for exampl like thi to figur out what we need to do more broadli across our nation __PUNCT__
now we done thi befor __PUNCT__
we did the same thing back at the turn of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ the american economi wa domin by larg corpor monopoli __PUNCT__
corrupt wa far too common and good govern far too rare __PUNCT__
women couldn't vote __PUNCT__ and the minimum wage __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that wasn't heard of and worker right were complet unimagin __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ america wa a countri fill with have and have not __PUNCT__ and not enough peopl in between __PUNCT__
in respons to these excess __PUNCT__ the progress movement wa born __PUNCT__
throughout the late 1800 and earli 1900 __PUNCT__ the progress bust trust and fought for safe work condit and fair wage __PUNCT__
thei creat the nation park system __PUNCT__ and replac a govern rife with cronyism with a merit __PUNCT__ base civil servic __PUNCT__
thei understood __PUNCT__ as the great progress presid teddi roosevelt onc said __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ the welfar of each of us is depend fundament upon the welfar of all of us __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ at the begin of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ i think it time we rememb those lesson __PUNCT__
for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ we have a truli global economi __PUNCT__
worker todai think noth of hold teleconfer with colleagu on three contin at onc or e __PUNCT__ mail busi partner across the globe __PUNCT__
compani also think noth of ship our job __PUNCT__ even entir factori __PUNCT__ oversea __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ competit no longer stop at the water edg __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ for mani of our compani __PUNCT__ that where it start __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ new hampshir provid __MONEY__ billion worth of export to __NUM__ countri a year __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ technolog is plai an increasingli import role __PUNCT__
it realli revolution how we live and work __PUNCT__
we see u. __PUNCT__ telemarket job done in remot locat far __PUNCT__ far from our shore __PUNCT__
manufactur requir fewer job as machin replac peopl both here in america and around the world __PUNCT__
in part becaus india and china have begun to har the power of technolog __PUNCT__ thei ar on their wai to becom econom super power __PUNCT__
like it or not __PUNCT__ that is the realiti of global __PUNCT__
and it isn't go awai __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ if manag properli __PUNCT__ global mai offer the promis of new market __PUNCT__ new growth __PUNCT__ and new opportun for broadli share prosper to young peopl like colleen __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we not manag global properli __PUNCT__
instead of work for all of us __PUNCT__ global is work onli for a few of us __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it is work for corpor __PUNCT__
corpor profit have grown an averag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ a year sinc __NUM__ adjust for inflat __PUNCT__
it work for ceo who seen their pai go from __NUM__ time the typic worker in __NUM__ to __NUM__ time the typic worker in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and it work for american with incom at the veri top __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ all incom gain went to the top __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of household __PUNCT__ while the bottom __NUM__ __PUNCT__ saw their incom declin __PUNCT__ in spite of the fact that worker product ha increas for six year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in past econom expans __PUNCT__ that not the wai it wa __PUNCT__
in the past __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of net corpor revenu have gone to employe compens __PUNCT__ and onli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to profit __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ for the past five year __PUNCT__ the compar figur ar __NUM__ __PUNCT__ go to employe compens and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ go to profit __PUNCT__
think about thi __PUNCT__ last year __PUNCT__ the share of america nation incom go to corpor profit wa the highest sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__ while the share go to the salari of american worker wa the lowest __PUNCT__
the inescap realiti is that global __PUNCT__ modern technolog __PUNCT__ econom polici __PUNCT__ ar creat new condit that threaten our middl class famili and make it harder to maintain a middl class lifestyl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ dure the second half of the 1990 __PUNCT__ product growth led to rise incom across the board __PUNCT__
but over the past six year __PUNCT__ while product ha gone up __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that mean american ar work harder than ever and __PUNCT__ by most indic __PUNCT__ work harder than anybodi els in the rest of the world __PUNCT__ famili incom have gone down __MONEY__
the global labor market mai even be depress wage for skill and profession job __PUNCT__
sinc __NUM__ new job creat in america pai __PUNCT__ on averag __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent less than the job we have lost __PUNCT__
and back in __NUM__ child poverti wa the lowest it had been in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
sinc then it ha risen by __NUM__ million __PUNCT__
and todai we have __NUM__ million children live in poverti __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ given these realiti __PUNCT__ it unsurpris we see rise inequ and rise pessim in our workforc __PUNCT__
todai more than __NUM__ percent of american believ that our manufactur job ar at risk of be outsourc __PUNCT__
and let be clear __PUNCT__
it not as if america hasn't been success econom the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
but the measur of success doesn't relat what happen in household across our countri __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ while product and corpor profit ar up __PUNCT__ the fruit of that success just hasn't reach mani of our famili __PUNCT__
it like trickl __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ but without the trickl __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ the gap between those who ar enjoi the fruit of the modern economi and those who aren't is grow wider __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ the top __NUM__ percent of household held roughli __NUM__ percent of our nation incom __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ thei held __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the highest level sinc __NUM__ a year that isn't exactli on of our best year in american histori __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ our founder knew that inequ wasn't good for our countri __PUNCT__
thei believ that vast concentr of wealth were a threat to democraci __PUNCT__
thei believ america should give everyon __PUNCT__ not just the children of the land gentri __PUNCT__ the chanc to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ that ideal is at risk __PUNCT__
we ar in danger of lose that uniqu american engin of opportun that ha creat so much wealth and spread it so wide __PUNCT__
believ it or not __PUNCT__ todai in some part of europ there is more social mobil than right here in america __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ now we haven't heard much from washington in the past six year about how to solv thi grow problem of inequ __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the tax __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ trade and budget polici of the administr and it alli in congress have made the problem wors __PUNCT__
i believ peopl ar fed up with the polici of the past six year __PUNCT__
so mani peopl i talk to just want to hit the restart button on the __NUM__ centuri and redo it the right wai __PUNCT__
and i agre with them __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ we start the decad with rise incom __PUNCT__ declin inequ __PUNCT__ robust job growth and a surplu in our feder budget __PUNCT__
instead of build on polici that work __PUNCT__ the washington republican revers them with predict but intoler consequ __PUNCT__
i believ that on of the most crucial job of the next presid is to defin a new vision of econom fair and prosper for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a vision for how we ensur greater opportun for our next gener __PUNCT__ and then to outlin a strategi and then to implement it __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i believ we need a new progress vision for thi new centuri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i consid myself a thoroughli optimist and modern progress __PUNCT__
i believ we can grow our economi in the face of global competit __PUNCT__ and in a wai that benefit all american __PUNCT__
i believ we can curb the excess of the marketplac and provid more opportun for more american to succe __PUNCT__
i believ we can support and promot smart trade polici that truli enforc strong labor and environment standard __PUNCT__
i believ we can help more worker join union to improv wage and condit in our workplac for job that cannot be ship oversea __PUNCT__
i believ that __PUNCT__ just as __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri progress fought corrupt with a new civil servic __PUNCT__ we can restor compet to the front line of our govern and ensur that we never __PUNCT__ ever experi anoth hurrican katrina __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ i believ that our govern can onc again work for all american __PUNCT__
it can promot the great american tradit of opportun for all and special privileg for none __PUNCT__
todai i want to focu on how we ensur both strong econom growth and econom fair __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we have seen for more than a centuri that fair doesn't just happen __PUNCT__
it requir the right govern polici __PUNCT__
and no on should be surpris __PUNCT__ human natur be what it is __PUNCT__ peopl will go as far as thei possibl can get awai with __PUNCT__
the geniu of the american econom in the __NUM__ centuri wa that it help to counter that tendenc for peopl to push as far as their own interest would take them so that we creat a level plai field that benefit everyon __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ for the past six year it as though we gone back to the era of the robber baron __PUNCT__
year after year the presid ha hand out massiv tax break to oil compani __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ bid contract to halliburton __PUNCT__ tax incent to corpor ship job oversea __PUNCT__ tax cut after tax cut to multimillionair __PUNCT__ while ignor the need and aspir of ten of million of work famili __PUNCT__
and how ha he paid for all of thi largess __PUNCT__ by run up record deficit __PUNCT__
he ha simpli charg it to our nation credit card and left our children and grandchildren to pai the bill __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ everi babi born todai start like with __MONEY__ of nation debt on hi or her tini shoulder __PUNCT__ the largest birth tax in our nation histori __PUNCT__
it also import to understand these polici ar consist with the administr theori about how we should manag our economi __PUNCT__ leav it all up to the individu __PUNCT__
that why thei want to privat social secur and let individu bear the risk __PUNCT__
it why their answer to the health care crisi is limit to creat health save account __PUNCT__ which allow the healthiest peopl to get the best deal __PUNCT__ with littl concern if the sickest get wors __PUNCT__
thei call it the ownership societi __PUNCT__
but it realli the __PUNCT__ on your own __PUNCT__ societi __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ thei protect the drug compani from competit __PUNCT__ includ from their own product come back across the border from canada __PUNCT__
and thei give health care compani a subsidi of more than __MONEY__ per person to compet with medicar __PUNCT__
that is hardli the free market at work __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ too mani of our famili ar left run in place or fall behind __PUNCT__
health care premium have gone up __NUM__ percent sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__ colleg cost up __NUM__ percent sinc the __NUM__ school year __PUNCT__
ga price have more than doubl __PUNCT__
and i don't need to tell anyon that thei head even higher todai __PUNCT__
wage and incom ar lag so much that __PUNCT__ after five year of overal growth __PUNCT__ there been a __NUM__ percent increas in the percentag of worker fall below the poverti line __PUNCT__ and a __NUM__ percent increas in work famili lose their health insur __PUNCT__
it like our middl __PUNCT__ class and hardwork famili ar invis to thi presid __PUNCT__
if you a worker who can't organ for fair wage and safe work condit __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you on of the over __NUM__ million american who don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
if your compani ha ship your job oversea and you don't know how to pai your bill __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you drive up to the ga station and have to pai well over __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ a gallon to fill up your tank __PUNCT__ you invis as well __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you not invis to me __PUNCT__
and we can't restor the american dream unless you a veri visibl part of it __PUNCT__
it time for a new begin __PUNCT__ for an end to govern of the few __PUNCT__ by the few and for the few __PUNCT__ time to reject the idea of an __PUNCT__ on your own __PUNCT__ societi and to replac it with share respons for share prosper __PUNCT__
i prefer a __PUNCT__ we all in it togeth __PUNCT__ societi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there is no greater forc for econom growth than free market __PUNCT__ but market work best with rule that promot our valu __PUNCT__ protect our worker and give all peopl a chanc to succe __PUNCT__
when we get our prioriti in order and make the smart invest we need __PUNCT__ the market work well __PUNCT__
some of you might rememb that __PUNCT__ while we began the 1990 with record deficit __PUNCT__ we end the decad with a balanc budget __PUNCT__ a record surplu __PUNCT__ higher wage for the middl class __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ we can't simpli recycl the polici that work in the 1990 __PUNCT__
these ar differ time __PUNCT__
but we can return to mani of the principl that guid us then __PUNCT__ the principl that have work time and time again to build our economi __PUNCT__ expand opportun __PUNCT__ and offer all american the chanc to have that american dream which we promis __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i the product of thi chanc __PUNCT__
i grew up in a middl __PUNCT__ class famili in the middl of america in the middl of the last centuri __PUNCT__
my father came back from world war ii after have serv in the navi __PUNCT__ and he work hard to build hi small busi __PUNCT__
he believ that on should avoid be in debt at all cost __PUNCT__ and instil in me the import of be respons with a budget at an earli ag __PUNCT__ a valu i still hold dear todai __PUNCT__
like million of other famili __PUNCT__ we work hard __PUNCT__ we save and we invest __PUNCT__
and togeth __PUNCT__ our determin and work ethic help to creat the american middl class __PUNCT__
now that middl class is under assault from global econom forc and wronghead econom polici __PUNCT__
so i propos a new progress plan to restor that american dream and to give all american the chanc to compet and prosper in the global economi __PUNCT__
here what i believ we should do __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i go to work to level the plai field and reduc the special break for big corpor __PUNCT__
we sai thi in everi campaign __PUNCT__
we make a littl bit of progress __PUNCT__
and then unfortun __PUNCT__ when the republican get back in offic __PUNCT__ thei revers everyth we done and add to the corpor welfar __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think we go to have a better shot thi time becaus we go to make it an issu in thi campaign __PUNCT__
we go to ask peopl who ar run for congress to sign up on wai or the other __PUNCT__ ar thei for corpor welfar __PUNCT__ or ar thei for the averag american have a decent shot at the american dream __PUNCT__ and there a lot we could do right now __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i believ that if we did give medicar the chanc to negoti with drug compani __PUNCT__ we would save __MONEY__ billion to __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
why should the drug compani be immun from the process that goe on everi dai in america __PUNCT__ where you bargain for the best deal you can get __PUNCT__ and we need to give our govern that opportun to do so __PUNCT__
when bill wa presid __PUNCT__ he gave it to the v.a __PUNCT__ which is on of the reason why the v.a __PUNCT__ ha the lowest drug price in america todai __PUNCT__
bargain realli doe make a differ __PUNCT__
we also need to requir the big oil compani that ar make the largest profit in the histori of the world to invest in altern energi themselv or pai into a fund to spur clean energi research and develop __PUNCT__
and there ar mani other exampl that we could all give about how to zero in on corpor welfar __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ let onc and for all get rid of the incent for american compani to ship job and profit oversea __PUNCT__
it is on thing for the marketplac to encourag oversea invest __PUNCT__
it anoth for our own tax code to do so __PUNCT__
but that exactli what is happen __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ american compani that ship job oversea don't have to pai a penni in american tax on the profit thei make abroad unless thei bring those profit back to the unit state __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ thei don't bring them back becaus thei don't want to pai tax on them __PUNCT__
it estim thi polici cost us billion of dollar each year in lost tax revenu __PUNCT__
even wors __PUNCT__ we actual put compani that want to creat job here on our shore at a disadvantag to those who ship job to tax haven __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when i presid we go to reward decis to creat job here at home __PUNCT__
we will consid elimin the deduct for the actual cost of move job __PUNCT__
these ar decis that __PUNCT__ if there go to be a level plai field __PUNCT__ there should be no advantag given to anyon who take a job and send it oversea at the disadvantag of our workforc __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ let reform the govern of our corpor and our financi sector __PUNCT__
if you have ani doubt about whether corpor govern impact ordinari american __PUNCT__ just think back to what happen at enron __PUNCT__ where thousand of worker lost much of their retir save __PUNCT__
the wai i see it __PUNCT__ allow ceo to escap with golden parachut while their compani abandon worker __PUNCT__ pension doe not honor our valu __PUNCT__
we need to open up ceo compens to public scrutini and public challeng and ensur that board of director ar independ when determin ceo pai __PUNCT__
and we need to updat our regul to confront the emerg problem in our sub __PUNCT__ prime and privat equiti market __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ let restor fiscal respons to our govern __PUNCT__
let get back to balanc budget and save social secur instead of run up our deficit __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ peopl ask me all the time __PUNCT__ why can't we get tough on china __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the answer is __PUNCT__ becaus china is on of our banker __PUNCT__
we their debtor __PUNCT__
how can we truli enforc trade law against a countri that manipul it currenc and put us at an unfair advantag when our econom stabil depend on china massiv loan to us everi singl dai __PUNCT__ and when the presid irrespons tax break for high __PUNCT__ incom american expir __PUNCT__ we will return to the incom tax rate for upper __PUNCT__ incom american that we had in the 1990 __PUNCT__ rate that were consist with a balanc budget and econom growth __PUNCT__
for middl __PUNCT__ class american __PUNCT__ who haven't seen their paycheck increas __PUNCT__ let keep the middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut and reform the altern minimum tax in order to give middl __PUNCT__ class american the tax relief thei deserv to have __PUNCT__
and let take a hard look at corpor tax reform __PUNCT__
it simpli not fair that as corpor profit have skyrocket __PUNCT__ the percentag of tax paid by corpor have fallen __PUNCT__
it time we restor the balanc and requir corpor to pai their fair share __PUNCT__
under the law __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ thei ar citizen of the unit state __PUNCT__ with mani of the respons __PUNCT__ i would argu __PUNCT__ that goe with citizenship __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ let recommit ourselv to the idea that everi young person in america who want to should have the opportun to attend colleg __PUNCT__ and that a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri educ start earli in life and continu well into adulthood __PUNCT__
we know that have the most skill __PUNCT__ educ workforc in the world is kei to our futur success __PUNCT__
that start at the veri begin __PUNCT__ with access to univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ qualiti learn opportun for everi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old in america __PUNCT__
and i laid out a propos that would do exactli that __PUNCT__
we know that pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten keep kid in school longer __PUNCT__ keep them out of troubl __PUNCT__ give them more incent to be academ interest and that it is a good payoff for our countri __PUNCT__ for everi dollar invest __PUNCT__ we get a __MONEY__ return __PUNCT__
the altern is to pai cost in other wai __PUNCT__
a startl fact is that some state in our countri __PUNCT__ when thei plan how mani prison bed thei need __PUNCT__ look at third __PUNCT__ grade test score __PUNCT__
and thei extrapol from the number of children who ar fail in third __PUNCT__ grade read as to how mani prison bed thei need __PUNCT__
that a lot more expens than provid pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten to those same children to hopefulli keep them out of our prison __PUNCT__
we also have to do more to rais up the opportun for young peopl from middl __PUNCT__ class and work famili and poor famili to be abl to go to colleg __PUNCT__
seventi __PUNCT__ five percent of student at america elit colleg come from the top __NUM__ percent of the incom bracket __PUNCT__ just __NUM__ percent from the bottom __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
we got to make colleg afford again __PUNCT__ and that mean everyth from increas pell grant to chang the wai colleg loan ar provid and clean up the colleg loan industri from all of the scandal that is beset it __PUNCT__
becaus if we don't make colleg afford __PUNCT__ we ar see the result __PUNCT__ young peopl can't go __PUNCT__
the last time i wa in manchest i wa talk with some of the teacher from on of the high school here who told me that mani young peopl were just realli confus becaus thei didn't have the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ and thei didn't know what thei were go to do __PUNCT__
so we got to do a better job than that __PUNCT__
sixth __PUNCT__ for those who don't attend four __PUNCT__ year colleg and those in the workforc who need to updat their skill __PUNCT__ let provid more support for school like thi and for commun colleg that prepar peopl for good __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__
and let provid wage insur for our worker so that if you lose your job becaus of our trade polici __PUNCT__ you can get the train and support you need for a new and better job __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of job in our countri that ar go beg becaus we don't have the peopl with the skill to be abl to fill those job __PUNCT__
two exampl __PUNCT__
we will need __NUM__ automot mechan everi year from now until __NUM__ __PUNCT__
automot retail todai report that we have __NUM__ vacanc for mechan right now __PUNCT__
these job pai salari up to __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and employ ar aggress recruit talent high school graduat to fill these posit __PUNCT__
i met recent with the machinist union __PUNCT__
thei were tell me the same thing about airlin mechan __PUNCT__
thei have hundr of good job thei can't fill __PUNCT__
it not just that we can't fill these job __PUNCT__ it that we come to a point in our societi where __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ we don't have the respect that that these job should demand __PUNCT__
thi is someth i feel veri strongli about __PUNCT__
we have sent a messag to our young peopl that if you don't go to colleg and you don't have a high pai job __PUNCT__ someth like a basketbal player or an entertain __PUNCT__ or mayb someon in a corpor __PUNCT__ that you thought less of in america __PUNCT__
we have to stop thi __PUNCT__
our countri cannot run without the peopl who do the skill that ar taught in thi school __PUNCT__
and it is time we begin to revers the attitud that i think for too long ha prevail __PUNCT__ which is why i so pleas that governor lynch will be ad to the monei avail through the state for technolog and other kind of advanc degre learn that can give young peopl a belief that do these job is import __PUNCT__
as senat __PUNCT__ i champion region skill allianc that support employ in the same geograph region and industri __PUNCT__
thei support employ who pool their resourc and broaden opportun so that employe can get the train thei need in todai economi __PUNCT__
i think we need more program like thi __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ we go to creat more program like thi so that our worker will have the skill thei need for the job thei deserv __PUNCT__
those __NUM__ peopl who come at night __PUNCT__ that what thei do __PUNCT__
thei try to get addit skill that will enabl them to fill job that alreadi exist in thi region __PUNCT__
and we go to creat more job and more region skill allianc when i presid __PUNCT__
seventh __PUNCT__ let ensur that peopl who work hard everi dai can support their famili and save for the futur __PUNCT__
i do not believ anyon who work full __PUNCT__ time in america should draw a wage that put that person below the poverti line __PUNCT__
if you ar a full time worker you should make more than poverti __PUNCT__
now that we final reach the minimum wage __PUNCT__ let expand and simplifi the earn incom tax credit so no on work full time live in poverti __PUNCT__
let also final overhaul our unemploy insur program __PUNCT__
todai unemploy benefit aren't even enough to keep an averag famili abov the poverti line __PUNCT__
and mani worker in todai economi __PUNCT__ includ part time and self __PUNCT__ emploi worker __PUNCT__ ar still inelig for unemploy insur __PUNCT__
our unemploy system ha hardli chang at all over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and yet we know a lot of employ don't want to give peopl full time job __PUNCT__
thei onli give them part time job so thei don't have to pai for benefit __PUNCT__
so when someon is laid off or lose that part time job __PUNCT__ under our exist system even though it wa all thei could get __PUNCT__ thei not elig for unemploy insur help __PUNCT__
so i hope that we can do a better job by look at our unemploy system and bring it into the modern ag __PUNCT__
i think we also have to have a modern attitud toward union __PUNCT__
we know that union worker make __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more than worker who aren't in union __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our workplac in the privat sector is union __PUNCT__
we need to give worker more of the benefit that come with union membership __PUNCT__
let pass the employe free choic act to make sure our union can organ for fair wage and safe work condit __PUNCT__
let appoint peopl to the depart of labor who ar truli pro __PUNCT__ labor __PUNCT__
that would be an unusu idea __PUNCT__ don't you think __PUNCT__ union plai a critic role in build the middl class __PUNCT__ and i don't think it a coincid that as union membership ha drop __PUNCT__ middl class incom have stagnat __PUNCT__
so thi is not an either __PUNCT__ or choic __PUNCT__ we can have both __PUNCT__
some peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if you have more union that would make america uncompetit __PUNCT__ but there ar other countri in the global economi that pai wage equal to or higher than our __PUNCT__ and mani job that ar import to the economi in those countri demand a realli good live wage for a middl class famili __PUNCT__
their lower __PUNCT__ paid worker ar paid more than our lower __PUNCT__ paid worker __PUNCT__ but their higher paid worker ar paid less __PUNCT__
so there less of a gap between our lower paid worker and our highest paid worker which mean that there more monei for those wage increas in the middl __PUNCT__
that what work for america until rel recent __PUNCT__ and that what we have to persuad peopl is good for america again __PUNCT__
