couric __PUNCT__ so let me start by by ask you __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ you dismiss opposit to your tax ga holidai by economist as elitist __PUNCT__ but a new cb poll find that about half of all voter also think it a bad idea __PUNCT__
and mani think it polit motiv __PUNCT__
do you think thi propos will end up hurt you more than help you __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ not at all __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl don't understand that i not propos that we don't replac the revenu that would be lost __PUNCT__
that senat mccain posit __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i sai we should make the oil compani pai the ga tax thi summer out of their record profit so that we don't make the deficit bigger __PUNCT__
we don't deplet the highwai trust fund __PUNCT__
but all across indiana and north carolina peopl ar respond becaus thei live with it __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thei look at their own econom situat __PUNCT__ thei their person economist __PUNCT__ and thei sai __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we just can't deal with thi __PUNCT__
if thei trucker __PUNCT__ if thei commut long distanc __PUNCT__ if thei have to us their truck or their vehicl for their job __PUNCT__ like farmer do __PUNCT__ it realli a burden __PUNCT__
and there is no contradict between provid immedi relief by try to give folk __PUNCT__ on averag __PUNCT__ it would be __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ for a lot of peopl it would be a lot more __PUNCT__ becaus thei drive more __PUNCT__ while at the same time we try to get a presid who actual go to declar energi independ and start us on a path to get off our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl sai it would be a lot less monei than __MONEY__ for those three month __PUNCT__ and senat obama said earlier todai your plan a gimmick __PUNCT__
it phoni __PUNCT__ and rather than help consum it will just lead oil compani to rais price __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ it would never pass in congress __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ i think we gotta start go after the oil compani __PUNCT__
senat obama support a ga tax holidai without pai for it three time when he wa in the state senat __PUNCT__
so i realli focus on what we can do to give peopl immedi relief __PUNCT__ kati __PUNCT__
i don't see thi fals choic that senat obama and other set up between __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ we gotta wait for the long term __PUNCT__
get a presid in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
oil hit __MONEY__ a barrel todai __PUNCT__ i convinc that energi trader ar manipul the market __PUNCT__
i would launch an investig by the depart of justic and the feder trade commiss __PUNCT__
i would close what call the enron loophol which leav these trader total unregul __PUNCT__
so there a lot that i would do __PUNCT__
but provid thi direct relief __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ accord to the depart of energi __PUNCT__ would be about __MONEY__
but __PUNCT__ number two __PUNCT__ let start stand up for the vast major of american again __PUNCT__ when the feder reserv and the treasuri bail out their __PUNCT__ unintel __PUNCT__ to the tune of __MONEY__ billion i didn't hear all thi hand wring __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there were folk who were basic be __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ given an opportun to avoid the consequ of what thei had done __PUNCT__ which caus a lot of troubl for everybodi els __PUNCT__
the peopl i talk to who drive everi dai for a live __PUNCT__ thei just look for a littl help __PUNCT__
becaus ga is up __PUNCT__ groceri ar up __PUNCT__
thei feel realli squeez __PUNCT__
and i think thei need a presid __PUNCT__ and thei need advoc in public life __PUNCT__ who ar gonna take on the big interest like oil compani __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ yesterdai you said we should move on from reverend wright __PUNCT__ but your campaign continu to rais thi issu with superdeleg __PUNCT__

let talk about __PUNCT__ how thi is on the mind of a lot of peopl __PUNCT__
it someth that is in the atmospher __PUNCT__
but i have consist said that i want to run a campaign on the specif propos that i have put forth __PUNCT__
i been go across thi countri talk about solut __PUNCT__
i want to be a problem solver __PUNCT__
i think i the best candid __PUNCT__
i believ i be a better candid to beat john mccain __PUNCT__ and i think when voter __PUNCT__ superdeleg __PUNCT__ anybodi realli look at what at stake at thi elect __PUNCT__ thei should vote for somebodi who would be command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief on dai on and end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ and be the presid who turn the economi around __PUNCT__ that what i offer __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ ar superdeleg rais the issu of reverend wright with your campaign __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ kati __PUNCT__ i know the peopl across america have thought about thi __PUNCT__ like thei think about everyth els that come into the atmospher __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ peopl talk about that __PUNCT__
thei talk about a lot of thing __PUNCT__ but what peopl talk to me about ar ga price and groceri price and job __PUNCT__ and try to make sure that their kid have as good a futur as thei had __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ after tomorrow there will be more superdeleg up for grab than elect deleg __PUNCT__
you need the vast major of these remain superdeleg to becom the nomine and yet __PUNCT__ even sinc your victori in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ senat obama ha pick up __NUM__ new on __PUNCT__
you onli gotten __NUM__ __PUNCT__
why is that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we make a lot of progress and mani peopl ar wait to see what happen in the remain contest __PUNCT__
which i think is a __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ smart idea __PUNCT__
i now have more peopl who have vote for me __PUNCT__ if you includ michigan and florida __PUNCT__ and those were legal offici certifi elect __PUNCT__ so i sure includ them __PUNCT__
two point three million peopl vote in those elect __PUNCT__ so more peopl have vote for me __PUNCT__
the deleg race is veri tight __PUNCT__
neither of us can get to the nomin without get a lot of deleg __PUNCT__ but i think peopl ar go to ask themselv __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ who be the best presid __PUNCT__ who ha the abil to beat john mccain __PUNCT__ and i think thei look at __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ where we stand when it come to the vote of __PUNCT__ those who actual cast them over the cours of the last month __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ senat obama name wasn't even on the ballot in michigan __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ that wa hi choic __PUNCT__
nobodi made him take __PUNCT__ cross hi name from the ballot __PUNCT__
i kept it on becaus i happen to think the peopl of michigan deserv a chanc to have their voic heard and their vote count __PUNCT__
we agre onli that we wouldn't campaign __PUNCT__ and i didn't campaign __PUNCT__ and in both case __PUNCT__ the voter said __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__ we want to be part of thi process __PUNCT__
it a veri signific elect __PUNCT__
we want to be on record as sai who we think should be the nomine and the presid __PUNCT__
and i think the democrat parti ha to come to term with the fact that two of our biggest __PUNCT__ most import state that democrat sure have to try to win in the fall __PUNCT__ deserv to have their vote translat into deleg __PUNCT__
and i hope that that happen soon __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ when i spoke with senat obama earlier todai __PUNCT__ he said that your argument about attract work class white voter is the onli argument you have left __PUNCT__
and that he ha won these voter in critic state like iowa __PUNCT__ wisconsin and virginia __PUNCT__ so have you realli corner that market __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think it alwai import to look at the fact __PUNCT__ and to look at thi __PUNCT__ at the state that i won __PUNCT__
if we had the same rule as the republican __PUNCT__ which keep their ey on the prize __PUNCT__ which start it elector colleg in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i would alreadi be the nomine __PUNCT__ becaus i have won a major of the deleg from those big state __PUNCT__
that not the rule __PUNCT__ we plai by the rule __PUNCT__ but i want democrat to realli focu on who is best abl to win __PUNCT__ and i have a veri broad coalit of women and work peopl __PUNCT__ peopl who get up everi dai and work hard __PUNCT__ who we have to try to win back from the republican __PUNCT__ hispan voter __PUNCT__ young voter in a lot of state where i did better __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i think that i can make a much stronger case that i go into the race against john mccain much better posit to actual win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that what we gonna be talk about __PUNCT__ and that what eventu will have to decid after we finish all of these elect __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ will you stai in the game no matter what happen tomorrow __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i never make predict __PUNCT__
we gonna wait and see how the peopl of indiana and north carolina decid __PUNCT__
i start out so far behind in both of these state __PUNCT__ thei realli must __PUNCT__ win state for senat obama __PUNCT__
he ha told other __PUNCT__ everybodi for sever month that he would win both of these state __PUNCT__
we wage vigor campaign __PUNCT__
