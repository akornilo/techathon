keith olbermann __PUNCT__ host __PUNCT__ senat clinton join us now from harrisburg __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__
thank for some of your time tonight __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
how ar you __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i great __PUNCT__
thank a lot __PUNCT__ keith __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ let start with someth that got remark short shrift in last week debat __PUNCT__
is the elect in the fall __PUNCT__ in your estim __PUNCT__ go to be decid on the price of a gallon of ga and is it not true that a presid can't realli do anyth about the price of a gallon of ga __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think it go to be veri much influenc by the economi __PUNCT__
i don't know what els might happen between now and then but it appear to me that the economi is not go to recoveri and in fact the price of ga is go to be a big issu __PUNCT__
i think oil hit __MONEY__ a barrel todai which is just unbeliev __PUNCT__
when georg bush becam presid it wa __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__
i do think there ar thing that we can do in the short run __PUNCT__
i would __PUNCT__ if i were presid __PUNCT__ launch an investig to make sure that there not market manipul go on __PUNCT__
i am still haunt by what we learn dure the enron scandal about those electr trader manipul the market and caus the peopl in california __PUNCT__ oregon and washington to pai such high price that were not at all relat to suppli and demand __PUNCT__
i also releas some of the oil from the strateg petroleum reserv __PUNCT__
that ha in the past had a good effect on lower the cost at least in the short term __PUNCT__
and i would do what i could to try to allevi the cost right now if we could come up with a wai to make up for the lost revenu with a ga tax holidai like for exampl __PUNCT__ a windfal profit tax on the oil compani on a basi to try to fill the highwai trust fund while we let peopl off from pai the feder ga tax __PUNCT__
i would consid that __PUNCT__
but you right __PUNCT__
ultim we go to have to have an energi polici that actual move us from our depend on foreign oil and be liter over the oil barrel with the oil produc countri and compani __PUNCT__
i think if the presid were to make a speech tomorrow __PUNCT__ keith __PUNCT__ and that the kind of speech i would give right now __PUNCT__ that we ar final seriou __PUNCT__
we had enough of the problem that come from be so depend and not look to ourselv to produc homegrown energi to fuel our vehicl __PUNCT__ try to help our auto compani and auto worker __PUNCT__ quickli move to higher ga mileag car and more biofuel and all of the other solut that ar out there __PUNCT__ you would see the price drop becaus i think the compani and the countri that suppli our oil would be worri that we actual meant it thi time __PUNCT__
and thei would onc again try to lull us into a fals sens of secur __PUNCT__
so i would do all of that and i think it would have an impact and then of cours we have to follow through to make sure that we do everyth we can to take back control over our own energi destini __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ you mention the oil supplier and obvious lead us into someth els that realli flew by dure the debat that seem awfulli import __PUNCT__
in that debat you were ask about a hypothet iranian attack on israel and your hypothet respons as command in chief and you said __PUNCT__ let me read the quot exactli __PUNCT__ i think that we should be look to creat an umbrella of deterr that goe much further than israel __PUNCT__
of cours i would make it clear to the iranian that an attack on israel would includ massiv retali from the unit state but i would do the same with other countri in the region __PUNCT__
can you clarifi sinc there wa no follow __PUNCT__ up to that which hypothet middl east conflict would incur massiv retali by thi countri and what constitut massiv retali __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what we were talk about wa the potenti for a nuclear attack by iran __PUNCT__
if iran doe achiev what appear to be it continu goal of obtain nuclear weapon and i think deterr ha not been effect us in recent time __PUNCT__
we us it veri well dure the cold war when we had a bipolar world and what i think the presid should do and what our polici should be is to make it veri clear to the iranian that thei would be risk massiv retali were thei to launch a nuclear attack on israel __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ if iran were to becom a nuclear power it could set off an arm race that would be incred danger and destabil becaus the countri in the region ar not go to want iran to be the onli nuclear power so i could imagin that thei would be rush to obtain nuclear weapon themselv __PUNCT__
in order to forestal that __PUNCT__ creat some kind of a secur agreement where we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ you do not need to acquir nuclear weapon if you were the subject of an unprovok nuclear attack by iran __PUNCT__ the unit state and hopefulli our nato alli would respond to that as well __PUNCT__
it is a theori that some peopl have been look at becaus there is a fear that if iran __PUNCT__ which i hope we can prevent __PUNCT__ becom a nuclear power __PUNCT__ but if thei were to becom on some peopl worri that thei ar not deterr __PUNCT__ that thei somehow have a differ mindset and a worldview that might veri well lead the leadership to be will to becom martyr __PUNCT__
i don't bui that but i think we have to test it and on of the wai of test it is to make it veri clear that we ar not go to permit them if we can prevent it from them becom a nuclear power but were thei to becom some their us of nuclear weapon against israel would provok a nuclear respons from the unit state which person i believ would prevent it from happen and that we would try to help the other countri that might be intimid and bull into submiss by iran becaus thei were a nuclear power __PUNCT__ avoid that state by creat thi new secur umbrella __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ not to equat nuclear conflict or it us as a deterr to the pennsylvania primari but that is the other headlin __PUNCT__ i suppos __PUNCT__ of the dai __PUNCT__
let me ask you about the campaign and someth you said in pittsburgh todai and again __PUNCT__ let me read the quot about be presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it the toughest job in the world and you have to be readi for anyth __PUNCT__
two war __PUNCT__ skyrocket oil price __PUNCT__ an economi in crisi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ if you can't take the heat __PUNCT__ get out of the kitchen __PUNCT__
that is almost word for word the narrat of thi new ad that your campaign put out todai __PUNCT__ and that ad flash a veri brief imag of osama bin laden __PUNCT__
for nearli six year now sinc senat max cleland wa cut down by a commerci that featur a pictur of bin laden __PUNCT__ that ha been __PUNCT__ that tactic ha been kind of a bloodi shirt for mani democrat __PUNCT__
is it not just __PUNCT__ in your opinion __PUNCT__ as much of a scare tactic for a democrat to us it against anoth democrat __PUNCT__ as it is for a republican to us it in a race against the democrat __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ that ad is about leadership __PUNCT__ and i obvious believ i do have the leadership experi and qualiti to becom the presid and the command in chief __PUNCT__
and as you said in the begin __PUNCT__ lot of time import issu get short shrift in the back __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ forth in a campaign __PUNCT__
but the fact is that the next presid will be sworn in at a time of veri __PUNCT__ veri difficult world condit __PUNCT__ and here at home __PUNCT__ a lot of challeng __PUNCT__
thi is on of the most seriou elect we ever had __PUNCT__
and as peopl zero in on the choic thei have to make here in pennsylvania and around the countri and the remain contest and then certainli in the fall __PUNCT__ i want peopl to realli understand what a seriou decis it is __PUNCT__
there is noth at all that is in ani wai inappropri in sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ presid face the unexpect all the time __PUNCT__
katrina wa also a part of that ad __PUNCT__
we don't know what the next presid will face __PUNCT__
and i like to ask audienc to consid thi as a hire decis __PUNCT__
if you were to hire the person you thought wa readi on dai on to do the toughest job in the world __PUNCT__ what would you look for __PUNCT__ what kind of resum would you be try to seek out __PUNCT__ i obvious believ that i have a uniqu set of qualif and experi that prepar me for thi moment in time __PUNCT__
i would not be in thi race __PUNCT__ keith __PUNCT__ i would not be campaign hard across pennsylvania as i have been for the last week if i did not believ i would be the best presid of the three of us still in thi contest __PUNCT__ and that i would be the stronger candid against john mccain and the republican in the fall __PUNCT__
and i know that nation secur will be a prime issu when we get to the fall __PUNCT__
i don't think anybodi will be surpris by that __PUNCT__ and no democrat who want to win in the fall should be surpris __PUNCT__
we go to have to go toe to toe with john mccain on nation secur __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we go to have to stand up to whatev the republican throw our wai __PUNCT__
and i do think we ought to get real about some of the big issu that we go to face in the white hous start next __DATE__ and certainli dure the campaign lead up to the elect of the next presid __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ the resum of all three of you who ar in thi semi __PUNCT__ final round __PUNCT__ if you will __PUNCT__ of the hire decis came up over the weekend __PUNCT__
senat obama said all three of the current presidenti candid __PUNCT__ himself __PUNCT__ yourself and senat mccain __PUNCT__ would be better presid than is mr __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
you were critic of him for sai that __PUNCT__ senat obama that is __PUNCT__ by sai __PUNCT__ we need a nomine who will take on john mccain __PUNCT__ not cheer on john mccain __PUNCT__ and i will be that nomine __PUNCT__
but earlier in thi campaign __PUNCT__ last month on the __NUM__ of march __PUNCT__ you had also said that you thought it wa __PUNCT__ and again __PUNCT__ thi is a direct quot __PUNCT__ imper that each of us be abl to demonstr we can cross the command in chief threshold __PUNCT__ and i believ that i done that __PUNCT__
certainli senat mccain ha done that __PUNCT__ and you have to ask senat obama with respect to hi candidaci __PUNCT__
to some degre __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ in those remark from last month __PUNCT__ hadn't you alreadi cheer on senat mccain at senat obama expens __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ not at all __PUNCT__
i think that obvious __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha militari experi __PUNCT__
he ha a long experi on the senat arm servic committe __PUNCT__ where i serv with him __PUNCT__
and i think most peopl in thi countri would look at hi experi in the militari and in the senat __PUNCT__ and on nation secur sai he doe cross that threshold __PUNCT__
the problem is that he ha the wrong idea __PUNCT__
he would continu the bush polici on iraq __PUNCT__ which i think is wrong for the countri __PUNCT__
and in fact __PUNCT__ hi statement about hi be will to leav troop in iraq for up to __NUM__ year is someth that i absolut reject __PUNCT__
that would be wors than presid bush __PUNCT__
and when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ hi polici seem to be more of the same __PUNCT__ more of the same fail polici that have brought us to the brink of a recess __PUNCT__ that have brought us huge deficit and an explod debt __PUNCT__
and i think that wrong as well __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you can have a licens to practic law __PUNCT__ but that doesn't necessarili mean that somebodi should hire you to perform certain servic and take on certain case __PUNCT__
and i don't think that senat mccain is the presid or command in chief that we will need __PUNCT__
and i don't want to in ani wai sai he would be better __PUNCT__
it would be hard to be wors than georg bush __PUNCT__
i said sever year ago i think he is the wors presid we had __PUNCT__
and i think you echo that sentiment on mani occas on your show __PUNCT__
so i don't think that he would be better than georg bush __PUNCT__
i think he more of the same of presid bush __PUNCT__ and i don't think the countri can afford that __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ presid buchanan support ar still argu that point with both of us __PUNCT__ but we see ey to ey on it __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ olbermann __PUNCT__ on thing about the __PUNCT__ thi ha been touch on __PUNCT__ i sai onc an hour dure the entir campaign __PUNCT__ thi histor natur of both your candidaci and senat obama __PUNCT__
and it ha so mani import and posit thing for thi countri __PUNCT__
but there a __PUNCT__ necessarili an unfortun flip side to thi __PUNCT__
and i see it in person with some protest out here on the plaza next to thi veri studio in the last coupl of week __PUNCT__
do you believ __PUNCT__ as some of them seem to __PUNCT__ that critic of your campaign is necessarili sexism or larg sexism __PUNCT__ or sometim sexism __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think the histor natur of the campaign is caus a lot of cognit disson among so mani peopl __PUNCT__ keith __PUNCT__
and a few of them ar in the media __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ becaus no matter what happen in thi elect __PUNCT__ the fact that senat obama and i ar in thi close race for the democrat nomin mean that forev forward __PUNCT__ everi littl girl __PUNCT__ and everi african __PUNCT__ american child __PUNCT__ will be told that __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ you too can grow up to be presid __PUNCT__
i think that is not just histor __PUNCT__ i think it wonder __PUNCT__
but there have been __PUNCT__ and you report on some of them __PUNCT__ moment when peopl have said thing __PUNCT__ or express opinion __PUNCT__ that ar certainli not mine and certainli not senat obama __PUNCT__
speak for myself __PUNCT__ i know that i try to break the highest and hardest glass ceil that exist in our countri __PUNCT__
i take on that challeng willingli and gladli __PUNCT__ becaus i think it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
but i also believ that peopl have to take a look at us individu __PUNCT__
and i hope that what thei ar do __PUNCT__
that thei ask themselv who will do the best job under difficult circumst __PUNCT__
and we go to break some real barrier as we alreadi have in thi campaign __PUNCT__
and i hope that that will push our societi beyond some of the remnant of discrimin on the basi of race or gender that we still see from time to time __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ on thing about thi particular primari in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ a lot of us who felt that you and presid clinton were sore mistreat in the late __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to sai noth of the constitut be sore mistreat thought that the phrase that you introduc to that sad convers __PUNCT__ the vast right __PUNCT__ wing conspiraci __PUNCT__ wa pretti apt if not perfect __PUNCT__
and we thought __PUNCT__ mayb i just speak for myself __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__ but on of the few utterli unforgiv individu in that entir equat wa richard mellon scaif __PUNCT__ among other thing is the publish of the __PUNCT__ pittsburgh tribun __PUNCT__ review __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ serious __PUNCT__ to some degre __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i quit thi job the first time around becaus of richard mellon scaif and peopl like him __PUNCT__
and i realiz you have a primari to win but why on earth did you meet with richard mellon scaif and why did you accept or at least not reject hi endors of you over the weekend __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ keith __PUNCT__ nobodi wa more surpris than i when i wa invit to the editori board and i wa veri open to meet __PUNCT__ and frankli __PUNCT__ i wa veri curiou __PUNCT__
i had onli onc the gentleman onc in my life in a receiv line __PUNCT__ just in a matter of second __PUNCT__
obvious i wa on the receiv of quit a bit of hi activ dure the nineti __PUNCT__
much to everyon dismai __PUNCT__ most certainli mine __PUNCT__
but i wa curiou and he ha a lot of interest peopl who write for that peopl and work for him __PUNCT__
and it wa a fascin question __PUNCT__
a lot of give and take __PUNCT__
thei certainli don't agre with me on mani of my posit and i wa dumbfound both to have been invit and then to have been endors __PUNCT__
but i do believ in redempt __PUNCT__ keith __PUNCT__ i believ in deathb convers and i think it possibl for anyon to see the error of their wai __PUNCT__
so i bring peopl togeth as we speak __PUNCT__
anyon who doubt my abil to bridg the most incred chasm can point to those recent remark __PUNCT__
olbermann __PUNCT__ i leav the remark about the deathb convers when there more time __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ thank you for your time and safe travel __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
it great to talk with you __PUNCT__
