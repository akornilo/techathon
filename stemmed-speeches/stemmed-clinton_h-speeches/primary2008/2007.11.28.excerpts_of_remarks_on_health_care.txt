for more inform on the differ __PUNCT__ pleas visit __PUNCT__ __URL__
the follow is an excerpt from her speech __PUNCT__ among the democrat __PUNCT__ all of us except senat obama have univers health care that have put forth a plan __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ senat edward __PUNCT__ senat dodd __PUNCT__
we put forth univers health care plan becaus we know if we don't cover everybodi we go to leav million and million of peopl out __PUNCT__
it a substant and import differ becaus if you don't start with the goal of cover everi american __PUNCT__ you will never get there __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ here how my plan work __PUNCT__ if you alreadi have privat insur and you happi with it __PUNCT__ noth chang __PUNCT__ you keep that insur __PUNCT__
but if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ or if you don't like the insur you have __PUNCT__ you can choos from the wide varieti of option that ar avail to member of congress __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ now all american will have a respons to get and keep health insur __PUNCT__
i believ when you make thi the law of the land __PUNCT__ american will follow it and will purchas health insur __PUNCT__ far more than if we don't have that requir __PUNCT__
we provid tax credit to ensur that peopl can afford it __PUNCT__ and we give tax credit to small busi so that thei can cover more of their employe __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if you want to cover everyon __PUNCT__ you have to make health care a share respons __PUNCT__
i know you need to have the willing to stand up to the insur compani and the drug compani and demand univers coverag __PUNCT__
and that why i don't understand why we have thi differ on the democrat side becaus __PUNCT__ if anyth __PUNCT__ democrat should stand for univers health care __PUNCT__
that distinguish us from the republican __PUNCT__
the republican don't believ in it __PUNCT__ democrat do and we should fight for it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and we need a presid with the experi and the strength to make that happen __PUNCT__ otherwis we will be right back here in anoth __NUM__ or __NUM__ or __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and we will still have __NUM__ of million of peopl uninsur __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ our problem will be even wors becaus we would have lost more job becaus employ won't be will to provid insur __PUNCT__ thei will move job offshor becaus thei don't want to have those benefit and we will not be either competit or live up to our ideal __PUNCT__
it is imposs to get univers health care if you don't have a mandat __PUNCT__
that is a kei differ between my plan and senat obama plan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when senat obama wa a state senat in illinoi __PUNCT__ he help to creat a health care task forc that look into how to best cover everyon in illinoi with health insur __PUNCT__
thei releas their report earlier thi year __PUNCT__ and thei made it veri clear if you want to cover everyon __PUNCT__ you need to requir peopl to get health insur __PUNCT__
otherwis __PUNCT__ you will fail to cover __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the uninsur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ now there ar a number of wai of do thi __PUNCT__
on sensibl step would be to us what call default enrol __PUNCT__
if you don't make a choic __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we set up a system where peopl ar automat enrol when thei come into contact with the health care system or with school or colleg __PUNCT__
you could also work with employ so that thei automat enrol peopl __PUNCT__
the congress ha idea about thi and we work to make sure that these mandat ar enforc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ but what strang is that senat obama plan actual doe have a mandat __PUNCT__ but onli for children __PUNCT__ no requir for adult __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i work on thi issu a veri long time __PUNCT__
if you believ you can enforc a mandat on children that mean you enforc the mandat on the parent of the children to enrol the children __PUNCT__
so why would you leav out the parent of the children __PUNCT__ becaus what happen when you leav out the parent is that thei less like to get health care for their own children __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ thi is all connect __PUNCT__
and i proud that senat edward agre with me __PUNCT__ senat dodd agre with me __PUNCT__ governor richardson agre with me congressman kucinich ha a differ approach __PUNCT__ but he get everyon cover to have univers health care __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if we don't get univers health care __PUNCT__ then we will be betrai the democrat parti principl __PUNCT__
and it import that those who will caucu on __DATE__ understand thi differ __PUNCT__
senat obama plan doe not __PUNCT__ and cannot __PUNCT__ cover all american __PUNCT__
he call hi plan univers __PUNCT__ then he call it __PUNCT__ virtual univers __PUNCT__ but it is not either __PUNCT__
when it come to truth in label __PUNCT__ it simpli flunk the test __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ he been sai there no differ between our plan __PUNCT__
but hi plan would leav at least __NUM__ million american uninsur __PUNCT__ includ more than __NUM__ peopl right here in iowa __PUNCT__
so why don't we just sai everyon against the wall __PUNCT__ don't get insur __PUNCT__ we veri sorri but we just not go to have a plan that cover you __PUNCT__
who go to choos who doesn't get cover __PUNCT__ who go to leav out __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ or __NUM__ peopl in iowa __PUNCT__ that more than half the popul of de moin __PUNCT__
that a huge differ for those who get left out like the daughter of the woman that i met in greenvil __PUNCT__
and it a huge differ to me to leav __NUM__ million peopl virtual invis __PUNCT__ becaus that is what we would do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ there will be no invis american and there will be no american without health care __PUNCT__
that is on of my highest prioriti __PUNCT__ and i know it go to be a tough fight __PUNCT__
