and that is the crisi of __NUM__ million young men of color between the ag of __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thei ar out of school and out of work __PUNCT__
that includ nearli on out of everi three young african american men __PUNCT__
young men who ar not earn legal wage or learn market skill __PUNCT__
over half grow up in home without father __PUNCT__ a third wind up in the crimin justic system __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ each year ar claim by gun or violenc befor their __NUM__ birthdai __PUNCT__
now i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but i feel like i been listen to thi convers all my life __PUNCT__
and i firmli believ it is the wrong convers __PUNCT__ i reject it __PUNCT__
i reject a convers about __NUM__ million young men as a threat __PUNCT__ as a headach __PUNCT__ or as a lost caus __PUNCT__
i reject the convers about __NUM__ million disappoint __PUNCT__ failur __PUNCT__ and casualti of a broken system __PUNCT__
that is not who these young men ar __PUNCT__
i believ it is long past time for a new and differ convers __PUNCT__
it is time for america to begin a convers about __NUM__ million futur worker __PUNCT__ entrepreneur __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__ payer __PUNCT__ commun leader __PUNCT__ busi execut __PUNCT__
a convers about __NUM__ million futur husband and father and role model __PUNCT__
a convers about __NUM__ million boi who have the god __PUNCT__ given potenti to grow into strong __PUNCT__ proud __PUNCT__ love __PUNCT__ decent __PUNCT__ product __PUNCT__ accomplish men with our help and support __PUNCT__
that is the convers i want to have with you and america __PUNCT__ and that is the convers i want to take with me into the white hous in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
to put forth an agenda to finish the job __PUNCT__
it time __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__ for a chang __PUNCT__
and i have seen the potenti __PUNCT__
as a young lawyer right out of law school __PUNCT__ i didn't want to go to wall street firm __PUNCT__ i didn't want to clerk for a judg __PUNCT__ all i want to do wa to work for marian wright edelman at the children defens fund __PUNCT__
that wa my goal __PUNCT__ i had met her __PUNCT__ she had gone to yale law school about __NUM__ year befor me __PUNCT__ she wa legendari with her work in mississippi on behalf of civil right and the naacp legal defens fund __PUNCT__
i heard she wa speak at yale __PUNCT__ i went to introduc myself to her dure my veri first year in law school __PUNCT__
heard her speak __PUNCT__ wa galvan __PUNCT__ went up to her and said __PUNCT__ i want to work for you __PUNCT__
and she said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that nice __PUNCT__ but i can't pai you __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that a problem becaus i work my wai through law school __PUNCT__ so i have to get paid __PUNCT__
and she said __PUNCT__ if you can figur out how to get yourself paid __PUNCT__ you can come work for me __PUNCT__
so appli for and i receiv a law student civil right research council internship __PUNCT__ which paid me to be abl to go and do the work that ha been the passion and call of my life through my year of public servic __PUNCT__ and now my year in public offic __PUNCT__
and i rememb veri well on of the first assign that marian gave me wa to go to a coupl of state and find out if we could stop them from jail children with adult __PUNCT__
and then to go door to door and ask peopl if thei had children who weren't in school __PUNCT__ becaus back in those dai children were kept out of school for all kind of reason __PUNCT__
some of them had physic ailment __PUNCT__ some of them had behavior problem __PUNCT__ some of them had to help support their famili __PUNCT__
so i have been focus on what we need to do to help children succe __PUNCT__
and i have to tell you in all my __NUM__ year as an advoc for children and famili __PUNCT__ i have never met a child without potenti __PUNCT__
and these __NUM__ million young men ar no differ __PUNCT__
and when we write them off and leav them behind __PUNCT__ when we squander their potenti __PUNCT__ we squander america potenti __PUNCT__
and that is noth short of a moral crisi __PUNCT__
but let be clear __PUNCT__ thi is not just a moral crisi __PUNCT__ it is an econom crisi __PUNCT__
and it not just an urban econom crisi __PUNCT__
it is not just an african american econom crisi __PUNCT__
it is an american econom and moral crisi __PUNCT__
and when we let these young boi and men fall through the crack __PUNCT__ we make a decis to spend __MONEY__ billion a year on prison __PUNCT__
now we mai not draw the connect all the time __PUNCT__ but you and i know that the decis we make __PUNCT__
we have decid that we go to spend poorli __PUNCT__ instead of spend it smartli __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ across america __PUNCT__ job ar go empti becaus compani can't find train __PUNCT__ skill employe to fill them __PUNCT__
so ultim __PUNCT__ the crisi of young men of color is a nation crisi __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ i will call for a nation respons __PUNCT__ and a nation commit __PUNCT__ to address it __PUNCT__
i will call everyon to the tabl __PUNCT__
on of the that thing i realli believ in __PUNCT__ is get everybodi out there togeth __PUNCT__ and roll up our sleev __PUNCT__ and start to act like american again __PUNCT__
we the peopl who ar suppos to be the problem solver __PUNCT__
we not suppos to stand on the sidelin __PUNCT__ wring our hand talk about how terribl thing ar __PUNCT__
we suppos to be work togeth to solv problem __PUNCT__
and i want state and local govern __PUNCT__ univers __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ profit __PUNCT__ church __PUNCT__ individu __PUNCT__
and i go ask on simpl question __PUNCT__ what will you do __PUNCT__ not what you talk about __PUNCT__ but what will you do __PUNCT__ not anoth report __PUNCT__ but what will you do in order to deal with thi crisi __PUNCT__ i am not go to accept half __PUNCT__ step or piecem measur as an answer __PUNCT__
we need a smart __PUNCT__ bold __PUNCT__ dare __PUNCT__ comprehens approach __PUNCT__
on base on the fundament premis that these young men ar all our children __PUNCT__
all of our respons __PUNCT__
becaus after all these year __PUNCT__ i still believ it take a villag to rais a child __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ that is why todai __PUNCT__ i am announc my youth opportun agenda __PUNCT__ which goe hand in hand with the opportun compact __PUNCT__
thi is my plan __PUNCT__ as your presid __PUNCT__ to build that villag __PUNCT__
an america where everi child is valu for hi or her god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__ and where all of us __PUNCT__ from our famili to our commun to our countri __PUNCT__ resolv to do whatev we can to help each child realiz that potenti __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i believ the initi ha to start from dai on __PUNCT__ the veri dai a child is born __PUNCT__ with earli intervent to help that child get on the right path __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i go to focu like a laser on those earli year __PUNCT__
and it not just focus on the children __PUNCT__ let focu on the parent and the grand __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ and the aunt and the uncl __PUNCT__ and the brother and the sister __PUNCT__
we know what work __PUNCT__ i been do thi for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i start off at the yale child studi center __PUNCT__ i done it through arkansa __PUNCT__ and when i wa privileg to work in the white hous for my husband __PUNCT__ and now in the senat __PUNCT__
we know what work __PUNCT__
let take these proven program like nurs home visit program __PUNCT__ where we send in qualifi nurs and social worker and other to go in and help these young mother and father understand what thei need to do for their children __PUNCT__
let emphas a program i help to start dure the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the earli head start program __PUNCT__
let expand and build on head start __PUNCT__ a proven success __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i have made a commit to univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten for everi four year old __PUNCT__ access to qualiti __PUNCT__ afford earli learn when it realli can make a differ in the live of these children __PUNCT__
an astonish fact __PUNCT__ not from me becaus i believ thi base on all the work i done __PUNCT__
but jame heckman __PUNCT__ nobl prize __PUNCT__ win economist from the univers of chicago __PUNCT__ hardli thought to be a hotb of fuzzi think and liber thought __PUNCT__ he did a studi __PUNCT__ and he conclud that if we had univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten __PUNCT__ we would close by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the achiev gap between white and black children __PUNCT__
just with that earli invest __PUNCT__ children will stai in school longer __PUNCT__ thei do better __PUNCT__
let make that on of our prioriti __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ onc our children start school __PUNCT__ we have to provid earli mentor and support to keep them on the path to success __PUNCT__
it is not enough to give young men of color a chanc to succe __PUNCT__ if then after thei start down thi long and difficult path we step off of it __PUNCT__
we need to be hold hand move forward togeth __PUNCT__
we know that mani young men drop out of school __PUNCT__
did you know that a child in america drop out of school everi __NUM__ second __PUNCT__ mani don't make it through high school __PUNCT__ some don't make it through junior high school __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will expand program like gear up that interven in middl school to provid mentor and tutor __PUNCT__
i want colleg visit to help young peopl understand thi can be part of their futur __PUNCT__
program like the hillsid work scholarship connect __PUNCT__ creat with the help of the rochest urban leagu in rochest __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__ that develop individu colleg and career success plan for middl school student and give these student a job __PUNCT__
give them a job after school __PUNCT__ dure vacat becaus thei have to be expos to the cultur of work and learn all those habit and that disciplin __PUNCT__
and it ha proven to be a great success __PUNCT__
i also want to see school like eagl academi in new york __PUNCT__ in the bronx __PUNCT__
i wa honor to help start thi charter school with the on hundr black men in new york __PUNCT__
i think david bank __PUNCT__ who wa the princip __PUNCT__ is here __PUNCT__
we need a thousand of eagl academi for young men of color __PUNCT__ where thei feel accept __PUNCT__ support __PUNCT__ mentor and help __PUNCT__
i want to us a mentorship model that will reach an addit on million student __PUNCT__
my administr will provid __MONEY__ million over five year to establish internship opportun that will match student with busi __PUNCT__ with union __PUNCT__ with non __PUNCT__ profit like the urban leagu to provid the train thei need to thrive in profession environ __PUNCT__
thi isn't just a chanc to enrich our children __PUNCT__
it not a corpor chariti program __PUNCT__
we have to give both side of the equat __PUNCT__ the young men and the employ __PUNCT__ a chanc to discov and develop each other __PUNCT__ and to have then __PUNCT__ an opportun wait for that young person __PUNCT__
the third part of my agenda involv build comprehens __PUNCT__ commun __PUNCT__ base program to reach out to young peopl who ar fail to thrive __PUNCT__
program that don't just keep them from fall through the crack __PUNCT__ but actual start fill in the crack __PUNCT__
i go to ask our mayor and other local leader to gather with repres from across the commun to develop such program __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that might mean creat on __PUNCT__ stop youth center like those in baltimor and lo angel where case manag work to connect young peopl with tutor __PUNCT__ job train __PUNCT__ and other support servic __PUNCT__
it might mean strengthen altern educ and career academi __PUNCT__ apprenticeship and skill train __PUNCT__
i had a visit from the new york auto dealer a year or two ago __PUNCT__
thei said __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ we have __NUM__ job that we can't get fill for auto __PUNCT__ mechan __PUNCT__
these ar job in new york start at __MONEY__
where do we go to find such peopl __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ to their credit __PUNCT__ thei start a school __PUNCT__
but we need to have more partnership like that __PUNCT__
i talk about program that give young peopl the skill and confid thei need to compet for the high __PUNCT__ tech 21ast centuri job __PUNCT__ becaus on of the reason those auto mechan job ar harder to fill is becaus you have to know about comput __PUNCT__
it no longer a low skill job __PUNCT__ it a high skill job with a veri good salari __PUNCT__
program like focu hope in detroit that train young peopl to fill the __NUM__ machinist job open up each year in that citi __PUNCT__
program like year up that give young peopl the skill to land good financi servic job in downtown provid __PUNCT__ rhode island __PUNCT__
program that train student for new __PUNCT__ renew energi __PUNCT__ green collar __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__
youthbuild __PUNCT__ which have been put our young peopl to work __PUNCT__ thei begin to train young peopl to do thi and i have a program that will creat __NUM__ job of peopl that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
if we go to start get seriou about altern energi and do thing like solar __PUNCT__ somebodi got to climb up there and put that solar panel on the roof __PUNCT__
we go to creat million of job if we do thi right and a lot of them will be in the inner citi __PUNCT__
we also need to make sure our young peopl can get these job in the first place __PUNCT__
ye there ar problem becaus of low educ and low skill __PUNCT__ lack of mentor and network __PUNCT__
but let be frank here __PUNCT__
some of those problem that stand in the wai of young peopl and job is becaus of discrimin __PUNCT__ plain and simpl __PUNCT__
which bring me to my fourth point __PUNCT__
a recent studi show that when employ were present __PUNCT__ i almost done __PUNCT__ mark __PUNCT__
but you know i just fire up about thi you can't stop me now __PUNCT__
a recent studi show that when employ were present with similarli qualifi white and black applic __PUNCT__ thei were twice as like to hire the white applic __PUNCT__
thei even hire white applic with crimin record at the same or higher rate than black applic __PUNCT__
so we go to get back to a justic depart and a civil right divis that actual enforc the law __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ we have got to tackl two remain problem __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ how do we help these young men be respons father __PUNCT__ we got to revers presid bush dramat cut in child support enforc __PUNCT__
we got to make sure that everi dollar goe to the children who need it __PUNCT__
we got to make sure that the young men have the monei to pai the child support which mean rais the minimum wage again __PUNCT__
and we have to confront the devast impact of the crimin justic system __PUNCT__
the brutal revolv door ha alreadi claim so mani young live __PUNCT__
and i want to have a second chang program that realli focus on how we go to keep our young peopl out of the crimin justic system __PUNCT__ and how we go to rehabilit then and give them a new chanc when thei come out __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i know thi is not go to be easi __PUNCT__ but i am up for it if you ar __PUNCT__
i am confid and optimist we can make thi happen togeth __PUNCT__
now there will be all the naysay who sai __PUNCT__ oh my good we can't do it __PUNCT__
polit is so hard __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we can't listen to them jame baldwin onc said __PUNCT__ those who sai it can't be done ar usual interrupt by those who ar do it __PUNCT__
and so we got to get about the busi of do it __PUNCT__
let me tell you that if we work togeth __PUNCT__ if we elect a presid who care passion about our young peopl __PUNCT__ understand what it will take to make the opportun compact real in their live __PUNCT__ we go to see chang in america __PUNCT__
i want to be your partner __PUNCT__
i look forward to work with you __PUNCT__
let go out and make it happen __PUNCT__
thank you all __PUNCT__ and god bless you __PUNCT__
