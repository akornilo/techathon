and we travel it with like __PUNCT__ mind friend and alli and those will to take risk for peac around the world __PUNCT__
it ha been five year thi week sinc our presid took us to war in iraq __PUNCT__
in that time __PUNCT__ our brave men and women in uniform have done everyth we ask of them and more __PUNCT__
thei were ask to remov saddam hussein from power and bring him to justic and thei did __PUNCT__
thei were ask to give the iraqi peopl the opportun for free and fair elect and thei did __PUNCT__
thei were ask to give the iraqi govern the space and time for polit reconcili __PUNCT__ and thei did __PUNCT__
so for everi american soldier who ha made the ultim sacrific for thi mission __PUNCT__ we should imagin carv in stone __PUNCT__ thei gave their life for the greatest gift on can give to a fellow human be __PUNCT__ the gift of freedom __PUNCT__
and to our veteran and all those serv in iraq todai __PUNCT__ i want to send a strong and clear messag __PUNCT__ your extraordinari devot to our countri and to your servic make us proud and profoundli grate everi singl dai __PUNCT__
the mistak in iraq ar not the respons of our men and women in uniform but of their command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__
from the decis to rush to war without allow the weapon inspector to finish their work or wait for diplomaci to run it cours __PUNCT__
to the failur to send enough troop and provid proper equip for them __PUNCT__
to the denial of the exist of a rise insurg and the failur to adjust the militari strategi __PUNCT__
to the continu support for a govern unwil to make the necessari polit compromis __PUNCT__
the command decis were root in polit and ideolog __PUNCT__ heedless of sound strategi and common sens __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ ten month from now we will have a new presid __PUNCT__ and a new opportun to chang cours in iraq __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ the critic question is how can we end thi war respons and restor america leadership in the world __PUNCT__ it won't be easi __PUNCT__
there is no magic wand to wave __PUNCT__
bring our troop home safe will take a presid who is readi to be command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief on dai on __PUNCT__ a presid who know our militari and ha earn their respect __PUNCT__
bring last stabil to the region will take a presid with the strength and determin __PUNCT__ the knowledg and confid to bring our troop home __PUNCT__ to rebuild our militari readi __PUNCT__ to care for our veteran __PUNCT__ and to redoubl our effort against al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__
if you give me the chanc __PUNCT__ i will be that presid __PUNCT__
i will start by face the condit on the ground in iraq as thei ar __PUNCT__ not as we hope or wish them to be __PUNCT__
presid bush point to the reduct in violenc in iraq last year and claim the surg is work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i applaud ani decreas in violenc __PUNCT__
that is alwai good new __PUNCT__
but the point of the surg wa to give the iraqi the time and space for polit reconcili __PUNCT__
yet todai __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern ha fail to provid basic servic for it citizen __PUNCT__
thei have yet to pass legisl ensur the equit distribut of oil revenu __PUNCT__ yet even to pass a law set the date of provinci elect __PUNCT__
corrupt and dysfunct is rampant __PUNCT__ and last week gener petraeu himself conced that no on __PUNCT__ in either the u. __PUNCT__ govern or the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ feel that there ha been suffici progress by ani mean in the area of nation reconcili __PUNCT__
so by the middl of thi summer when the addit surg forc have been sent home __PUNCT__ we be right back at squar on with __NUM__ or more troop on the ground in iraq __PUNCT__
that presid bush seem to want to keep as mani troop there after the surg as befor and sai that do otherwis would endang our progress is a clear admiss that the surg ha not accomplish it goal __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ as we continu to polic iraq civil war __PUNCT__ the threat to our nation secur __PUNCT__ our economi __PUNCT__ and our stand in the world continu to mount __PUNCT__
the live of our brave men and women ar at stake __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ of them have __PUNCT__ by now __PUNCT__ made that ultim sacrific __PUNCT__
ten of thousand more have suffer wound both visibl and invis to their bodi __PUNCT__ their mind __PUNCT__ and their heart __PUNCT__
their famili have sacrif __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ in empti place at the dinner tabl __PUNCT__ in the struggl to rais children alon __PUNCT__ in the wrench revers of parent buri children __PUNCT__
the strength of our militari is at stake __PUNCT__
onli on of our armi brigad is certifi by the armi to be readi __PUNCT__
our arm forc ar stretch to near the break point with mani of our troop on their second __PUNCT__ third __PUNCT__ or fourth tour of duti __PUNCT__
our econom secur is at stake __PUNCT__
take into consider the long __PUNCT__ term cost of replac equip and provid medic care for troop and survivor __PUNCT__ benefit for their famili __PUNCT__ the war in iraq could ultim cost well over __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
that is enough to provid health care for all __NUM__ million uninsur american and qualiti pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten for everi american child __PUNCT__ solv the hous crisi onc and for all __PUNCT__ make colleg afford for everi american student __PUNCT__ and provid tax relief to ten of million of middl class famili __PUNCT__
our abil to win the war in afghanistan is at stake __PUNCT__
when i first visit afghanistan in __NUM__ i wa greet by a soldier who said __PUNCT__ welcom to the forgotten front line in the war on terror __PUNCT__
sinc then __PUNCT__ the taliban and al qaeda have continu to gain new foothold throughout the countri __PUNCT__ and as a result __PUNCT__ the overal terrorist threat __PUNCT__ as our own intellig commun ha note __PUNCT__ is grow __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ our leadership in the world and our abil to front global challeng __PUNCT__ present and futur __PUNCT__ is at stake __PUNCT__
from extrem in pakistan __PUNCT__ to nuclear ambit in iran and north korea __PUNCT__ to troubl antidemocrat trend in russia and latin america __PUNCT__ to the threat of global epidem and global warm and to the rise of china __PUNCT__
the more the world regard us with suspicion rather than admir __PUNCT__ the more difficult it is to confront these challeng __PUNCT__
despit the evid __PUNCT__ presid bush is determin to continu hi fail polici in iraq until he leav offic __PUNCT__
and senat mccain will gladli accept the torch and stai the cours __PUNCT__ keep troop in iraq for up to __NUM__ year if necessari __PUNCT__
thei both want to keep us ti to anoth countri civil war __PUNCT__ a war we cannot win __PUNCT__
that in a nutshel is the bush/mccain iraq polici __PUNCT__
don't learn from your mistak __PUNCT__ repeat them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ here is the inescap realiti __PUNCT__
we can have hundr of thousand of troop on the ground for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but that will not chang the fact that there is no militari solut to the situat in iraq __PUNCT__
and don't just take it from me __PUNCT__
at hi confirm hear __PUNCT__ admir mullen __PUNCT__ chairman of the joint chief of staff __PUNCT__ said that without nation polit reconcili __PUNCT__ no amount of troop in no amount of time will make much of a differ __PUNCT__
we simpli cannot give the iraqi govern an endless blank check __PUNCT__
each pass month we stai in iraq give the iraqi govern more time to avoid the hard decis on how to split the oil monei and how to share polit power __PUNCT__
senat mccain and presid bush claim withdraw is defeat __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let be clear __PUNCT__ withdraw is not defeat __PUNCT__
defeat is keep troop in iraq for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we simpli cannot give the iraqi govern an endless blank check __PUNCT__
each pass month we stai in iraq give the iraqi govern more time to avoid the hard decis on how to split the oil monei and how to share polit power __PUNCT__
senat mccain and presid bush claim withdraw is defeat __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let be clear __PUNCT__ withdraw is not defeat __PUNCT__
defeat is keep troop in iraq for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
defeat is strain our allianc and lose our stand in the world __PUNCT__
defeat is drain our resourc and divert attent from our kei interest __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ withdraw is not risk __PUNCT__ free __PUNCT__ but the risk of stai in iraq ar certain __PUNCT__
and a well __PUNCT__ plan withdraw is the on and onli path to a polit solut __PUNCT__
the onli wai to spur the iraqi to take respons for their own futur and to ensur that we don't bear that respons indefinit __PUNCT__
the onli wai to spur other countri to do their part to help secur stabil in the region __PUNCT__
the commit to stai in iraq ha driven presid bush foreign polici __PUNCT__
it look like it would drive senat mccain foreign polici as well __PUNCT__ but it will not drive mine __PUNCT__
my foreign polici will be driven by what is in america nation secur interest __PUNCT__
so it is time to end thi war as quickli and respons as possibl __PUNCT__
that ha been my mission in the senat __PUNCT__ and it will be my mission start on dai on as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
for the past five year __PUNCT__ i have serv on the senat arm servic committe __PUNCT__
i have been to iraq and afghanistan three time __PUNCT__
i have met with our soldier and militari leader __PUNCT__
i have met with iraqi __PUNCT__ local __PUNCT__ region __PUNCT__ and nation elect and other influenti offici __PUNCT__
here at home i attend countless meet and committe hear where i have challeng high __PUNCT__ rank pentagon offici and militari leader investig the situat in iraq __PUNCT__ probe the fact present __PUNCT__ and demand real answer to tough question __PUNCT__
and i am honor that more than __NUM__ of america most esteem former admir and gener __PUNCT__ includ two former chairmen of the joint chief of staff and five retir offic of the four __PUNCT__ star rank have endors my candidaci __PUNCT__
the american peopl don't have to guess whether i readi to lead or whether i understand the realiti on the ground in iraq or whether i be too depend on advis to help me determin the right wai forward __PUNCT__
i been work dai __PUNCT__ in and dai __PUNCT__ out in the senat to provid leadership to end thi war __PUNCT__
that why i cosponsor legisl with senat robert byrd to reauthor the war __PUNCT__ legisl that would actual end the presid author to fight it __PUNCT__
that why i start lai the ground work for a swift and respons withdraw begin in earli __NUM__ by demand that the pentagon start plan for it now __PUNCT__
i introduc legisl ensur that congress would be brief on those plan and that also why i work to block presid bush effort to keep thi war go after he leav offic __PUNCT__
i introduc legisl ban him from unilater negoti a long __PUNCT__ term secur commit to iraq __PUNCT__ includ the possibl of perman base __PUNCT__
i believ what matter in thi campaign is not just the promis we made to end the war __PUNCT__ what matter is what we actual done when it came time to match word with action __PUNCT__
becaus more than anyth els __PUNCT__ what we done is an indic of what we do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my democrat oppon talk a great deal about a speech he gave in __NUM__ and i commend him for make that speech __PUNCT__
speak out for what you believ is a solemn __PUNCT__ patriot duti __PUNCT__
he is ask us to judg him by hi word __PUNCT__ and word can be power __PUNCT__ but onli if the speaker translat them into action and solut __PUNCT__
senat obama hold up hi origin opposit to the war on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ but he didn't start work aggress to end the war until he start run for presid __PUNCT__
so when he had a chanc to act on hi speech __PUNCT__ he chose silenc instead __PUNCT__
and out campaign senat obama tell voter that as presid he withdraw combat brigad from iraq within __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ but on of hi top foreign polici advis told a differ stori __PUNCT__
she told a british televis report __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ he will __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ not reli on some plan that he craft as a presidenti candid or as a u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
senat obama ha said often that word matter __PUNCT__
i strongli agre __PUNCT__
but give speech alon won't end the war and make campaign promis you might not keep certainli won't end it __PUNCT__
in the end the true test is not the speech a presid deliv __PUNCT__ it whether the presid deliv on the speech __PUNCT__
i have concret __PUNCT__ detail plan to end thi war __PUNCT__ and i have not waiver in my commit to follow through on them __PUNCT__
on choic in thi elect is senat mccain __PUNCT__
he will to keep thi war go for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
you can count on him to do that __PUNCT__
anoth choic is senat obama who ha promis to bring combat troop out in __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ but accord to hi foreign polici advis __PUNCT__ you can't count on him to do that __PUNCT__
in uncertain time __PUNCT__ we cannot afford uncertain leadership __PUNCT__
here what you can count on me to do __PUNCT__ provid the leadership to end thi war quickli and respons __PUNCT__
todai i like to talk about how i will do that __PUNCT__ how as presid __PUNCT__ i will bring our troop home __PUNCT__ work to bring stabil in the region __PUNCT__ and replac militari forc with a new diplomat initi to engag countri around the world in help to secur iraq futur __PUNCT__
the most import part of my plan is the first step __PUNCT__ to bring our troop home and send the strongest possibl messag to the iraqi that thei must take respons for their own futur __PUNCT__
no more talk of perman occup __PUNCT__ no more polic a civil war __PUNCT__ no more do for the iraqi what thei need to be do for themselv __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ on of my first offici action will be to conven the joint chief of staff __PUNCT__ my secretari of defens and my nation secur council and direct them to draw up a clear __PUNCT__ viabl plan to start bring our troop home within the first __NUM__ dai of my take offic __PUNCT__
a plan base on my consult with the militari to remov on to two brigad a month __PUNCT__ a plan that reduc the risk of attack as thei depart __PUNCT__
as we bring our troop home __PUNCT__ i will ensur we ar fulli prepar to take care of them and their famili onc thei have return __PUNCT__
i will direct the depart of defens and the depart of veteran affair to prepar a comprehens plan to provid the highest qualiti of health care __PUNCT__ disabl benefit __PUNCT__ and social servic for everi singl servic member includ everi member of the nation guard and reserv as well as their famili __PUNCT__ and i will make sure thi plan is promptli implement __PUNCT__
in the senat i proud to have reach across the aisl to provid access to tricar for all member of the nation guard and reserv __PUNCT__ even when thei not deploi __PUNCT__
and to have pass my hero at home act to help famili member care for those who traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__ the signatur injuri of thi war becaus i believ when brave men and women sign up to serv our countri __PUNCT__ we sign up to serv them too __PUNCT__
that is why i will also immedi adopt repres john murtha urgent propos to reduc the strain on our troop by reduc the permiss length of oversea deploy __PUNCT__
go forward __PUNCT__ we will ensur that our troop spend as much time at tome as thei have spent deploi __PUNCT__
so everi month thei spend in the field __PUNCT__ thei will be guarante on month here at home __PUNCT__
i will also implement a propos that i __PUNCT__ repres murtha __PUNCT__ and other have been call for __PUNCT__ requir that befor ani brigad is deploi __PUNCT__ the secretari of defens must certifi to congress that it is fulli combat readi __PUNCT__
send brigad that do not meet thi standard put our soldier in danger and our mission in iraq or elsewher at risk __PUNCT__
in addit to remov american troop from iraq __PUNCT__ i will also work to remov arm privat militari contractor who ar conduct combat __PUNCT__ orient and secur function in iraq __PUNCT__
for five yea their behavior and lack of supervis and account have often erod our credibl __PUNCT__ endang u. __PUNCT__ and iraqi live and undermin our mission __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat obama and i have a substant disagr here __PUNCT__
he won't rule out continu to us arm privat militari contractor in iraq to do job that histor have been done by the u. __PUNCT__ militari or govern personnel __PUNCT__
when i am presid i will ask the joint chief for their help in reduc relianc on arm privat militari contractor __PUNCT__
with the goal of ultim implement a ban on such contractor __PUNCT__
i alreadi cosponsor the stop secur outsourc act requir that secur servic for personnel at ani u. __PUNCT__ diplomat or consular mission be provid onli by feder govern personnel __PUNCT__
it also a time we put an end __PUNCT__ onc and for all __PUNCT__ to the no __PUNCT__ bid contract that squander taxpay monei while line the pocket of the presid croni __PUNCT__
between __NUM__ and __NUM__ spend on no __PUNCT__ bid contract more than doubl __PUNCT__ repres half of all feder procur spend __PUNCT__
todai compani like halliburton ar enjoi record profit thank to a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ increas in taxpay fund award to them __PUNCT__
but a recent congression report identifi __NUM__ contract valu at __MONEY__ trillion where feder auditor found massiv overcharg __PUNCT__ wast spend and poor oversight __PUNCT__
i propos legisl to ensur that all new spend in __NUM__ is done through competit contract process __PUNCT__
the head of each agenc would have to certifi to congress under a sworn affidavit that their contract award process ar open and competit __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will work to pass thi legisl into law and to end the era of no __PUNCT__ bid contract and handout to halliburton __PUNCT__
it an interest comparison __PUNCT__
we had a lot of talk in thi town and elsewher about earmark __PUNCT__ and i am on of those who believ we need more transpar and disclosur in the earmark process __PUNCT__
but no __PUNCT__ bid contract ar ten time more costli than earmark __PUNCT__ and when i introduc my legisl to elimin no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ i could not get __PUNCT__ at least as of thi moment __PUNCT__ senat mccain support for that __PUNCT__
as we bring our troop and contractor home __PUNCT__ we cannot lose sight of our strateg interest in thi region __PUNCT__
the realiti is that thi war ha made the terrorist stronger __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thei mai not have been in iraq befor the war __PUNCT__ thei ar there now __PUNCT__ and we cannot allow iraq to becom a breed ground and safe haven for terrorist who seek to attack us and our friend and alli __PUNCT__
so let me be clear __PUNCT__ under my plan __PUNCT__ withdraw from iraq will not mean retreat from fight terror in iraq __PUNCT__
that why i will order small __PUNCT__ elit strike forc to engag in target oper against al qaeda in iraq __PUNCT__
thi will protect iraqi citizen __PUNCT__ our alli __PUNCT__ and our famili right here at home __PUNCT__
the second part of my plan involv work to secur stabil within iraq as we bring our troop home __PUNCT__ stabil that will be kei to a success withdraw of our troop __PUNCT__
i believ it realli quit simpl __PUNCT__ greater polit and econom stabil mean safer condit for our depart troop and a smoother disengag from our militari action across iraq __PUNCT__
right now no on doubt that the iraqi govern is fail it citizen __PUNCT__
govern offici refus to take the step need to order to advanc a solut __PUNCT__ improv the economi __PUNCT__ quell sectarian violenc and better the live of ordinari iraqi __PUNCT__
these fail ar __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ the fault of the iraqi and in part due to the bush administr failur to match militari effort with polit on __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ ha creat an arm local secur forc __PUNCT__ such as the awaken in anbar and the __PUNCT__ concern local citizen __PUNCT__ but thei fail to hold the iraqi govern to it agreement to integr these local militia and volunt into provinci polic forc or the nation armi __PUNCT__
violenc ha fallen in the short run __PUNCT__ but in the long run sectarian divis among iraqi mai onli deepen __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we will pursu a more integr strategi __PUNCT__
we empow local leader and us u. __PUNCT__ and intern influenc to press the iraqi to reach polit reconcili __PUNCT__ and i will call on the unit nation to strengthen it role in promot thi reconcili __PUNCT__
not have been a parti to the mistak of the path five year __PUNCT__ the u.n __PUNCT__ which ha alreadi provid valuabl technic assist in iraq __PUNCT__ is far more like to be view as a neutral __PUNCT__ honest broker than the unit state __PUNCT__ especi when it act on behalf of a broad coalit of concern state and the intern commun __PUNCT__
the new unit nation secretari gener __PUNCT__ ban ki __PUNCT__ moon __PUNCT__ ha indic he is will to plai a kei role in assist the iraqi __PUNCT__
i will also work with china and russia to ensur that the u.n __PUNCT__ envoi in iraq ha the necessari author by obtain the secur council explicit endors of a strengthen u.n __PUNCT__ mandat to promot reconcili __PUNCT__
i will also call upon the u.n __PUNCT__ to help overse the resettl of the million of refuge who have fled iraq or have been displac intern __PUNCT__
mani ar live in desper condit creat not just a humanitarian crisi but on affect region stabil that pose direct threat to our secur here at home which we must address immedi __PUNCT__
while we focu our effort on improv condit so iraqi don't have to flee in the first place __PUNCT__ we have to recogn our moral oblig to help those we have put at risk in iraq __PUNCT__ the interpret __PUNCT__ soldier who have assist our troop __PUNCT__
we will work with govern in both the middl east and the west __PUNCT__ includ of cours the unit state __PUNCT__ to find place for asylum seeker __PUNCT__ and we will work with the u.n __PUNCT__ to develop a plan to help them return __PUNCT__ if possibl __PUNCT__ to iraq onc the countri ha stabil __PUNCT__
i would further seek to stabil iraq by insist that the countri oil revenu __PUNCT__ instead of u. __PUNCT__ taxpay dollar __PUNCT__ increasingli be us to fund iraq reconstruct __PUNCT__
when presid bush began thi war __PUNCT__ hi administr claim that iraqi oil revenu would pai for iraq reconstruct __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern ha now earn ten of billion of dollar from oil __PUNCT__
some estim indic that revenu thi year will top __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
yet sinc the begin of the war __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ ha alloc roughli the same amount of monei as iraq for reconstruct __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion from us versu __MONEY__ billion from them __PUNCT__
and now it is even clearer that the iraqi govern is not spend it oil monei on reconstruct __PUNCT__
there ar report that iraq spent less than a quarter of oil fund set asid for reconstruct in __NUM__ and the u. __PUNCT__ comptrol gener testifi that as of __DATE__ the capit expenditur rate for the central ministri in iraq wa onli __NUM__ __PUNCT__
oil profit ar show up in foreign bank even as iraqi citizen lack basic servic __PUNCT__
as presid i would immedi direct the inspector gener for iraq to appoint a special council to investig and make recommend directli to me for how to ensur iraqi oil revenu and u. __PUNCT__ taxpay dollar on a declin trend ar us to rebuild iraq __PUNCT__
it is unaccept that these oil revenu go unus or wors end up in privat account while citizen lack electr and clean drink water __PUNCT__
we will support iraq effort to rebuild their countri __PUNCT__ but we will not permit our monei or their to be thrown awai __PUNCT__
i will work to crack down on the black market for oil in iraq __PUNCT__
accord to recent new report __PUNCT__ insurg group a profit from a substanti black market in oil __PUNCT__
the monei thei make is go in part to pai for i __PUNCT__ car bomb __PUNCT__ and other tool of terror __PUNCT__
the iraqi govern simpli ha not done it part to crack down on thi corrupt __PUNCT__
the equat here is simpl __PUNCT__ if we cut off or disrupt these illeg sourc of fund __PUNCT__ we can deni the insurg the monei thei need to maintain their campaign of violenc __PUNCT__
so i will order a joint nationwid u.s./iraqi crackdown on black market and oil smuggler __PUNCT__
we beef up protect for oil line to prevent illeg tap and attack __PUNCT__
we will cut off illeg network __PUNCT__ identifi where the stolen oil and other good ar go __PUNCT__ who is steal them __PUNCT__ and captur those respons __PUNCT__
we will work with our intern commun to try to cut off access to the fund that hold these oil revenu __PUNCT__
and we will maintain the crackdown success by send a strong signal to the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ show result in root out corrupt or lose your aid __PUNCT__
the third and final part of my plan to end the war involv replac our militari forc in iraq with an intens diplomat initi in the region __PUNCT__
over the past four year __PUNCT__ we learn the hard wai about the need for a truli multilater approach in iraq __PUNCT__ on built on sound strategi and long __PUNCT__ rang plan __PUNCT__ not ideolog and wish think __PUNCT__
the presid go it alon strategi ha diminish our posit in the region and around the world __PUNCT__ and that diminish posit __PUNCT__ in turn __PUNCT__ ha made it increasingli difficult for us to bring about a polit solut __PUNCT__
our friend and alli in the region have an especi larg stake in build a stabl iraq __PUNCT__ but until now in part becaus of the bush administr mismanag of the war __PUNCT__ thei have lack leadership and gotten a free pass __PUNCT__
that must end __PUNCT__
ten month from now we will have a new opportun to reach out and engag our alli __PUNCT__
on of my veri first intern meet as presid would be with our treati alli and our friend in the region includ the gulf state __PUNCT__ jordan __PUNCT__ egypt __PUNCT__ and our european alli __PUNCT__
over the cours of my career i have known and work with mani of these leader alreadi __PUNCT__ and i will send them a veri clear messag __PUNCT__ what happen in iraq affect all of our interest __PUNCT__ and it is all of our respons __PUNCT__
it time we did our part and paid our fair share __PUNCT__
i will then conven a region stabil group compos of these kei alli __PUNCT__ other global parti __PUNCT__ the state border iraq __PUNCT__
the mission of thi group will be to develop and implement a strategi to creat a stabl iraq __PUNCT__
i would includ in thi region stabil group iran and syria __PUNCT__
we must convinc all countri in the region and beyond to refrain from get involv in the iraqi civil war __PUNCT__ to hold themselv and other to their past pledg to provid fund in iraq __PUNCT__ and to support the central role for the unit nation __PUNCT__
these will be critic first step toward establish a new american approach in the world __PUNCT__ on that draw on the strength of our allianc and the power of our diplomaci __PUNCT__ and us the greatest militari forc on earth as a last __PUNCT__ not a first __PUNCT__ resort __PUNCT__
achiev all of thi will not be easi __PUNCT__
but we don't have ani choic __PUNCT__
when i look at the road ahead __PUNCT__ i think about the men and women in uniform whom i had the profound honor of meet and serv __PUNCT__
our troop serv not onli in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ but across the globe __PUNCT__
our veteran recov in v.a __PUNCT__ hospit and rehabilit center here at home __PUNCT__ mani with seriou and life __PUNCT__ alter injuri __PUNCT__
the countless veteran who ar not given the support and servic thei need to reenter civilian life __PUNCT__
these men and women have made extraordinari sacrific serv the countri thei love __PUNCT__ and i alwai struck by how no matter the extent and sever of their suffer __PUNCT__ no matter how grave their own injuri __PUNCT__ thei alwai sai the same thing to me __PUNCT__ promis that you take care of my buddi __PUNCT__
