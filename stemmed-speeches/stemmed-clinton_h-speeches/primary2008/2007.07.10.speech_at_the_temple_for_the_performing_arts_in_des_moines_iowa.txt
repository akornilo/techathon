thei remov saddam hussein from power __PUNCT__ and brought him to justic __PUNCT__
thei help the citizen of iraq organ elect __PUNCT__ and vote for new leader __PUNCT__
thei gave the iraqi govern the space and time to act __PUNCT__ if thei chose to do so __PUNCT__
but over the past four year __PUNCT__ the situat in iraq ha dramat deterior __PUNCT__
the mission todai is more about polic a civil war than build a democraci __PUNCT__
our troop now serv alongsid iraqi armi offic and soldier __PUNCT__
some have their loyalti to iraq __PUNCT__
other __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ ar loyal to sectarian militia __PUNCT__ some of whom serv brave alongsid our soldier __PUNCT__

some even have taken up arm against american __PUNCT__
and our troop ar pai the price __PUNCT__
__NUM__ of them have lost their live __PUNCT__ __NUM__ from right here in iowa __PUNCT__
these past three month have been the deadliest quarter on record __PUNCT__ with __NUM__ fatal __PUNCT__
on armi chaplain told a report that he tri to read a uniqu passag from scriptur over the bodi of each soldier who ha been kill in hi unit __PUNCT__
but the casualti have been so heavi __PUNCT__ he ha nearli run out of suitabl vers __PUNCT__
then there ar the wound __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ so far __PUNCT__
mani hurt so badli __PUNCT__ thei will never fulli recov __PUNCT__
mani more with __PUNCT__ invis wound __PUNCT__ depress __PUNCT__ anxieti __PUNCT__ post traumat stress disord __PUNCT__ traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__

mani aren't get the treatment thei need __PUNCT__

some forc to explain that mom or dad is never come home __PUNCT__
our troop __PUNCT__ sacrific is their sacrific too __PUNCT__
then there is the price the iraqi have paid __PUNCT__
ten of thousand civilian __PUNCT__ and sever thousand member of the iraqi secur forc __PUNCT__ have been kill __PUNCT__
million of iraqi have fled their home __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ a month __PUNCT__ under threat of execut by sectarian militia and kidnap by crimin gang __PUNCT__
then there ar the financi cost __PUNCT__
more than __MONEY__ billion so far __PUNCT__
at the current rate of spend __PUNCT__ we could provid access to high qualiti pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten for everi four year __PUNCT__ old in america __PUNCT__ extend health care to all __NUM__ million american who ar current uninsur __PUNCT__ and make colleg more afford for more than on million student __PUNCT__
then there is our work in afghanistan __PUNCT__ yet anoth casualti of the war in iraq __PUNCT__
when i first visit there in __NUM__ i wa greet by a soldier who said __PUNCT__ welcom to the forgotten frontlin in the war against terror __PUNCT__
distract by iraq __PUNCT__ we have squander much of what our militari accomplish in afghanistan __PUNCT__ erod our posit among the afghan peopl __PUNCT__ limit the potenti of presid karzai moder govern __PUNCT__ and fail to stem the renew aggress by the taliban and al qaeda __PUNCT__
for while the bush administr ha neglect afghanistan __PUNCT__ the terrorist and drug __PUNCT__ traffick have not __PUNCT__
a recent un report found that afghanistan product of opium __PUNCT__ the raw materi for heroin __PUNCT__ increas nearli __NUM__ percent last year __PUNCT__ to a total that wa more than __NUM__ percent of the world illicit opium product in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the heroin trade financ the veri taliban fighter and al qaeda terrorist who ar attack our troop and gain new foothold in part of afghanistan __PUNCT__
the catalogu of miscalcul __PUNCT__ misjudg __PUNCT__ and mistak in iraq shock the conscienc __PUNCT__
from the unilater decis to rush to a preemptiv war without allow the inspector to finish their work or wait for diplomaci to run it cours __PUNCT__ to the failur to send enough troop or provid proper equip for them __PUNCT__ to the denial of a rise insurg and the failur to adjust the militari strategi __PUNCT__ to continu support for a govern unwil to make the necessari polit compromis __PUNCT__ to the adher to a broken polici more than four year after the invas began __PUNCT__
as a result of these failur __PUNCT__ the next presid will inherit some of the greatest foreign polici challeng in our histori __PUNCT__
rise terror and extrem __PUNCT__
frai allianc __PUNCT__
and the increasingli difficult task of restor american leadership in a world that ha come to view our nation with suspicion and mistrust __PUNCT__
we cannot effect address ani of these challeng if we continu our militari engag in iraq __PUNCT__
as long as we stai there __PUNCT__ our militari strength will continu to erod __PUNCT__
our stand in the world will continu to declin __PUNCT__
our enemi in the region will continu to exploit our failur __PUNCT__
our occup will continu to serv as a recruit tool for terrorist __PUNCT__
our support for afghan democraci __PUNCT__ our conflict with the taliban __PUNCT__ and our hunt for al qaeda will continu to be compromis __PUNCT__
and our brave men and women will continu to lose their live and suffer grievou wound __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ some of the most respect member of the presid own parti in the senat ar begin to acknowledg these realiti __PUNCT__
senat lugar __PUNCT__ rank member of the foreign relat committe __PUNCT__ and a lead voic on foreign affair for decad __PUNCT__ just recent state hi opposit to stai the cours in iraq __PUNCT__
senat voinovich and __PUNCT__ most recent __PUNCT__ senat domenici __PUNCT__ have also call on presid bush to chang cours __PUNCT__
after more than four year __PUNCT__ more than __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ and human cost beyond measur __PUNCT__ it is abundantli clear that there is no militari solut to the crisi in iraq __PUNCT__
it is long past time that the presid end american combat involv iraq multi __PUNCT__ side __PUNCT__ sectarian civil war __PUNCT__ fought for power __PUNCT__ reveng __PUNCT__ and person advantag __PUNCT__
that is what i have been try to do in the senat __PUNCT__ after call for and consist vote for phase redeploy of our troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
that is why i vote against a bill to fund the war without ani plan for end it __PUNCT__
that is why i introduc legisl to begin bring our troop home within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
and that is why i am join other democrat to add provis to the defens author bill __PUNCT__ which we ar debat in the senat thi week __PUNCT__ that would forc the presid to chang cours in iraq __PUNCT__
among those provis is legisl i am sponsor with senat robert byrd to de __PUNCT__ author the war __PUNCT__ legisl that would actual end the presid author to fight it __PUNCT__
i hope and prai that a bi __PUNCT__ partisan major of the congress will be abl to persuad or forc the presid to chang cours __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ gener david petraeu __PUNCT__ the command gener in charg of iraq __PUNCT__ will issu a report on the progress of the surg __PUNCT__
if the past is ani guid __PUNCT__ the presid mai still decid to maintain hi fail strategi __PUNCT__ regardless of what the report sai __PUNCT__ just as he reject the thought recommend of the bi __PUNCT__ partisan iraq studi group __PUNCT__
if that happen __PUNCT__ if the presid refus to end thi war befor he leav offic __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__ quickli __PUNCT__ respons __PUNCT__ and in a wai that will restor __PUNCT__ not weaken __PUNCT__ america leadership in the world __PUNCT__
thi will be my first and most import mission as presid __PUNCT__ on i believ i have the strength and experi to complet __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i want to lai out my three point plan for how i would achiev thi __PUNCT__ how __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i would bring our troop home __PUNCT__ work to bring stabil to the region __PUNCT__ and replac a militari forc with a new diplomat initi to engag countri around the world in secur iraq futur and america nation secur interest __PUNCT__
the most import part of my plan is the first step __PUNCT__ to end our militari engag in iraq civil war and immedi start bring our troop home as quickli and carefulli as possibl __PUNCT__
no perman occup of the countri __PUNCT__
no more neighborhood patrol __PUNCT__
no more be caught in the middl of a war whose side we do not even know we should be on __PUNCT__
at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ the iraqi ar respons for iraq futur __PUNCT__
and if we have learn anyth these past four year __PUNCT__ it that we cannot successfulli polic a civil war __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ keep our troop in the crossfir of sectarian violenc is not the answer __PUNCT__
bring them home swiftli and respons is __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will conven the joint chief of staff __PUNCT__ my secretari of defens and my nation secur council and direct them to draw up a clear __PUNCT__ viabl plan to bring our troop home start within the first __NUM__ dai of my administr __PUNCT__
we should do thi as quickli as we can __PUNCT__ consist with preserv our secur and protect our troop __PUNCT__
i have been long worri that the pentagon is not adequ plan for the withdraw of our troop becaus the white hous doe not want them to plan for withdraw __PUNCT__
i have written the secretari of defens as well as the chairman of the joint chief of staff __PUNCT__ and ask them to pleas let us know in congress what plan thei have __PUNCT__
withdraw troop is danger and difficult __PUNCT__
especi when we will have to convoi our troop and their equip out of iraq along the veri same road that ar boobi __PUNCT__ trap with explos devic __PUNCT__
it requir enorm care and precis __PUNCT__ and i hope we will start that process befor i presid __PUNCT__
we should redeploi our troop steadili and consist __PUNCT__ not in fit and start __PUNCT__
and as we bring our troop home __PUNCT__ we must ensur that we ar fulli prepar to care for them __PUNCT__ and their famili __PUNCT__ onc thei have return __PUNCT__
so as the joint chief and defens secretari ar draw up a redeploy plan __PUNCT__ i will direct the depart of defens and the depart of veteran affair to prepar a comprehens plan to provid the highest qualiti health care __PUNCT__ disabl benefit __PUNCT__ and social servic for everi singl servicememb __PUNCT__ includ everi member of the nation guard and reserv __PUNCT__
and i will make sure thi plan is promptli implement __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we ar not provid the care our veteran deserv __PUNCT__
we have all heard the heartbreak stori about soldier languish in filthi __PUNCT__ decrepit facil __PUNCT__
the facil at walter reed were a disgrac which our presid recent refer to as __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ some bureaucrat red __PUNCT__ tape issu __PUNCT__
but sadli __PUNCT__ the walter reed scandal is just the tip of a nasti iceberg __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we have veteran across america who struggl with traumat brain injuri and other wound __PUNCT__ and ar told to take a number and wait in line for month __PUNCT__
veteran try to get disabl pai ar run into a wall of indiffer from their own govern __PUNCT__
militari famili try to get life insur benefit thei ar entitl to ar drown in delai and reject __PUNCT__
when our young men and women put on our countri uniform __PUNCT__ when thei go into harm wai for our american famili __PUNCT__ thei ar our son and daughter and it past time we start treat them that wai __PUNCT__
that what i tri to do in the senat __PUNCT__ by expand health care for our nation guard and reserv member __PUNCT__ sponsor legisl to increas militari survivor benefit from __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ author the hero at home legisl to help servicememb and their famili deal with post traumat stress disord and traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i propos guarante fund for our va health care system __PUNCT__
and a gi bill of right for the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri to help veteran bui their own home __PUNCT__ build their own busi __PUNCT__ attend colleg and get the train thei need for good __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__
the second part of my plan involv work to secur stabil within iraq as we bring our troop home __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern is fail it citizen __PUNCT__
govern offici refus to take the step need to advanc a polit solut __PUNCT__ improv the economi and better the live of ordinari iraqi __PUNCT__
thei refus to do their part to quell sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ and some have even chosen to particip in it __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will focu american aid effort dure our redeploy on stabil iraq __PUNCT__ not prop up the iraqi govern __PUNCT__
financi resourc will onli go where thei will be us properli __PUNCT__
we will no longer funnel monei to those govern ministri and minist that hoard it __PUNCT__ seal it __PUNCT__ or wast it __PUNCT__
if __PUNCT__ by the time i take offic __PUNCT__ iraq central govern ha proven that it commit to rebuild the countri and strive for sustain stabil and polit reconcili __PUNCT__ we send aid to that govern __PUNCT__
if not __PUNCT__ we consid provid aid to provinci govern and reliabl non __PUNCT__ government organ that ar make progress __PUNCT__
i will also urg the appoint of a high level u.n __PUNCT__ repres __PUNCT__ similar to those appoint in afghanistan __PUNCT__ bosnia and kosovo __PUNCT__ to help broker peac among the parti in iraq __PUNCT__
thi repres will press the iraqi to achiev defin polit object that will help iraqi build a stake in their countri __PUNCT__ includ __PUNCT__ most importantli __PUNCT__ the equit distribut of oil revenu __PUNCT__ so that everyon get their fair share __PUNCT__ and ordinari iraqi start feel like thei have a stake in the countri futur __PUNCT__
i have promot the idea of an oil __PUNCT__ trust for more than three year becaus i believ it would help convinc iraqi that thei will benefit from a stabl iraq more than the continu sectarian conflict __PUNCT__
i tri to get the bush administr to adopt thi idea which we did in alaska __PUNCT__
when alaska wa discov to have oil __PUNCT__ everi alaskan get check so everi alaskan ha a stake in make sure that the pipelin is safe and that the process continu __PUNCT__
and i believ it would have made such a differ immedi if the unit state when we were still the occupi power had creat such an oil __PUNCT__ trust __PUNCT__
i told that my idea which didn't have republican support got as far as the vice presid offic where a lot of good idea appar die __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ as we redeploi our troop __PUNCT__ we will replac our militari forc in iraq with an intens __PUNCT__ diplomat initi in the region __PUNCT__
to bring about long __PUNCT__ term stabil in iraq and prevent violenc and unrest from spill over to other part of the area __PUNCT__ on of the most danger part of the world to begin with __PUNCT__
thi will be a first step toward restor american moral and strateg leadership in the world __PUNCT__ on that draw on the strength of our allianc and the power of our diplomaci __PUNCT__ and us militari forc as a last __PUNCT__ not a first __PUNCT__ resort __PUNCT__
over the past four year __PUNCT__ we have learn the hard wai about the need for a truli multilater approach in iraq __PUNCT__ on built on sound strategi and long __PUNCT__ rang plan __PUNCT__ not ideolog and wish think __PUNCT__
the presid go __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ alon attitud ha diminish our posit in the region and around the world __PUNCT__
and our diminish posit __PUNCT__ in turn __PUNCT__ ha made it increasingli difficult for us to bring about a polit solut in iraq __PUNCT__
our relationship with turkei is just on exampl __PUNCT__
six year ago __PUNCT__ at the end of the clinton administr __PUNCT__ support for the u. __PUNCT__ in turkei __PUNCT__ a longtim alli in nato __PUNCT__ stood at over __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ accord to a recent pew studi __PUNCT__ it at just nine percent __PUNCT__
thi is the most spectacular deterior of relat with a treati alli in memori __PUNCT__
so we dug ourselv into a pretti deep hole __PUNCT__ haven't we __PUNCT__ but i am confid we can dig ourselv out __PUNCT__
i believ we can return to a foreign polici through which __PUNCT__ as my friend __PUNCT__ former secretari of state madelein albright onc said __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ cooper with other whenev we can and act alon onli when we have to __PUNCT__
not the other wai around __PUNCT__
i believ we can restor our stand in the world __PUNCT__ and begin to restor stabil in iraq __PUNCT__ by restor our us of meaning diplomaci in the region __PUNCT__
that start with draw down our troop and draw upon the intern commun to make a commit to iraq futur __PUNCT__
so in my first dai in offic __PUNCT__ i begin work to conven a region stabil group compos of kei alli __PUNCT__ other global power __PUNCT__ and all of the state border iraq __PUNCT__
the mission of thi group will be to develop and implement a strategi to creat a stabl iraq __PUNCT__
work with the unit nation repres __PUNCT__ the group will first work to convinc iran __PUNCT__ saudi arabia __PUNCT__ turkei __PUNCT__ and syria to refrain from get involv in the civil war __PUNCT__ either directli or indirectli __PUNCT__ by back local milit and militia __PUNCT__
none of these countri benefit if iraq implod and the result chao spill over their border __PUNCT__
although i believ our militari disengag will reduc the likelihood of region interfer in iraq intern affair over the long run __PUNCT__ i acknowledg that in the short run __PUNCT__ there mai well be increas violenc and instabl follow our troop withdraw __PUNCT__
in bosnia __PUNCT__ befor the us __PUNCT__ led nato action result in the dayton peac accord __PUNCT__ the sectarian violenc claim __NUM__ live and creat two million refuge __PUNCT__
and iraq ha six time as mani peopl __PUNCT__
so unless the leader of the variou insurg group __PUNCT__ and militia and the govern chang cours __PUNCT__ thei could reach the per capit bosnian casualti rate __PUNCT__ claim hundr of thousand more iraqi live and caus million more to flee __PUNCT__
thi tragic possibl __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ doe not justifi continu our fail polici __PUNCT__ but it doe intensifi the import of the other element of my plan __PUNCT__
the u.n __PUNCT__ led group will attempt to mediat among the differ sectarian group in iraq with the goal of attain compromis on fundament issu like the structur of their new govern __PUNCT__ the contour of their econom polici __PUNCT__ and a system for divid their oil revenu __PUNCT__
thi will no doubt be difficult __PUNCT__
but achiev agreement on issu like these is a critic step for build a stabl futur for iraq __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ the member of the group will hold themselv and other countri to their past pledg to provid fund to iraq __PUNCT__
and thei encourag addit contribut to meet iraq extens need __PUNCT__
as it stand now __PUNCT__ the unit state is shoulder far too great a share of the financi burden for rebuild iraq __PUNCT__
as of __DATE__ foreign donor had made good on onli about __NUM__ billion dollar of the __NUM__ billion in pledg from the madrid confer __PUNCT__
some wealthi gulf nation have come up especi short __PUNCT__
countri around the world also have a stake in iraq futur __PUNCT__ and thei should contribut to secur it __PUNCT__
let me sai a word about the place of iran and syria in thi new __PUNCT__ diplomat initi __PUNCT__
there is no question that these two regim ar among the most difficult and danger in the world __PUNCT__
thei pose direct threat to their neighbor __PUNCT__ to israel __PUNCT__ our strateg alli and friend __PUNCT__ and far beyond the region __PUNCT__
iran presid ha host a confer devot to deni the holocaust __PUNCT__ place him in compani with the most despic bigot and histor revisionist __PUNCT__
and both countri sponsor terror __PUNCT__ directli __PUNCT__ and indirectli through hezbollah and hama __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ for most of the past six year __PUNCT__ presid bush ha adopt a simpl and fundament flaw strategi for deal with these countri __PUNCT__ we don't talk to bad peopl __PUNCT__
i think you agre with me that we strongli disagre with thi approach __PUNCT__
even dure the cold war __PUNCT__ we never stop speak to the soviet union __PUNCT__
even when thei had thousand of missil point at us __PUNCT__
even when their leader threaten to buri us __PUNCT__
even when thei were invad countri and incit militari upris around the world __PUNCT__
that wa the smart polici __PUNCT__ on embrac by both democrat and republican __PUNCT__
we know thi approach can be as effect now as it wa back then __PUNCT__
look what happen when the administr __PUNCT__ after six year of neglect dure which north korea built up it nuclear program __PUNCT__ final pursu aggress __PUNCT__ face __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ face talk with north korea __PUNCT__
we got them to agre to suspend their nuclear weapon program __PUNCT__ and we didn't have to sacrific a singl american life to achiev that goal __PUNCT__
we end the genocid and ethnic cleans in the balkan without sacrif a singl american life __PUNCT__
the administr should learn from the progress made in north korea and take a similar approach toward iran and syria __PUNCT__
while thei did meet recent with iranian offici __PUNCT__ thei now appear reluct to continu that effort __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will deal with syria and iran right from the begin __PUNCT__ we will engag them in open __PUNCT__ frank __PUNCT__ tough __PUNCT__ mind discuss about the statu of iraq __PUNCT__
and we will convei our strong __PUNCT__ bi __PUNCT__ partisan posit that iran cannot be allow obtain nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me be clear __PUNCT__ engag doe not mean a warm embrac __PUNCT__
i have no illus about iran and syria __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ we must also be realist __PUNCT__
diplomaci is difficult and time __PUNCT__ consum __PUNCT__
it is frustrat at time __PUNCT__ and it mai not bear fruit __PUNCT__
but it is the best tool we have __PUNCT__ given the challeng we face __PUNCT__
as we ar leav iraq __PUNCT__ and after we have left __PUNCT__ we need to engag the world in a global humanitarian effort to confront the human cost creat by thi war __PUNCT__
that is the final compon of our diplomat initi __PUNCT__
sinc the start of the war __PUNCT__ two million iraqi have fled their countri __PUNCT__ mainli to jordan and syria __PUNCT__ and two million more have been displac from their home and neighborhood within iraq __PUNCT__
mani ar live in desper condit __PUNCT__ creat not just a humanitarian crisi __PUNCT__ but on with strateg __PUNCT__ secur consequ for the region __PUNCT__
that could becom a direct threat to us __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will organ a multi __PUNCT__ billion dollar intern effort __PUNCT__ fund by a wide rang of donor state __PUNCT__ under the unit nation high commission for refuge __PUNCT__ unhcr __PUNCT__
through thi initi __PUNCT__ the commission for refuge will direct aid to build infrastructur and creat a social safeti net in jordan __PUNCT__ syria and other countri that have taken in refuge __PUNCT__
thi monei will go to school __PUNCT__ hospit and hous __PUNCT__ along with initi to creat job and promot econom develop __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ the commission for refuge will be empow to address the need of iraqi who have been displac from their home by the violenc __PUNCT__ but remain insid their countri __PUNCT__
these effort will confront the challeng pose by larg __PUNCT__ scale refuge camp in jordan __PUNCT__ which could destabil that countri and the region __PUNCT__
for what we spend in just on month on thi war __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion dollar __PUNCT__ plu __PUNCT__ the world can fund thi refuge initi for an entir year and then some __PUNCT__
these fund will help ensur a long term solut __PUNCT__ on that address the fundament need of refuge __PUNCT__ rather than resort to the limit and often counter __PUNCT__ product solut of refuge camp __PUNCT__
i stress that becaus we have to be veri care __PUNCT__ not to creat cauldron of distress and outrag __PUNCT__ by put these peopl into these refuge camp and leav them there __PUNCT__
while we will focu our effort on improv condit so that iraqi don't have to flee in the first place __PUNCT__ we will also recogn our moral oblig to help those we have put at risk in iraq __PUNCT__ the interpret __PUNCT__ the soldier and the worker who have assist our troop __PUNCT__
i have been to iraq three time __PUNCT__
i have met these great peopl who cast their bond with america __PUNCT__
mani of them have been assassin and member of their famili as well __PUNCT__
i believ we ow an oblig __PUNCT__ particularli to them __PUNCT__
so as part of thi global humanitarian effort __PUNCT__ govern in both the middl east and the west as well as here in the unit state __PUNCT__ have to take in asylum seeker __PUNCT__ with the commission of refuge develop a plan to help them return to iraq onc the countri ha stabil __PUNCT__
engag in thi humanitarian effort will not requir continu militari involv on our part __PUNCT__
just the opposit __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__
we need to redeploi our troop out of iraq befor we can undertak thi diplomat initi with ani hope for success __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ as we do bring our troop home __PUNCT__ we cannot lose sight of our veri real strateg nation interest in thi region __PUNCT__
if __PUNCT__ in the futur __PUNCT__ iraq becom a breed ground for export terrorist __PUNCT__ as it appear it alreadi is __PUNCT__ as we ar learn about those who plan and tri to carri out the attack in london __PUNCT__
that is a great worri for our countri __PUNCT__
so as we redeploi our troop from iraq __PUNCT__ i will not let down my guard against terror __PUNCT__
i will devot the resourc we need to fight it and fight it smartli __PUNCT__
i will order special unit to engag in narrow and target oper against al qaeda and other terrorist organ in the region __PUNCT__
thei will also provid secur for u. __PUNCT__ troop and personnel and train and equip iraqi secur servic to keep order and promot stabil in the countri __PUNCT__ but onli to the extent we believ such train is actual work __PUNCT__
i would also consid __PUNCT__ as i have said befor __PUNCT__ leav some forc in the kurdish area to protect the fragil but real democraci and rel peac and secur that ha develop there __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i will work to ensur a stabl and peac relationship between turkei and the kurd in northern iraq __PUNCT__ both of whom ar our friend and alli __PUNCT__
we must not permit a conflict between these two alli to becom anoth consequ of the iraq war __PUNCT__
our effort must also involv a region recommit to success in afghanistan __PUNCT__
the taliban is resurg __PUNCT__ thei and their al qaeda alli must not succe __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will not allow us to fail in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we simpli cannot allow al qaeda to reclaim the countri as it safe haven or the taliban to re __PUNCT__ establish it repress regim __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ will ani of thi be easi __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
it go to take tremend disciplin __PUNCT__ patienc and hard work __PUNCT__
but i believ it can be done __PUNCT__
i believ we can be a lot smarter about get out of thi war than we were about get into it __PUNCT__
the futur of our nation secur and intern stand depend upon it __PUNCT__
and we ow our troop __PUNCT__ and their famili __PUNCT__ noth less __PUNCT__
