so __PUNCT__ thi race isn't over yet __PUNCT__
neither of us ha the total deleg it take to win and both senat obama and i believ that the deleg from florida and michigan should be seat __PUNCT__
i believ we should honor the vote cast by __NUM__ million peopl in those state and seat all of their deleg __PUNCT__
under the rule of our parti __PUNCT__ when you includ all __NUM__ state __PUNCT__ the number of deleg need to win is __NUM__ and neither of us ha reach that threshold yet __PUNCT__
thi win in west virginia will help me move even closer __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in a campaign __PUNCT__ it can be easi to get lost in the polit spin and the poll or the punditri __PUNCT__ but we must never lose sight of what realli count __PUNCT__ of why all of us care so much about who win and who lose in our polit system __PUNCT__
