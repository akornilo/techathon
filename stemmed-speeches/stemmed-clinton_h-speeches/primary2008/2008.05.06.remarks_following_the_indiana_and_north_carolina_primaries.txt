thi is a veri touch moment for me __PUNCT__
i grew up in the midwest __PUNCT__ born in chicago __PUNCT__ rais in park ridg __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__
my dad wa a world war ii vet who start hi own small busi __PUNCT__ and origin from scranton __PUNCT__ pa __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
my mother had a difficult childhood __PUNCT__ but work hard to provid a love home for us __PUNCT__
and she didn't attend colleg herself __PUNCT__ but wa determin her children would __PUNCT__
and i don't think she ever dream she would see a night like thi __PUNCT__
their stori __PUNCT__ like everi on of our stori __PUNCT__ is the american stori __PUNCT__
it a stori of men and women who embrac opportun __PUNCT__ never waver in the face of advers __PUNCT__ and never stop believ in the promis of america __PUNCT__
and yet todai __PUNCT__ i have met so mani peopl here in indiana and across america who feel invis __PUNCT__
you sure feel invis when you pai __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ to fill up your tank __PUNCT__
you feel invis when the monei you took to the groceri store no longer meet your need for the next week __PUNCT__
you feel invis when your health insur disappear and colleg is out of reach __PUNCT__
and you can't believ how invis you feel when your love on who serv our countri in war is ill __PUNCT__ serv back at home __PUNCT__
i know these stori and i see you and i hear you __PUNCT__
and i know how hard you work __PUNCT__ work for yourselv and work for your famili __PUNCT__
and i will never stop fight for you __PUNCT__ so that you can have the futur you deserv __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ hoosier have said that you do want a presid who stand strong for you __PUNCT__ a presid who is readi on dai on to take charg as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief and keep our famili safe __PUNCT__ a presid who know how to make thi economi work for hardwork middl class famili __PUNCT__
and there ar a lot of idea about how best to do that __PUNCT__
becaus we need all of the good common sens that american have to offer __PUNCT__
i know that we have got an import debat go on right now about how we ar go to help famili deal with these ga price __PUNCT__
thei have gone up so fast __PUNCT__ so out of sight in the mind of the peopl that i talk with and i think it time that we realli had a concert strategi __PUNCT__

and i sai it time to freez foreclosur for famili most at risk of lose their home __PUNCT__ includ our soldier who ar in harm wai and ar be foreclos on here in america __PUNCT__
fundament __PUNCT__ i believ that american need a champion in their corner __PUNCT__ that for too long we had a presid who ha stood up and spoke out for the wealthi and the well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__
but i don't think that what american need or what thei look for now __PUNCT__
