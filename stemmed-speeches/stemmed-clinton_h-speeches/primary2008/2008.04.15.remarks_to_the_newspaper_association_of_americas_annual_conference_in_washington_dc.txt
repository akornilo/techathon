it wa a lesson about the still veri profound power of the tradit press to both serv and shape the public interest __PUNCT__
but it wa also a remind of the consequ of presidenti power misappli __PUNCT__ misdirect or miss in action __PUNCT__
and that what i would like to discuss with you todai __PUNCT__ the power and promis of the presid __PUNCT__
and i like to begin at the begin __PUNCT__
our constitut instruct the presid to take care that the law be faithfulli execut and call upon the presid to swear to preserv __PUNCT__ protect and defend the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__
the presid is not royalti __PUNCT__
our constitut is craft carefulli to prevent by elect what our founder overthrew by revolut __PUNCT__
the presid is the on elect repres of the whole american peopl __PUNCT__
our presid is balanc by the congress __PUNCT__ which speak for region and state __PUNCT__ and by the court __PUNCT__ which defend the individu and other import right against assault on our liberti __PUNCT__
the presid is the onli constitut offic holder with the power to speak for all of us and with the potenti to unifi us in the servic of our nation interest __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ our current presid doe not seem to understand the basic charact of the offic he hold __PUNCT__
rather than faithfulli execut the law __PUNCT__ he ha rewritten them through sign statement __PUNCT__ ignor them through secret legal opinion __PUNCT__ undermin them by elev ideolog over fact __PUNCT__
rather than defend the constitut __PUNCT__ he ha defi it principl and tradit __PUNCT__
he ha abus hi power while fail to understand it purpos __PUNCT__
thi administr unbridl ambit to transform the execut into an imperi presid in an attempt to strengthen the offic ha weaken our nation __PUNCT__
it ha corrupt and corrod our moral author and brought our prestig and reput to it lowest ebb __PUNCT__
the presid ha fail to us the power of the presid __PUNCT__ the power he sought to inflat __PUNCT__ to expand opportun and make a real differ in peopl live __PUNCT__
thi presid seem to believ it a good dai in the white hous when the govern doe littl for ordinari american __PUNCT__
that is how thi administr defin the presid __PUNCT__ limit govern __PUNCT__ but unlimit power __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i have a differ view __PUNCT__
i believ in the power of the presid to set big goal for america and to solv the problem of american __PUNCT__ to ensur that our peopl have the tool thei need to turn challeng into opportun __PUNCT__ to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__ and to build better live for themselv and their children __PUNCT__
that the kind of presid i will be everi dai in the white hous __PUNCT__ whether the issu is health care or child care __PUNCT__ foreign polici __PUNCT__ or the futur of our economi __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i believ in the promis of america and i believ in the power of the presid to help fulfil that promis __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that not a sound bite __PUNCT__
it what i have learn __PUNCT__ experienc and intend __PUNCT__ as best i could __PUNCT__ throughout my life __PUNCT__
i had mani opportun __PUNCT__
i been bless __PUNCT__
and i understand that those bless came from the hard work of my parent __PUNCT__ my teacher __PUNCT__ other in the villag that surround and help to nurtur and rais me __PUNCT__ my church __PUNCT__ which help to guid me __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the posit action of my govern that directli affect my life __PUNCT__
as a young girl __PUNCT__ i could not go to certain colleg __PUNCT__ compet for certain scholarship __PUNCT__ particip __PUNCT__ if i had the sport abil __PUNCT__ in certain sport __PUNCT__ or obtain some kind of financi aid for plai them __PUNCT__
there were certain job that were close to me and other young women __PUNCT__
and the horizon were not quit as broad as those for my brother __PUNCT__
i grew up in a middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__ at a time when our nation wa invest in the middl class __PUNCT__
after world war ii __PUNCT__ my father start a small busi __PUNCT__ save up enough monei to purchas a home __PUNCT__
he __PUNCT__ like so mani veteran come back from world war ii __PUNCT__ were anxiou to get on with their live __PUNCT__
he move us to a suburb where he paid tax for better school __PUNCT__ and where our nation made unpreced invest in public educ __PUNCT__
i wa abl to go to colleg and then to law school becaus the feder govern want to make invest in young peopl __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ when i went to law school __PUNCT__ unabl to get ani financi help from my famili __PUNCT__ i work __PUNCT__ i had a small scholarship __PUNCT__ and i borrow monei from the feder govern at about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
and i and so mani other had a chanc to pursu our academ dream becaus our govern want us to __PUNCT__
as i have seen over the last year in public life as a senat from new york and now as a candid for the presid how mani famili and how mani young peopl don't have ani confid or ani reason to believ that their govern care about their futur __PUNCT__
i believ that we have to chang that __PUNCT__
the magnitud of the problem be fore us present a uniqu challeng and chanc to bring thi gener of american togeth __PUNCT__ to fulfil our common purpos __PUNCT__
and find the nation to do so is the respons of our presid __PUNCT__
nine month from now __PUNCT__ a few dai __PUNCT__ we will have a new presid take the oath of offic from the step of the capitol __PUNCT__
that new presid will inherit the job at a time of unpreced challeng and stress __PUNCT__
our economi is at risk of a deep and pain recess threaten the opportun for million of american to fond and keep job that ar satisfi and well paid __PUNCT__ to bui their own home or keep the on thei have __PUNCT__ send their children to colleg __PUNCT__ to save for retir __PUNCT__ even to afford their health care premium __PUNCT__ their ga bill __PUNCT__ their util bill __PUNCT__ and so much els that make up a middl class lifestyl here in our countri __PUNCT__
our health care system is in crisi __PUNCT__
it threaten not onli the health of our famili but the opportun for our busi as thei compet in the global marketplac __PUNCT__
our secur is threaten by the interconnect danger of extrem __PUNCT__ terror __PUNCT__ rogu regim __PUNCT__ and the prolifer of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ and certainli by the ongo war in iraq and the climat crisi that doe threaten our wai of life __PUNCT__
that why it is so import that in thi elect we restor balanc and purpos to the presid as the first step to restor opportun and moral author in america __PUNCT__
i believ i bring a uniqu set of experi to thi mission __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ of my lifetim of work go back __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and my incred opportun now on both end of pennsylvania avenu __PUNCT__
i have seen what happen when a presid tri and succe on some front __PUNCT__ but fail on other __PUNCT__
i certainli wit and wa part of the consequ of a process to creat univers health care that wa view as too insul from peopl and their repres in congress __PUNCT__
but i also particip in and help to bring about success __PUNCT__ like the children health insur program which wa a bipartisan accomplish __PUNCT__
i watch as my husband made other import progress step on behalf of america __PUNCT__
as a senat __PUNCT__ i seen how work with congress as a presid make a real differ __PUNCT__ and the absenc of presidenti involv leav a vacuum __PUNCT__
congress role in deliber on legisl mai not alwai bring peopl togeth who do not agre __PUNCT__ but it is essenti that the process be recogn and respect __PUNCT__
i have work hard to hold thi administr account becaus all too often the presid ha fail to share inform with the congress __PUNCT__ to be will to recogn the check and balanc that have certainli been a bless to our system of govern for so mani year __PUNCT__
i will bring most of my time in the white hous and now my time in the senat __PUNCT__ some critic lesson to the presid __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i will restor faith in our govern by resort integr to our govern __PUNCT__
for seven year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha exhibit ideolog disdain for govern __PUNCT__
and becaus thei view govern with contempt __PUNCT__ thei treat it with contempt __PUNCT__
thei don't believ govern can or should be a sourc for the public interest __PUNCT__ so thei treat it as a sourc of favor for privat interest __PUNCT__
as presid i will restor an old __PUNCT__ fashion idea __PUNCT__ appoint qualifi peopl to posit in govern again __PUNCT__
i will immedi begin implement an agenda of reform to end no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ to close the revolv door between public sector work and privat sector lobbi __PUNCT__ to restor fiscal respons __PUNCT__ to modern our govern __PUNCT__ and to open it book to greater scrutini __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i will restor open in govern __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ the era of bush/chenei secreci will be over __PUNCT__
on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ presid kennedi address on of the predecessor of thi associ __PUNCT__ the american newspap publish associ __PUNCT__
the fail invas of cuba known as the bai of pig had taken place just on week befor __PUNCT__
presid kennedi spoke of the threat threaten the unit state __PUNCT__
he wrestl publicli with the basic tension that exist whenev our secur is threaten between the govern respons to keep some secret and the public right to know __PUNCT__
but he understood the import of open to the integr and vital of govern even in the aftermath of hi own failur __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ there is littl valu in oppos the threat of a close societi by imit it arbitrari restrict __PUNCT__
just dai after an embarrass failur __PUNCT__ the presid of the unit state came befor your predecessor __PUNCT__ beg for scrutini __PUNCT__ and challeng the nation to mobil without compromis democrat valu __PUNCT__
that kind of open leadership ha been sore lack these past seven year __PUNCT__
in fact the bush administr ha dramat widen the definit of classifi inform to shield more and more materi from public scrutini __PUNCT__ ha widen the scope of the state secret privileg to shield thi program from judici review __PUNCT__ and ha widen the reach of execut privileg to shield it activ from congress __PUNCT__
from warrantless wiretap at home to secret prison oversea __PUNCT__ the bush administr ha conduct illeg activ and stonewal effort of the peopl and the congress to discov them and to hold the administr account __PUNCT__
when i am presid i will empow the feder govern to oper from a presumpt of open __PUNCT__ not secreci __PUNCT__
that why i am a co __PUNCT__ sponsor of the free flow of inform act __PUNCT__ allow report to protect sourc __PUNCT__ help insur that whistl blower can blow the whistl __PUNCT__ and you can keep the public inform and keep offic holder account __PUNCT__
i will direct my administr to prevent needless classif of inform that ought to be share with the public __PUNCT__
we will adopt a presumpt of open and freedom of inform act request and urg agenc to releas inform quickli if disclosur will do no harm __PUNCT__
it wa attornei gener janet reno approach __PUNCT__ and it will be my attornei gener approach __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ becaus solv problem start by recogn fact __PUNCT__ i will restor evid base decis make to our govern __PUNCT__
a free and open societi depend upon evid base inquiri __PUNCT__
shortli after i arriv in the senat __PUNCT__ it becam abundantli clear to me that the white hous had veri littl interest in fact or evid and i start sai in speech on the floor and in other set that thei want to turn washington into an evid __PUNCT__ free zone __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ thei have succeed all too well and we will have to revers that __PUNCT__
thi administr ha also wage a war on scienc __PUNCT__ rewrit scientif report __PUNCT__ allow politician to overrul and silenc govern research __PUNCT__ politic import decis affect our environ and our public health __PUNCT__
i will stop polit appointe from manipul the govern scientif conclus and prevent the suppress of public statement from govern scientist __PUNCT__
i will put in place new whistleblow protect for scientist who step forward to protest polit interfer __PUNCT__
our govern will onc again valu and encourag scientif discoveri and open inquiri __PUNCT__ and we will regain our place as the world lead innov nation __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ becaus govern abus is check by the separ of power __PUNCT__ i will restor respect for our co __PUNCT__ equal branch of govern __PUNCT__
i start by limit the excess execut power thi presid ha accumul __PUNCT__ like the unilater power to wiretap __PUNCT__ or detain try peopl __PUNCT__ even american citizen __PUNCT__
i will work with congress again as a partner to solv problem __PUNCT__
i end the us of sign statement to rewrit the law that congress ha pass __PUNCT__
i shut down guantanamo __PUNCT__ disavow tortur and restor the right of habea corpu __PUNCT__
i will end the practic of us execut privileg as a shield against the public right to know and congress __PUNCT__ duti to overse the presid __PUNCT__
final i will make crystal clear that the presid and the execut branch will compli with the law of our nation __PUNCT__
my depart of justic will interpret those law fairli accur honestli and public __PUNCT__
we releas justic depart interpret so that you know exactli what our understand is and how law ar be execut __PUNCT__
the presid is not abov the law in our system of govern and we need to make that absolut clear start next year __PUNCT__
these chang both repres and drive the transform i believ is need in our govern start on dai on of my administr __PUNCT__
i do not believ that power is an end in itself but a mean __PUNCT__
a mean limit in scope of serv the interest and protect the safeti of our nation __PUNCT__ while creat opportun for our peopl __PUNCT__
but the question befor us is deeper than how the next presid will restor our govern and our constitut __PUNCT__
the question is how the next presid will emploi our govern __PUNCT__
i am here and i am run for presid becaus i have seen the promis of america and i do understand the promis of the presid and on dai on i will bring my hard won experi __PUNCT__ whatev strength and knowledg i poss to fulfil that promis __PUNCT__
i will start by try to live up to the model describ by teddi roosevelt __PUNCT__ all that in me li to do will be done to make my work a success __PUNCT__

in short __PUNCT__ start from dai on __PUNCT__ the bush __PUNCT__ chenei era will be over in name and in practic __PUNCT__
we ar fortun in our countri that we get to overturn our govern peacefulli and thoroughli __PUNCT__
the question is the path we select at such an import junctur __PUNCT__
i know thi campaign ha gone on a long time __PUNCT__ but elect do end and when the campaign conclud and the banner ar town down and the speech ar final finish __PUNCT__ all that left is the choic we have made __PUNCT__
we have seen the power of the presid place in hand unreadi or unwil to address the path that lie ahead __PUNCT__
ju think of the dai after __DATE__ __PUNCT__
imagin if presid bush had tap into the wellspr of american energi __PUNCT__ initi and goodwil __PUNCT__
the presid could launch a manhattan project for renew energi __PUNCT__ the presid could have call on our young peopl to serv in the peac corp or americorp help to start what i advoc __PUNCT__ a green corp __PUNCT__
the presid could said we need to reach out to the rest of the world becaus clearli the world need to be as commit to end act of horrif terror as we ar __PUNCT__
the presid could have respond to our health challeng by invest in public health here and around the world __PUNCT__

the presid liter could have access to do anyth __PUNCT__ call on our patriot and our uniti __PUNCT__
but he onli ask us to draw on our wallet and go shop __PUNCT__
we have also seen throughout our histori the power of the presid place in hand readi to transform our nation for the better __PUNCT__ to call upon those better angel of our natur __PUNCT__ to summon the uniqu and wonder spirit that set america apart and carri forward __PUNCT__ constantli believ that tomorrow can be better than todai __PUNCT__

throughout our histori we have achiev in those moment improb and even imposs triumph __PUNCT__
and each time we have rediscov the boundless forc of american strength and charact __PUNCT__
that is what we must do again __PUNCT__
in a messag to congress from the citizen of america at the onset of the civil war __PUNCT__ presid lincoln call upon our nation to save itself __PUNCT__
