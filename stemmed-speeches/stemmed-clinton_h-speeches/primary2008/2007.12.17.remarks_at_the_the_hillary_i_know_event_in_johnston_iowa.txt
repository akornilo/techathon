but we weren't success that first time __PUNCT__

over the opposit of the pentagon and the opposit of the white hous __PUNCT__ we pass health care for guard and reserv member __PUNCT__ like so mani who have left here from iowa __PUNCT__

you will be abl to have new choic __PUNCT__
i want to open up the congression plan to everi american __PUNCT__
it a good plan __PUNCT__

everi feder employe ha access to thi plan and you pai for it becaus you pai the bulk of it __PUNCT__ becaus it is paid for out of tax dollar __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of it __PUNCT__
i figur if it good enough for member of congress __PUNCT__ it good enough for everi american to have those same choic at the same afford cost __PUNCT__
we go to help peopl who have a littl troubl afford it with health care tax credit __PUNCT__
