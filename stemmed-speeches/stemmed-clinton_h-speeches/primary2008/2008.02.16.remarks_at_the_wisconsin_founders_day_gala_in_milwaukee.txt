i work as the chair of the legal servic corpor __PUNCT__ appoint by presid carter to expand legal servic for the poor across our nation becaus i had a passion commit to equal justic under the law __PUNCT__
in arkansa i reform the educ system so that children in the poorest commun in the delta or in the inner citi would have some shot at find out what thei could do if thei were motiv and would work hard __PUNCT__
and in the white hous year we tackl a lot of tough problem __PUNCT__ and on that i work on and help to make progress on wa to creat the children health insur program __PUNCT__ to give six million kid across our countri a chanc to have health care __PUNCT__
as i wa shake hand in the crowd after my event todai in kenosha __PUNCT__ a woman held up a sign and said __PUNCT__ thank you for save my daughter life __PUNCT__

then i met a young boi name jacob who ha cerebr palsi but he is do realli well __PUNCT__
he wa stand between hi two proud parent __PUNCT__

dure the town hall __PUNCT__ i call on a littl girl __PUNCT__
she said __PUNCT__ what ar you go to do for peopl who don't have home __PUNCT__ i thought like mani children that i talk to across america that the plight of the homeless had realli struck her heart __PUNCT__

so i ask them to come up and her mother talk about be a hairdress __PUNCT__
she said __PUNCT__ my busi is not as good as it wa __PUNCT__
peopl aren't come in as often __PUNCT__
thei ar not will to pai what i need to make a live __PUNCT__
i about to be foreclos on __PUNCT__
i have on of those adjust rate mortgag __PUNCT__
i gone from pai __MONEY__ a month to __MONEY__ a month __PUNCT__
i don't think we will be abl to stai in our home __PUNCT__
i remind everi singl dai why i do thi __PUNCT__
it not about speech for me __PUNCT__ it not about the bright light and the camera __PUNCT__ it is about the chang we can make that actual deliv result in peopl live that give them a chanc to live up and fulfil their own dream __PUNCT__
far from here in thi beauti ballroom __PUNCT__ across the world our men and women in uniform ar serv our countri brave and honor __PUNCT__ some on their second or third or even fourth tour of duti __PUNCT__
thei deserv a command in chief who will bring them home __PUNCT__
all american again want __PUNCT__ need and deserv a presid who will bring your voic and your valu back to the white hous __PUNCT__
i know we will all breath a sigh of relief when that move van pull up in the back of the white hous and georg bush and dick chenei turn over the kei __PUNCT__
but thi elect is not just about the failur of the past seven year or the divis of the present or the excit of the moment __PUNCT__
thi elect must be about the futur we want and how we can make it a realiti __PUNCT__
we all have dream __PUNCT__
we have dream for our famili __PUNCT__ for our futur __PUNCT__
our countri is found on the idea of the american dream __PUNCT__ that with optim and confid and without fear __PUNCT__ we can make the futur happen by work hard and take respons __PUNCT__
that what ha alwai made america great and differ __PUNCT__
thi gener __PUNCT__ like gener befor us __PUNCT__ is call to make it own commit and sacrific __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ can be a great gener to make the american dream real in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
but to do that we must get real about what it will take to have the futur we dream of __PUNCT__
i onc wrote a book call __PUNCT__ it take a villag __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i still believ that true __PUNCT__
i will be a presid for all of you but for me to be your presid and for us to reach america promis in thi centuri __PUNCT__ we also have to agre that share opportun and share prosper requir share respons as parent __PUNCT__ as neighbor __PUNCT__ as worker __PUNCT__ as busi and polit leader __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__
thi is about all of us come togeth to stake our claim on what it mean to be an american in thi centuri __PUNCT__
there ar peopl sai that america best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ that the competit we face from china and elsewher will mean that we can't continu to have a strong middl class with rise incom and the kind of qualiti of life and standard of live that we have taken for grant __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i reject that __PUNCT__
i know thi will not be easi __PUNCT__
those who claim that it can be done with rel littl effort don't understand what we up against __PUNCT__
we face real challeng __PUNCT__ real threat __PUNCT__ we have to be readi to summon the experi __PUNCT__ the wisdom and the determin to solv our problem __PUNCT__
it will take more than just speech to fulfil our dream __PUNCT__
it will take a lot of hard work __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ if we get america back into the solut busi __PUNCT__ if we get real about our futur __PUNCT__ i am confid that we be back here in five year and we will sai __PUNCT__ weren't we on top of it __PUNCT__ didn't we understand what we had to do to make a differ __PUNCT__
becaus togeth there isn't anyth that can stop us __PUNCT__
so let get real about the economi __PUNCT__
we see an america where our economi work not just for the few __PUNCT__ the wealthi and the well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ but work for all of us __PUNCT__
how will we do that __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we go to start by creat good job again and by keep the job we have here and prevent them from be export like thei were some dispos commod __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__ we have to chang our trade polici __PUNCT__ we have to chang our tax polici __PUNCT__ we have to chang our vision and understand about what it will take to creat the job of the futur __PUNCT__
but that what i been do for year __PUNCT__
upstat new york ha a lot in common with wisconsin __PUNCT__
we lost our manufactur base but i didn't sai __PUNCT__ well that the end __PUNCT__ we can't do it __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ you see __PUNCT__ i don't believ we can have a strong economi and a strong countri without a strong manufactur base __PUNCT__
so i go to work to make sure we get it back __PUNCT__
let get real about our energi polici __PUNCT__
let see an america that stand up to the oil compani and the oil produc countri and sai __PUNCT__ you don't need our tax dollar ani longer to make outrag profit __PUNCT__
let begin to take the tax subsidi awai from the oil compani __PUNCT__
let impos a windfal profit tax on these outrag profit and put it to work on clean renew energi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know we can't do ani of thi until the two oil men leav the white hous but as soon as thei do __PUNCT__ we go to be readi for a new energi futur with the million and million of job that we can creat __PUNCT__
i think we can creat five million job in the next ten year if we do thi right __PUNCT__
and there no reason we can't __PUNCT__
earlier todai i said to the folk at the brat shop __PUNCT__ i said look germani creat job with solar power __PUNCT__ hundr of thousand of them __PUNCT__
we have a lot of peopl in wisconsin of german descent __PUNCT__ there ar as mani sunni dai in wisconsin as there ar in germani __PUNCT__ let get busi and creat these job right here in milwauke and in oshkosh and in green bai and in eau clair and madison __PUNCT__
let get real about health care __PUNCT__
now we have a choic we have __NUM__ million peopl uninsur and we can continu to think that a terribl problem and do noth about it or we can roll up our sleev and come up with a uniqu american solut __PUNCT__
that is what i have propos __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i think it is moral wrong that you have __NUM__ peopl in wisconsin who don't have health insur __PUNCT__
i think it is a nation disgrac __PUNCT__
ar we sai to ourselv we just can't figur thi out __PUNCT__ we can't take on the health insur compani __PUNCT__ we can't take on the republican to achiev univers health care __PUNCT__ i don't accept that for a minut __PUNCT__
univers health care ha been a fundament democrat parti __PUNCT__ it been part of the progress tradit here in wisconsin for as long as anyon can rememb __PUNCT__
we cannot in anywai cede univers health care __PUNCT__ it should be a defin issu in thi gener elect __PUNCT__
i believ we can win on univers health care __PUNCT__
let get real about educ __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we can't continu to have unfund mandat come from washington __PUNCT__ so let figur out what we go to do __PUNCT__
i will do everyth possibl to fulli fund special educ someth that ha been promis but never fulfil for more then __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and i will end the unfund mandat know as no child left behind __PUNCT__ it is not work for our kid and our teacher __PUNCT__
and i believ we can make colleg afford again if we take on the student loan industri and get them out of the wai __PUNCT__ get back to direct lend from the feder govern __PUNCT__ the wai it us to work let get real about restor america role in the world __PUNCT__
you know as well as i do that our relationship have been destroi __PUNCT__
we have to rebuild our allianc __PUNCT__
we have to be will to find common ground with the rest of the world again __PUNCT__
and thi is not about get everybodi to like us __PUNCT__ that not what it about __PUNCT__
thi is about have alli to deal with the big problem we face __PUNCT__ global terror global warm global epidem __PUNCT__
we can't tackl those on our own __PUNCT__
and you know you can't be a leader if no on is follow __PUNCT__
we got to get into the leadership busi again in the world __PUNCT__
we also have to do everyth we can to make it clear that restor our leadership and our moral author in the world start with end the war in iraq and bring our troop home respons and quickli __PUNCT__
i have said that i will start bring them home within the first __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
from my posit on the senat arm servic committe i been work to make sure that we ar prepar to do that __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thi administr ha not plan for withdraw our troop becaus thei don't want to do it __PUNCT__
thei ar go to leav it complet to us __PUNCT__
so we have to be prepar to think thi through __PUNCT__ to make sure that we protect our young men and women as thei depart __PUNCT__
and then we have to ask ourselv __PUNCT__ what do we do with the __NUM__ plu civilian who ar there __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i think about thi becaus i imagin what the respons will be like sit alon in the oval offic __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the advisor have given you their advic but ultim it up to you to decid __PUNCT__
and what do we do about the iraqi who help us __PUNCT__ the translat who made the differ between life and death for our soldier and our marin __PUNCT__
we ar an honor countri and we have to withdraw in a wai that keep faith with the sacrific of those who have been lost __PUNCT__ with those who have been injur __PUNCT__
and we must make it clear there is no militari solut __PUNCT__ bring our peopl home and tell the iraqi thei have to take respons for their own futur __PUNCT__
and as we bring them home __PUNCT__ we have to take care of them __PUNCT__
you know in kenosha again __PUNCT__ a young man reach out hi hand __PUNCT__ he had a t __PUNCT__ shirt on which said us marin corp __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ take care of my buddi __PUNCT__ a lot of them ar still over there __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ and then will you pleas help take care of me __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ i can't get an appoint for month to get my problem taken care of at the v.a __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i think when young men and women sign up to serv america __PUNCT__ we sign up to serv them __PUNCT__
thei deserv the health care __PUNCT__ the compens __PUNCT__ the servic thei have earn __PUNCT__
obvious to do all of thi we have to take on the power structur in washington __PUNCT__
i alwai a littl amus when someon sai __PUNCT__ we go to go after the special interest __PUNCT__
there isn't anyth more import then rein them in __PUNCT__
but we got to do it in a wai that bring the american peopl along with us __PUNCT__
it not enough just to impos rule on them __PUNCT__ which senat feingold ha been such a leader on __PUNCT__ we got to figur out how we prevent them from take advantag of the american peopl with higher prescript drug cost __PUNCT__ with higher energi cost __PUNCT__ with lost job that go oversea __PUNCT__
thi is a job for all of us __PUNCT__ not just for our next presid __PUNCT__
we have to have a coalit that take on all of these interest __PUNCT__
i have an aggress agenda that will save the american peopl at least __NUM__ billion dollar a year __PUNCT__
if we impos that windfal profit tax __PUNCT__ if we get aggress in go after the oil compani who alwai seem to be rais the price no matter what els is go on __PUNCT__
if we rein in health insur __PUNCT__ rein in drug cost __PUNCT__ we can begin to end these subsidi that have unfortun shift so much wealth awai from the middl class __PUNCT__
that the kind of america that we have to build again __PUNCT__
it not go to be easi but it doabl __PUNCT__
it go to take strength and experi __PUNCT__ someth that goe along with the job __PUNCT__
chang is go to happen __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ ar we go to get the right kind of chang __PUNCT__
becaus what i interest in is not just chang for the sake of chang __PUNCT__ but progress __PUNCT__
the kind of progress that will make a differ in the live of the peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__
and we know pretti well what the republican will do becaus thei like nomine will be senat mccain __PUNCT__
he a man whom i consid a friend and whom i deepli respect for hi lifetim of servic to our countri __PUNCT__
he a good man with the wrong idea __PUNCT__
and i believ we need a nomine who can go toe __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ toe with john mccain to make the differ absolut clear to the american peopl __PUNCT__
he want to keep troop in iraq for __NUM__ to __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i start bring them home within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
he admit he doesn't understand the economi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i have a strategi to end the hous crisi __PUNCT__
when that young girl and her mother came up __PUNCT__ i told them i been push on a moratorium on home foreclosur __PUNCT__
end the home foreclosur for __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
let peopl work out a chanc to stai in their home __PUNCT__ have the lender understand that somebodi pai __MONEY__ is better than an empti hous becaus thei couldn't pai __MONEY__
senat mccain won't deliv univers health care __PUNCT__
i the onli candid left in either parti with a plan to cover everi singl american __PUNCT__
and these ar big differ __PUNCT__
so wisconsin democrat have a choic on tuesdai __PUNCT__
it not an easi choic __PUNCT__
i recogn that __PUNCT__
it kind of a good problem to have in a wai becaus either senat obama or i will make histori and we make histori becaus of all that we ar abl to exemplifi __PUNCT__ everyth that wa done to bring both of us to thi point __PUNCT__
but the question is not who will make histori __PUNCT__ but who will chang america __PUNCT__
who will bring about the posit differ __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ centuri solut that we so desper need __PUNCT__ i think that the choic is realli whether we go to have a fighter __PUNCT__ a doer and a champion again in the white hous __PUNCT__ somebodi who get up everi singl dai with determin __PUNCT__ backbon and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ tough __PUNCT__
i know some peopl have said that i am tough __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ we need a tough presid becaus we have tough problem wait for us __PUNCT__
when i sai i stand with you __PUNCT__ i will stand with you __PUNCT__
when i sai i will fight for you __PUNCT__ i will fight for you __PUNCT__
that what i done my whole life __PUNCT__
when i start my career fight for abus and neglect children and children with disabl __PUNCT__ i wa stand with the children who had drawn the short straw in life __PUNCT__
well i still stand with them todai __PUNCT__
when i went to beij as first ladi __PUNCT__ i stood up for the core american valu that women right ar human right and human right ar women right __PUNCT__
i took that messag to more than __NUM__ countri __PUNCT__ to women who couldn't vote or own properti or earn a salari or send their daughter to school __PUNCT__
and i still stand for women right and human right __PUNCT__
when i took on the special interest to try to bring health care to everi american back in __NUM__ the insur compani and the lobbyist came at me with everyth thei had __PUNCT__
but i still here and i still stand up to the special interest and i am still stand and fight for health care for everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child __PUNCT__
when the republican come after our nomine __PUNCT__ and you know thei will __PUNCT__ now i person believ thei should be so embarrass by the fail record of presid bush that thei should sai thei won't field a candid __PUNCT__ but i afraid thei will __PUNCT__ and so onc again we know exactli what thei will do __PUNCT__
thei throw everyth thei got at whichev on of us is nomin __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i been through it __PUNCT__ i beaten it __PUNCT__ i still stand and i will beat them again if i am your nomine __PUNCT__
if you stand with me on tuesdai __PUNCT__ then come __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ i will be stand on the step of the capitol and i will be express for all of us our passion commit to thi countri and what it stand for __PUNCT__
our belief that we mai have been on a detour from our destini but we ar back on the right track and that with all of us togeth we can turn thi countri around __PUNCT__
we ar a nation of idealist __PUNCT__ hold fast to our deepest valu __PUNCT__ that we ar all creat equal __PUNCT__ that thi gener of american is destin for great __PUNCT__ that everi child deserv to fulfil hi or her god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
it the ideal that is inscrib on the base of the statu of liberti __PUNCT__ the word that give voic to america embrac __PUNCT__ give me your tire __PUNCT__ your poor __PUNCT__ your huddl mass yearn to breath free __PUNCT__
ladi liberti ha overlook the new york harbor through war and depress and the dark __PUNCT__ dark dai of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ a constant remind that here in america we face our challeng and we embrac all of our peopl __PUNCT__
so tonight __PUNCT__ let us sai with on voic __PUNCT__ give us the child who want to learn __PUNCT__ give us the peopl in need of work __PUNCT__ give us the veteran who need our care __PUNCT__ give us thi economi to rebuild and thi war to end __PUNCT__ give us thi nation to heal __PUNCT__ thi world to lead __PUNCT__ thi moment to seiz __PUNCT__
