but now __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ the presid mai acknowledg what the american peopl have known for year __PUNCT__ that the economi is not work for middl class and work famili __PUNCT__
and i welcom the presid to thi convers __PUNCT__
becaus it a convers that american have been have and that i been have with so mani peopl everi dai for year __PUNCT__
i listen to the voic of so mani american as i travel the countri __PUNCT__
the voic of peopl who work hard all dai __PUNCT__ then sometim addition on the night shift __PUNCT__ but it still not enough __PUNCT__
peopl who whisper to me about the mortgag thei can't afford and the home thei lose __PUNCT__ about medic bill that wipe them and their save out __PUNCT__
about tuition cost that have cut short the hope thei had about send a child to colleg __PUNCT__
mani peopl ar simpli overwhelm by the econom condit thei confront everi dai __PUNCT__
i heard from plenti of peopl who also tell me __PUNCT__ i ok right now __PUNCT__ but what about next year __PUNCT__ or even next month __PUNCT__ the wai thing ar go with peopl lose job and home __PUNCT__ what if my famili is next __PUNCT__ thi is a time of uncertainti and grow anxieti __PUNCT__
we didn't wind up here by accid __PUNCT__
as presid kennedi onc observ __PUNCT__ econom polici can result from govern inact as well as government action __PUNCT__
we here in part becaus the presid fail to listen to the voic of peopl who ar hurt __PUNCT__ fail to get involv in the actual work of run the govern __PUNCT__ and fail to act __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he ha stai at a comfort cruis altitud __PUNCT__ well abov the realiti of peopl live __PUNCT__ deleg respons to hi advis __PUNCT__ hope the buck would stop somewher els __PUNCT__ anywher els __PUNCT__
in just seven year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha taken us from record surplus into a larg and grow deficit __PUNCT__ from a project __MONEY__ trillion surplu to a __MONEY__ trillion debt __PUNCT__
we have seen our grow __PUNCT__ thrive economi that creat __NUM__ million job in the 1990 push to the brink of recess __PUNCT__
and we see the rippl effect around the world __PUNCT__
thi week __PUNCT__ mani countri saw their largest on __PUNCT__ dai stock market declin sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__
in thi new centuri __PUNCT__ the stake have never been higher __PUNCT__
the challeng have never been bigger or more urgent __PUNCT__
but the opportun ar also there __PUNCT__ if we get about the busi of seiz them __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ our econom problem ar admittedli complex __PUNCT__
but there is on thing we know for sure __PUNCT__ the problem with our economi is not the american peopl __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ the problem is __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ the bankrupt idea that have govern us for the last seven year __PUNCT__
thei have reward the veri few at the expens of the mani __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar actual the solut to our econom problem __PUNCT__
american ar the hardest work peopl in the world __PUNCT__ our product goe up everi year __PUNCT__
that mean we work harder and harder and produc more __PUNCT__
peopl ar innov __PUNCT__ thei ar entrepreneur __PUNCT__ thei take risk __PUNCT__ thei start small busi __PUNCT__
thei ar constantli think about the futur __PUNCT__
the factori worker and the ceo __PUNCT__ the farmer or the small busi owner __PUNCT__ the scientist in the lab __PUNCT__ or the teacher in the classroom __PUNCT__ everybodi who get up everi dai and get their job done __PUNCT__ support their famili __PUNCT__ that is the strength of the american economi __PUNCT__
and it time we final had a presid who work as hard for you as you work for america everi singl dai __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ in the end __PUNCT__ it is all about peopl __PUNCT__
it is all about the woman in columbia who grab my hand and said that her child wa sick and the insur compani wouldn't pai for the treatment that wa necessari __PUNCT__
it all about the man in florenc some month ago who came up to me some month ago and said __PUNCT__ i just keep work harder and harder and i feel like i fall further and further backward __PUNCT__
but i have a small busi __PUNCT__ i depend on transport my good __PUNCT__ and the cost of energi just keep go up __PUNCT__
it about the real live of real peopl right here in south carolina __PUNCT__
the presid matter more now than ever __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will run the govern and manag the economi __PUNCT__
american peopl don't hire a presid to talk about our problem but to solv them __PUNCT__ to set a vision for the futur __PUNCT__ and then to roll up our sleev and get about fulfil it __PUNCT__
it time for a presid who believ that lead an econom comeback is a fulltim __PUNCT__ hand __PUNCT__ on job __PUNCT__
who renew our commit to a strong and prosper middl class and bring busi __PUNCT__ labor and govern togeth to restor america competit in a fast chang world __PUNCT__
a presid who ha a vision for a twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri economi base on share prosper __PUNCT__
where we measur our success not by the wealth at the veri top but by how broadli wealth is share __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ with all due respect to a lot of my friend on the other side of the aisl __PUNCT__ i do not believ it is rich peopl who made america great __PUNCT__
i believ it is the hard work peopl of america who made our countri great __PUNCT__
we want to get back to reward hard work __PUNCT__
we want the american dream to be within everyon reach __PUNCT__
we want to make invest in on anoth that allow us __PUNCT__ particularli our children __PUNCT__ to live up to our god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
these ar not just econom issu __PUNCT__ these ar moral issu about our common purpos as a nation __PUNCT__
whether peopl can provid for their famili __PUNCT__ whether thei can share in the bless of thi great countri __PUNCT__ that speak to who we ar as a peopl and what we valu __PUNCT__
the wai we bring our countri togeth is by act on our valu __PUNCT__
true uniti can onli be achiev by find real solut for the american peopl __PUNCT__ and then deliv them __PUNCT__
without real solut __PUNCT__ divis and disappoint __PUNCT__ not uniti __PUNCT__ will be the result __PUNCT__
we been there befor __PUNCT__
presid bush promis to be a unit __PUNCT__ not a divid __PUNCT__
and we know how well that turn out __PUNCT__
becaus uniti come from take on the tough challeng __PUNCT__ ask us to be bigger than ourselv __PUNCT__ summon up to great __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__
and that is what i intend to do as presid __PUNCT__ on dai on __PUNCT__
i will bring the voic of the american peopl back to the white hous __PUNCT__
i will ask all of us to be involv in solv our problem __PUNCT__
otherwis __PUNCT__ here is what i fear __PUNCT__
most of us __PUNCT__ as i look around thi room __PUNCT__ with the except of the student who ar crowd into the foyer and spill out the door __PUNCT__ we have been the beneficiari of the sacrific that came from previou gener __PUNCT__ from parent and grandpar __PUNCT__ from peopl who fought the war __PUNCT__ and built big busi __PUNCT__ and did the labor __PUNCT__ who creat the extraordinari success of that america is __PUNCT__
we have to keep faith with all that came befor us __PUNCT__
i don't think ani of us want to be part of the first gener of american to leav our countri wors off than when we found it __PUNCT__
that would be such a breach with what american histori ha meant to all of us __PUNCT__
so the time for wait is over and the time for talk is over __PUNCT__
too mani famili ar pai the price of inact __PUNCT__ right here and right now __PUNCT__ so i think we need to begin act __PUNCT__ and we can't wait until __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we need both an immedi __PUNCT__ short __PUNCT__ term plan to jumpstart the economi __PUNCT__ and a long __PUNCT__ term econom vision with strategi to keep the economi go well into the futur __PUNCT__
so let start with the short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
if i were presid right now __PUNCT__ i would work with the congress to jumpstart the economi by immedi address the hous crisi __PUNCT__ creat new job __PUNCT__ and get monei back into the pocket of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we know that the loss of a home is devast and so mani famili across our countri ar face that __PUNCT__
but it not onli those who ar actual lose their home i worri about __PUNCT__
becaus of thi mortgag crisi __PUNCT__ everi home owner is lose valu in our home __PUNCT__
the american peopl have lost more than __MONEY__ trillion worth of valu in our home in the last year __PUNCT__ that nearli half the size of the entir unit state govern budget __PUNCT__
and african american famili ar especi hard hit __PUNCT__ subprim loan ar five time more common in predominantli african american neighborhood than predominantli white on __PUNCT__
but thi is not just an econom crisi __PUNCT__ it is truli an american dream crisi __PUNCT__
your home isn't just your onli greatest sourc of wealth __PUNCT__ it your greatest sourc of secur __PUNCT__
it what anchor us to our neighborhood and commun __PUNCT__
it where we rais our kid __PUNCT__ celebr birthdai and holidai __PUNCT__ and make memori togeth __PUNCT__
i have visit with so mani peopl in their home and i know what our home mean to us __PUNCT__
i know the feel of refug and secur i feel when i walk into my own home __PUNCT__
i know what it like to sit in home where famili haven't had the monei to bui all the furnitur thei need but thei so proud to show off their new home __PUNCT__
and nearli a year ago __PUNCT__ i call for immedi action to address thi mount mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
less than two week after that __PUNCT__ the bush administr told congress that what i wa call for wasn't necessari __PUNCT__ that the problem wa contain __PUNCT__
sever month later __PUNCT__ the presid assur us that there would be a soft land for the hous market __PUNCT__
but now we know better __PUNCT__
so all of last year __PUNCT__ i propos polici to help famili keep their home __PUNCT__
i wrote to the regul urg them to take their head out of the sand and do someth for the million of famili at risk of foreclosur __PUNCT__
i introduc legisl to crack down on abus lend practic and give state the resourc to help at __PUNCT__ risk famili avoid lose their home __PUNCT__
the result __PUNCT__ a plan from presid bush that let bank off the hook and leav homeown to fend for themselv __PUNCT__
in the word of on expert __PUNCT__ the presid plan wa __PUNCT__ the bank lobbi dream __PUNCT__
thi administr ha deliv a foreclosur notic on the american dream __PUNCT__
the presid plan to fix our economi would do next to noth about the foreclosur crisi __PUNCT__
and thei said that my insist on stop foreclosur just doesn't make sens __PUNCT__
well i sorri to disagre __PUNCT__
the hous crisi is contribut to rise unemploy __PUNCT__
construct job ar disappear __PUNCT__ and i see a few hard __PUNCT__ hat here in the audienc __PUNCT__
south carolina alon lost __NUM__ construct job in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it eras famili __PUNCT__ wealth __PUNCT__ jeopard consum spend __PUNCT__ which constitut two __PUNCT__ third of our economi __PUNCT__
it caus __MONEY__ billion in loss to bank __PUNCT__ make them less like to offer credit to busi and famili that need it __PUNCT__
that why my plan to fix the economi start by do everyth possibl to ensur that we don't lose ani more home and that we stabil the economi when it come to the mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
i want to start with a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ dai moratorium on foreclosur __PUNCT__
if the bank is about to foreclos on your home __PUNCT__ you should have some breath room to restructur your mortgag __PUNCT__
i call for freez the monthli rate on adjust rate mortgag for at least five year or until the mortgag have been convert into loan that famili can afford __PUNCT__
if you have an adjust mortgag that about to skyrocket __PUNCT__ you have the chanc to pai it off with afford payment __PUNCT__
peopl sai well isn't thi reward peopl who mayb got in over their head __PUNCT__ well to some extent it is try to stop what is happen that will affect all of us __PUNCT__
if we don't help these famili work out their mortgag now we will have more empti home becaus the hous market is so low right now __PUNCT__ nobodi is bui __PUNCT__
then we have deterior neighborhood __PUNCT__ then we have decreas tax revenu for citi and town __PUNCT__ it becom a viciou cycl __PUNCT__
that why i also would also creat a __MONEY__ billion fund to help hard __PUNCT__ hit commun and distress homeown weather the foreclosur crisi __PUNCT__
we need to be sure to shore up our commun so that thei don't begin to also deterior in the face of a loss in the home market __PUNCT__
i also would includ direct tax rebat to work and middl class famili __PUNCT__
we need to target it to those who ar most in need __PUNCT__
the democrat leadership in the hous and senat along with the white hous appear to be near a deal and i am hearten to hear that thei ar plan to extend assist to the ten of million of work american who need it the most __PUNCT__
that what i have been call for and that what i think we have to do __PUNCT__
but i also want to target the need of work famili that ar realli face tough choic __PUNCT__
we need relief from skyrocket energi bill __PUNCT__
we need expand unemploy insur for those who ar struggl to find a job __PUNCT__
but i want to think about the futur __PUNCT__ that why i would take immedi step to spur __PUNCT__ green collar __PUNCT__ job growth __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__ renew energi job that ar good for our environ and cannot be outsourc __PUNCT__
i would do thi immedi through a crash weather program that would put peopl to work __PUNCT__ help to insul home __PUNCT__ and give green collar job train initi to help prepar peopl __PUNCT__
i would also implement my green build fund to rebuild and renov school and other public build to help make them more energi effici __PUNCT__
we can creat million of new job in america through clean __PUNCT__ renew energi __PUNCT__
i know we can do it becaus i seen what other countri have done __PUNCT__
germani decid a few year ago to make a big bet on solar power __PUNCT__
thei creat tax incent __PUNCT__ thei creat train program to take construct worker and other to know how to instal solar panel __PUNCT__
thei have creat sever hundr thousand new job in three short year __PUNCT__
thei have a smaller economi than our __PUNCT__
if we got seriou about thi __PUNCT__ i know we could do the same __PUNCT__
i realli hope that as part of thi recoveri packag __PUNCT__ we start get seriou about the futur __PUNCT__
we have to stop the crisi but then we have to plan for an economi that will keep gener good new job __PUNCT__ and clean energi is our best bet __PUNCT__
but jumpstart the economi in the short __PUNCT__ term is just the begin __PUNCT__
we need a long __PUNCT__ term vision to build a strong __PUNCT__ prosper economi for the next gener __PUNCT__
i think it wa winston churchil who said that __PUNCT__ the differ between a politician and a statesman is that the politician think about the next elect __PUNCT__ while the statesman think about the next gener __PUNCT__
we got to start think about the next gener __PUNCT__
we can't do thi piecem __PUNCT__ we got to start help peopl more __PUNCT__
mayb you want to start save for retir __PUNCT__ but you can't do it becaus your tax ar too high and your wage aren't high enough __PUNCT__
mayb you want to go back to school __PUNCT__ but your health care premium ar too high so you can't afford tuition __PUNCT__
we live in a complex __PUNCT__ interconnect __PUNCT__ global economi __PUNCT__
all of our challeng ar all togeth now __PUNCT__
we can't just put band __PUNCT__ aid on on and expect to solv our problem __PUNCT__
what we have to do is have a plan to creat good job and restor fair to the economi __PUNCT__
we need to renew the promis of america that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
we need to return to fiscal respons __PUNCT__ so that washington onc again live within a budget __PUNCT__ just like you and your famili ha to do __PUNCT__
i believ solv the job crisi over the long run start with solv the energi crisi __PUNCT__
that why i will creat a __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund to jumpstart invest in clean energi technolog __PUNCT__
we will creat a green revolut with invest in biofuel __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ geotherm __PUNCT__ all of the clean energi and energi effici chang we need to make __PUNCT__
and as we creat these new job possibl for the next gener we will pai for it by elimin the tax subsidi for the big oil compani and requir them to pai into the strateg energi fund __PUNCT__ or invest in altern energi themselv __PUNCT__
thei have made record profit in recent year __PUNCT__
now it time thei did their fair share __PUNCT__
i also know that we won't get ani of thi done until the two oil men leav the white hous but as soon as thei do __PUNCT__ we will start to work on thi long __PUNCT__ term vision __PUNCT__
we also help creat job by modern and rebuild our crumbl infrastructur __PUNCT__
the tragic bridg collaps in minnesota thi past summer __PUNCT__ a recent leve break in nevada __PUNCT__ and what happen with the leve in new orlean ar pain remind that our infrastructur is in danger disrepair __PUNCT__
everi billion dollar that we spend fix crumbl infrastructur creat __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
i have a rebuild america plan to invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year in an __PUNCT__ emerg repair fund __PUNCT__
we need to modern our port __PUNCT__ our rail system __PUNCT__ our airport __PUNCT__ our public transit system __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ our tunnel __PUNCT__ our road __PUNCT__
we need to expand access to broadband across america __PUNCT__ particularli to rural area __PUNCT__
we need to end thi administr war on scienc and restor america to it right place __PUNCT__
as the innov nation __PUNCT__ i will increas invest in basic and appli research at the nation scienc foundat __PUNCT__ the nation institut of health and our other govern agenc and univers __PUNCT__
we becam so success after world war ii becaus busi and scienc work hand in hand with govern __PUNCT__
our great univers like furman were on the cut edg of discoveri that we translat into better outcom for peopl __PUNCT__
but creat job is just the begin __PUNCT__
we need to empow our worker and ensur that our tax system is fair __PUNCT__
that the second piec of a long __PUNCT__ term plan __PUNCT__
for the past seven year __PUNCT__ the oil compani __PUNCT__ the predatori student loan compani __PUNCT__ the insur compani __PUNCT__ the drug compani have had a presid who stand up for them __PUNCT__
i intend to be a presid who stand up for you everi singl dai about how we make america work better for you __PUNCT__
dure the 1950 and 60 which mani of us look back at with great appreci becaus the economi work so well __PUNCT__ for so long __PUNCT__ for so mani __PUNCT__ we had a much higher percentag of our workforc union __PUNCT__
now it is much lower __PUNCT__
we need to make sure peopl can organ and bargain for good wage and safe work condit __PUNCT__
we need to be sure that we restor fair to the economi by restor fair to the tax code __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ some of the peopl i repres in new york citi __PUNCT__ wall street invest manag __PUNCT__ make __MONEY__ million a year pai just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ on their earn __PUNCT__ while a teacher make __MONEY__ pai __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i don't think that right and i been call to rais the tax on those peopl at the top __PUNCT__
as corpor profit have skyrocket __PUNCT__ the percentag of tax paid by corpor ha fallen __PUNCT__
we have richli reward peopl and i am all in favor of incentiv peopl to do well __PUNCT__
that is part of what america stand for __PUNCT__
but it isn't right that the wealthi and the well __PUNCT__ connect have gotten so mani more benefit than the middl class and work peopl have __PUNCT__
we need to extend middl class tax cut __PUNCT__ includ the child tax credit __PUNCT__ marriag penalti relief __PUNCT__
we need to reform the altern minimum tax to ensur it doesn't hit middl class famili with higher tax rate __PUNCT__
it wa never suppos to do that __PUNCT__
we need to expand the earn incom tax credit and rais the minimum wage to ensur that work pai for all american __PUNCT__
no on who work full time should live in poverti __PUNCT__
if you work full time you shouldn't be in poverti __PUNCT__
we need to give peopl the tool and support thei need to succe in todai complex economi __PUNCT__
that start with recommit ourselv to make colleg afford for our young peopl __PUNCT__
that especi import here in south carolina __PUNCT__ the averag student debt upon graduat is __MONEY__
so you start in a big hole befor you ever go to work on the first dai __PUNCT__
and you know what happen which is realli troubl to me __PUNCT__ america higher educ system which wa the envi of the world __PUNCT__ we had an open system __PUNCT__ the highest percentag of young peopl who went to get degre __PUNCT__ but now from japan to south korea to canada and ireland __PUNCT__ other countri ar educ their young peopl at a higher rate than here in america __PUNCT__
the reason for that is the cost ha explod __PUNCT__
it is more expens todai than it wa thirti year ago to send a child to colleg __PUNCT__
that why i outlin a comprehens plan to open the door of colleg to young peopl __PUNCT__
it includ a new __MONEY__ colleg tax credit that will cover more than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the typic cost of public colleg and univers or the full cost of tuition and fee for commun colleg __PUNCT__
i also want to increas the size of pell grant __PUNCT__ someth that former secretari rilei mention __PUNCT__
i want to strengthen commun colleg __PUNCT__ invest __MONEY__ million to support innov __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ job train and apprenticeship program for those who don't go to colleg __PUNCT__
we also have to ensur that everi american ha qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care __PUNCT__
here in south carolina alon __PUNCT__ __NUM__ peopl ar uninsur __PUNCT__
i want to ask you __PUNCT__ how mani of you know someon here in south carolina who is uninsur __PUNCT__ how mani of you know somebodi who mai have insur but it just doesn't pai for what the doctor or the hospit sai you need __PUNCT__ we have two problem __PUNCT__ we have the problem of the uninsur and the problem of the underinsur __PUNCT__
my american health choic plan would insur everi singl person for what thei need __PUNCT__
it simpl __PUNCT__ if you have insur you like __PUNCT__ you keep it __PUNCT__
there is no disrupt __PUNCT__
if you have a good polici through your busi or through a union or through a municip __PUNCT__ noth chang __PUNCT__
but if you don't have insur __PUNCT__ or you don't like the insur you have __PUNCT__ you can choos from the same menu of privat plan avail to member of congress __PUNCT__
and we will provid tax credit to help you afford it __PUNCT__
my plan also ban insur compani discrimin __PUNCT__ so you will never be deni coverag becaus of pre __PUNCT__ exist condit or risk factor that you might have __PUNCT__
and we don't requir small busi to do anyth but it doe provid tax credit to help small busi if thei choos to afford to bui health care for their employe __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we have to help more american save for a secur retir __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ fewer than half of all american have ani retir save account at all __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ i want to provid everi singl american with an easi __PUNCT__ automat opportun to save for the futur through __PUNCT__ american retir account __PUNCT__
these account will take the best of the __NUM__ plan and make them avail to everi work famili __PUNCT__
and we give famili up to __MONEY__ in tax cut to help them save __PUNCT__
and final we got to return to fiscal respons __PUNCT__
year after year __PUNCT__ the presid ha increas spend at more than doubl the rate of the previou administr and hand tax cut after tax cut to multi __PUNCT__ millionair __PUNCT__ oil compani and other interest group __PUNCT__
and how ha he paid for all of thi spend __PUNCT__ by borrow monei from foreign countri like china __PUNCT__
when peopl ask me __PUNCT__ why is it hard to get tough on china and enforc our trade agreement __PUNCT__ i tell them __PUNCT__ becaus thei our banker __PUNCT__
we ow them __PUNCT__
how can we truli enforc the trade law against a countri like china __PUNCT__ when our economi depend on china massiv loan to us __PUNCT__ think about it thi wai __PUNCT__ we borrow monei from china to bui oil from the saudi __PUNCT__
that is a dead __PUNCT__ end strategi for america __PUNCT__
and i go to end that strategi if i have the good fortun of becom your presid __PUNCT__
becaus i want america to regain control of it destini by move back toward a balanc budget and a surplu __PUNCT__
that why i work throughout thi campaign to show exactli how i would pai for everi initi that i have just mention __PUNCT__
not just how i run my campaign __PUNCT__ but run our countri as well __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ some peopl around the world and even some here at home ar basic sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we can't go back to the kind of economi we had befor __PUNCT__
thei act as though the 1990 wa ancient rome __PUNCT__
it work well in the 1990 __PUNCT__
the averag american famili had a __MONEY__ gain in incom in the 1990 __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ everi elect is about the futur but i do think there ar lesson we need to learn from the past __PUNCT__
becaus right now __PUNCT__ we ar on the wrong track __PUNCT__
