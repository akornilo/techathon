the carnegi institut for scienc __PUNCT__ as presid meserv just briefli recount __PUNCT__ ha such a distinguish histori __PUNCT__
it ha a record of support groundbreak discoveri from edwin hubbl work in astronomi to more recent breakthrough in our understand of genet and the function of rna and as part of that work wa honor with a nobel prize just a few year ago __PUNCT__
i could not imagin a more appropri place to discuss our nation commit to scientif discoveri and innov __PUNCT__
nor could i imagin a more appropri dai __PUNCT__
it is not a coincid that we ar do thi todai __PUNCT__
fifti year ago todai __PUNCT__ in a remot __PUNCT__ spars inhabit region of the former soviet union the world first artifici satellit took flight __PUNCT__
thi hollow aluminum sphere name sputnik __PUNCT__ which contain littl more than a batteri __PUNCT__ radio transmitt __PUNCT__ and an intern cool system __PUNCT__ caught america off guard and chang the cours of histori __PUNCT__
sputnik transmit a signal from orbit and through it the soviet union sent a signal to the world __PUNCT__
even ham radio oper could hear it __PUNCT__ the soviet had won the first leg of the space race __PUNCT__
now mani of you have probabl known befor you came todai that thi is the anniversari of sputnik and i bet none of you bought an anniversari card __PUNCT__
but i have been fascin by sputnik ever sinc i wa a littl girl and as i have move on in life and becom involv in the public servic and public offic hold of our nation __PUNCT__ i have spent time reflect on what sputnik meant and what our nation did in respons __PUNCT__
histor decis were made in the dai __PUNCT__ month __PUNCT__ and year follow sputnik and i think we had a great respons as a nation __PUNCT__
less than two week after new of sputnik swept the globe __PUNCT__ presid eisenhow call a meet of hi scienc advisori committe and ask for recommend __PUNCT__
he would come to reli on that panel for unvarnish __PUNCT__ evid __PUNCT__ base scientif advic __PUNCT__
shortli after that first meet __PUNCT__ presid eisenhow address the nation __PUNCT__
it wa a sober yet optimist assess __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the soviet had made gain which carri implic for our secur and our economi __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we had work to do __PUNCT__
but there wa no reason to fear __PUNCT__ becaus america __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ stood at the readi to draw on our __PUNCT__ voluntari heroism __PUNCT__ sacrific __PUNCT__ and accomplish when the chip ar down __PUNCT__
then we set about prove it __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ of __NUM__ four month after sputnik launch __PUNCT__ america launch darpa __PUNCT__ the defens advanc research project agenc __PUNCT__
by __DATE__ of that year __PUNCT__ congress pass the nation aeronaut and space act __PUNCT__ creat nasa and usher in the mission that would defin the space race __PUNCT__ mercuri and gemini __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ presid eisenhow sign into law the nation defens educ act to advanc at everi level our abil to compet and innov __PUNCT__ math and scienc educ in primari and secondari school __PUNCT__ colleg loan __PUNCT__ graduat fellowship __PUNCT__ vocat train __PUNCT__
i rememb as though it were yesterdai when my __NUM__ grade teacher mr __PUNCT__ krau came into our classroom and told us we had to studi math and scienc becaus the presid said so __PUNCT__
i wa convinc presid eisenhow had call up mr __PUNCT__ krau and told her __PUNCT__ you tell those children and particularli that hillari __PUNCT__ who doesn't realli like math that much __PUNCT__ that her countri need her __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ presid kennedi creat the apollo project __PUNCT__ and declar that our nation would land a man on the moon and return him safe to the earth by the end of the decad __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ we had done it __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ we had done it __NUM__ time over __PUNCT__
it wa a nation __PUNCT__ bipartisan effort __PUNCT__
it wa a public __PUNCT__ privat partnership __PUNCT__
we bolster invest in research __PUNCT__ and encourag children to learn math and scienc __PUNCT__
we ask young peopl to becom scientist and engin __PUNCT__ and help them pai for their degre with new nation scienc foundat fellowship __PUNCT__
we believ that we could __PUNCT__ by roll up our sleev and get to work __PUNCT__ do what we all knew we had to __PUNCT__
begin to demonstr that america still wa the leader in scienc and innov __PUNCT__
we set big goal __PUNCT__
we didn't give in to our fear __PUNCT__ we confront them __PUNCT__
we didn't deni tough fact __PUNCT__ we respond to them __PUNCT__
we didn't ignor big challeng __PUNCT__ we met them __PUNCT__
onc again __PUNCT__ we prove __PUNCT__ as presid eisenhow had predict __PUNCT__ that when the chip ar down it is alwai a mistak to bet against america __PUNCT__
fifti year ago __PUNCT__ sputnik mark the dawn of the space ag and the begin of a new era fill with new challeng __PUNCT__
fifti year later __PUNCT__ there is no singl __PUNCT__ galvan event to steel our resolv and to lift our ey to the heaven __PUNCT__
the challeng we face ar more complex and interconnect __PUNCT__
from the rise of global to the threat of global warm __PUNCT__
these challeng requir big idea and bold think __PUNCT__
but instead of foster a climat of discoveri and innov __PUNCT__ the bush administr ha declar war on scienc __PUNCT__
the record is breathtak __PUNCT__ ban the most promis kind of stem cell research __PUNCT__ allow polit appointe to censor studi on climat chang __PUNCT__ muzzl global warm expert like dr __PUNCT__ jame hansen __PUNCT__ overrul doctor and the fda on emerg contracept __PUNCT__ suppress and manipul data on mercuri pollut __PUNCT__ even delai on report which found that __NUM__ percent of women between __NUM__ and __NUM__ year of ag have mercuri level in their blood that could harm futur children __PUNCT__ deni the risk of toxin like asbesto in the air after the 9/11 attack __PUNCT__ overrul scientist who sought to protect anim under the endang speci act __PUNCT__ elimin scientif committe at the depart of health and human servic that did not parrot the polit accept ideolog __PUNCT__ or pack those committe with industri insid __PUNCT__ alter scientif test on the lead content of children lunch box __PUNCT__ and appoint a lead industri consult to a kei panel form by the center for diseas control __PUNCT__ bar a usda research from publish or even discuss hi work on antibiot resist bacteria __PUNCT__ censor govern websit on breast cancer research __PUNCT__ contracept __PUNCT__ climat chang __PUNCT__ and so much els __PUNCT__
to paraphras stephen colbert __PUNCT__ thi administr doesn't make decis on fact __PUNCT__
it make fact base on decis __PUNCT__
and to further paraphras __PUNCT__ my predecessor __PUNCT__ the extraordinari late senat daniel patrick moynahan __PUNCT__ everyon is entitl to hi own opinion but no on is entitl to hi own fact __PUNCT__
for six and half year under presid bush __PUNCT__ it ha been open season on open inquiri __PUNCT__
thei tri to turn washington into an evid __PUNCT__ free zone __PUNCT__
and by ignor or manipul scienc __PUNCT__ the bush administr is put our futur at risk and let our econom competitor get an edg in the global economi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will end thi assault on scienc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i will reaffirm our commit to basic research __PUNCT__ invest in clean energi __PUNCT__ combat global warm __PUNCT__ creat the million of job that i think come from do both of those __PUNCT__ reemphas math and scienc educ __PUNCT__ and ensur that america is train the futur innov of our countri __PUNCT__
america will onc again be the innov nation __PUNCT__
what america achiev after sputnik is a symbol of what american can do now as we confront a new global economi __PUNCT__ new environment challeng __PUNCT__ and the promis of new discoveri in medicin __PUNCT__
america led in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and we saw the benefit of that __PUNCT__
as richard referenc __PUNCT__ probabl half of our gross domest product increas sinc the end of world war ii can be trace to invest in scienc and research in both the public and the privat sector __PUNCT__ of cours fuel by non profit organ like the carnegi institut __PUNCT__
with a renew commit to scientif integr and innov __PUNCT__ i know we can lead in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will lift the current ban on ethic stem cell research __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ presid bush issu an execut order ban feder fund for some of the most promis avenu of stem cell research __PUNCT__
and thi year __PUNCT__ yet again __PUNCT__ he veto legisl to open up new line of embryon stem cell for feder fund __PUNCT__
everi dai __PUNCT__ we ar learn more about the opportun thi kind of research offer __PUNCT__
within these cell mai lie the cure for parkinson diseas __PUNCT__ alzheim __PUNCT__ spinal cord injuri __PUNCT__ diabet __PUNCT__ huntington and more __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million american live with these condit __PUNCT__ and their famili live with them too __PUNCT__
the presid ban on stem cell fund amount to a ban on hope __PUNCT__
it as if these famili ar invis to their presid __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ our scientist and world class research institut ar hamstrung __PUNCT__
on report found that research have had to set up duplic system and equip to keep feder approv stem cell research effort separ from the kind that the presid ha ban by execut order __PUNCT__
in on lab __PUNCT__ research us on kind of pen for feder fund research __PUNCT__ and anoth for privat fund research __PUNCT__
on stem cell scientist at univers of california at san francisco wa conduct research when the power went out __PUNCT__ includ the power to the freezer that held the stem cell on which she ha spent two year work __PUNCT__
there wa no back up power and the onli freezer cold enough were feder fund __PUNCT__
the result __PUNCT__ two year of research liter melt awai __PUNCT__
state have tri to pick up the slack __PUNCT__ as have privat individu __PUNCT__
but becaus state and privat institut ar prohibit from do thi research in lab fund by feder dollar __PUNCT__ even a penni of feder monei disqualifi the lab __PUNCT__
thei been forc to build new lab and bui new equip __PUNCT__
so instead of forg ahead on the scienc __PUNCT__ we have spent monei on redund and duplic __PUNCT__
so far thei onli been abl to spend __NUM__ percent of their fund on actual research __PUNCT__
and some of our brightest mind ar forc to head oversea to do their research __PUNCT__
two renown cancer research __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ a husband and wife team __PUNCT__ decid to leav the nation cancer institut right here in our countri for the institut of molecular and cell biologi in singapor __PUNCT__
on half of the pair said thi __PUNCT__ we want to be in a place where thei ar excit by scienc and thing ar move upward __PUNCT__
that should be america __PUNCT__ and it can be again __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ countri from singapor to the unit kingdom ar fill the biotech gap that the presid ha creat __PUNCT__
on report recent found that the percentag of research paper on embryon stem cell scienc author by research in the unit state ha drop from more than a third of all publish to roughli on quarter in just three year __PUNCT__
and that neg trend mai continu __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ therefor __PUNCT__ on of my first act will be to lift the ban on feder fund of embryon stem cell research __PUNCT__
but we have to go much further than that if we expect to restor scientif integr __PUNCT__
secondli __PUNCT__ i will end the politic of scientif research that ha mark the bush administr and restor a climat of scientif integr and innov __PUNCT__
we will no longer place ideolog ahead of evid __PUNCT__
i revers presid bush recent direct which expand the power of polit appointe in agenc and reduc the role of expert __PUNCT__
i stop polit appointe from manipul scientif conclus in govern public and prevent the suppress of public statement by govern scientist __PUNCT__
we commit to a nation assess on climat chang that goe abov and beyond ani requir in the law __PUNCT__
and i demand that all agenc prevent polit pressur from affect scientif research and the free and open exchang of idea __PUNCT__
as part of thi effort __PUNCT__ i will restor the integr and independ of advisori committe and strengthen whistleblow protect for those who expos potenti polit interfer __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ scientif integr will not be the except __PUNCT__ it will be the rule __PUNCT__
that why i been fight for these issu in the senat __PUNCT__
on particular battl that i led involv emerg contracept __PUNCT__ known as plan b __PUNCT__ which can prevent unintend pregnanc __PUNCT__
two fda commission __PUNCT__ both appoint by presid bush __PUNCT__ block plan b from be sold over __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ counter for year __PUNCT__ overrul the fda medic expert __PUNCT__ advisor __PUNCT__ and the recommend of the american medic associ __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ team up with senat patti murrai __PUNCT__ we block two success bush appointe for a new fda commission until scienc not polit wa allow to guid decis make __PUNCT__
i made it veri clear i wa not in ani wai dictat __PUNCT__ suggest __PUNCT__ expect ani particular outcom __PUNCT__ but i did not want the fda politic to achiev an outcom that wa not base on the best that scienc and evid had to offer __PUNCT__
it should not take an act of congress or an act of a senat to get the presid to listen to health expert on a matter of women health __PUNCT__
i will also have an advisor for scienc in the white hous who report directli to the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and i will work to restor the offic of technolog assess in congress __PUNCT__
back in the 1990 __PUNCT__ thi offic wa charg with just on task __PUNCT__ tell us the truth about scienc __PUNCT__
for decad __PUNCT__ thei cut through the myth and the spin on everyth from star war to aid prevent to solar technolog __PUNCT__
it time we put them back in busi __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ we will again invest in research __PUNCT__
that a kei to creat the job of the futur __PUNCT__ rebuild the middl class __PUNCT__ and meet the challeng of the global economi __PUNCT__
here too __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ we fall behind __PUNCT__
over the past twelv year __PUNCT__ american invest in research and develop ha remain rel static __PUNCT__
china ha doubl the share of it nation wealth invest in r&d __PUNCT__
the educ pipelin __PUNCT__ the sourc of futur innov __PUNCT__ reveal the same trend __PUNCT__
between __NUM__ and __NUM__ america global share of phd in scienc and engin declin from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the rate is expect to drop to __NUM__ percent in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ under the bush administr __PUNCT__ spend on basic and appli research ha declin in real term four year in a row __PUNCT__
darpa __PUNCT__ where basic research led to the precursor of the internet __PUNCT__ the comput mous __PUNCT__ stealth technolog __PUNCT__ and so much more __PUNCT__ is put less and less of it resourc into truli revolutionari __PUNCT__ ground __PUNCT__ break research __PUNCT__
i becom troubl by thi becaus __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ we have veri specif issu we have to address __PUNCT__
the search for some technolog to disabl these horrif explos devic that caus so much damag for our young men and women in uniform and innoc iraqi and peopl in afghanistan is a veri import project but i think we can do both __PUNCT__
we can do the more appli __PUNCT__ specif research to try to solv a problem and we can continu to fund the more visionari research that we don't know where it will lead __PUNCT__ but who know __PUNCT__ the next internet mai come out of it __PUNCT__
the privat sector devot onli __NUM__ percent of all it resourc to basic research __PUNCT__
and that is a chang from __NUM__ year ago and the year after that __PUNCT__
some of the great research breakthrough came through privat lab like bell lab and other and we have not onli cut back on govern fund but becaus of the pressur of the global market place __PUNCT__ the pressur for quarterli return __PUNCT__ we have seen a cutback in research in the privat sector as well __PUNCT__
the nih budget wa doubl between __NUM__ and __NUM__ and univers and research had high hope for continu fund __PUNCT__
in the year sinc __PUNCT__ the rug ha been pull out from under them __PUNCT__
the presid budget for __NUM__ actual cut fund for sever depart __PUNCT__
the consequ of unpredict and declin resourc ar halt construct on new laboratori __PUNCT__ fewer grant __PUNCT__ uncertainti in current project __PUNCT__ and less support for the creativ idea of younger research __PUNCT__
nobel prize win biochemist roger kornberg recent said __PUNCT__ in the present climat especi __PUNCT__ the fund decis ar ultraconserv __PUNCT__
if the work that you propos to do isn't virtual certain of success __PUNCT__ then it won't be fund __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ the kind of work that we would most like to see take place __PUNCT__ which is groundbreak and innov __PUNCT__ li at the other extrem __PUNCT__
i visit memori sloan ketter about a year and half ago to meet with dr __PUNCT__ harold e __PUNCT__ varmu anoth nobel prize winner who led nih with such distinct and hi top staff __PUNCT__
and at that time he veri clearli said that the wai that the grant and now be issu by the nih mean that it less and less like that young research like he wa when he did the work that eventu won him the nobel prize __PUNCT__ could be fund __PUNCT__
and sinc that time i heard thi across the countri __PUNCT__
i will increas support for basic and appli research by increas the research budget at the nation scienc foundat __PUNCT__ the depart of energi offic of scienc __PUNCT__ and the depart of defens __PUNCT__
we significantli increas fund over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ with a greater emphasi on high __PUNCT__ risk __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ return invest __PUNCT__
that combin with the increas again in the nih to kick start our innov engin __PUNCT__
we invest more in multidisciplinari research __PUNCT__ where the unit state ha a built __PUNCT__ in advantag __PUNCT__
no on command the breadth and depth of excel across differ field that we do __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ we should increas invest in non __PUNCT__ health applic of bio __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__
on exampl __PUNCT__ bacteria that could dramat reduc the cost of clean up superfund site __PUNCT__
i recent saw craig venter __PUNCT__ who mani of you know of or know __PUNCT__ and hi latest project is try to creat bacteria that will lead to a substitut for petroleum __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we don't know where thi research will lead __PUNCT__
that the whole point and the excit is let loos our best mind __PUNCT__
the failur to modern our health care system is also hold back research __PUNCT__
i have propos creat a health inform technolog infrastructur as part of my health care plan __PUNCT__ the american health choic plan __PUNCT__
i think we can lower cost for everyon __PUNCT__ and improv qualiti for everyon __PUNCT__ and cover everyon __PUNCT__
a health inform technolog infrastructur is estim by the rand corpor to save us seventi __PUNCT__ seven billion dollar a year __PUNCT__
it will prevent error __PUNCT__ it will stop wast __PUNCT__ it will cut cost __PUNCT__ and it will save live becaus it will creat billion of new digit data point from which we can glean new observ __PUNCT__
i also call for competit prize to encourag innov __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ presid eisenhow __PUNCT__ when he met with hi scientif advisori committe again __PUNCT__ wonder if there were a wai to keep peopl as excit about scienc as thei were about sport and competit __PUNCT__
and thi wa back when realiti entertain meant plai in the neighborhood park __PUNCT__
why not encourag peopl to innov through healthi competit __PUNCT__ we also seen a declin in american leadership in space explor and scienc __PUNCT__
a recent survei by the nation academi of scienc found that __PUNCT__ the nation earth observ satellit program __PUNCT__ onc the envi of the world __PUNCT__ ar in disarrai __PUNCT__
the nation ocean and atmospher administr ha been forc to delai the launch of import climat and weather __PUNCT__ monitor satellit __PUNCT__
these technolog ar critic tool to studi climat chang __PUNCT__ measur the rate of melt ic __PUNCT__ temperatur and humid chang __PUNCT__ sea level variat __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ nasa budget for earth scienc ha been cut by __NUM__ percent and nasa climat scientist have been muzzl __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ the bush administr went so far as to remov the follow phrase __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ to understand and protect the home planet __PUNCT__ end quot __PUNCT__ from nasa mission statement __PUNCT__
it no wonder __PUNCT__ the bush administr ha shown littl interest in the earth scienc mission of nasa __PUNCT__ and a hostil approach toward the studi of climat chang __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ part of my mission will be to reclaim our role as the innov leader __PUNCT__
i will pursu an ambiti agenda in space explor and earth scienc __PUNCT__
i fulli fund nasa earth scienc program __PUNCT__ launch a new __PUNCT__ comprehens space __PUNCT__ base studi of climat chang __PUNCT__ and revers the deep fund cut that nasa and faa aeronaut research and develop budget have endur in the last few year __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thi is person for me becaus when i wa in junior high school __PUNCT__ i wa just captiv by the space program __PUNCT__
it caught my imagin __PUNCT__
there wa such a great burst of interest __PUNCT__
i did my __NUM__ grade scienc project on space medicin __PUNCT__
some of you know that i even wrote to nasa ask how i could appli to be an astronaut and got back an answer sai that thei weren't take women __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i have live long enough to see that chang __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ but that great burst of activ led to so mani peopl who ar the phd __PUNCT__ who ar the scientif leader __PUNCT__ who have made such a differ to our public life and our privat sector __PUNCT__
a lot of them ar reach retir ag __PUNCT__
thei came into school in the __NUM__ and the __NUM__ motiv by thi desir to innov and in our govern we not find the replac for a lot of peopl __PUNCT__
i know that at the nuclear regulatori commiss the workforc issu go forward is a veri big on __PUNCT__
so thi is not just about let have more scientist __PUNCT__
thi is how we run our economi and how our govern retain or should i sai regain compet to do what it need to do for all of us __PUNCT__
i think that we got to make scienc research __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ mathemat a career in those field __PUNCT__ excit again __PUNCT__
i think it possibl to do that and i think the presid __PUNCT__ even a presid who doesn't know veri much herself can ignit that interest with other peopl who ar plai the lead role in demonstr what it mean for us to be the leader again __PUNCT__
we realli need a televis seri about scientist __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the studi of forens scienc skyrocket after all these csi program __PUNCT__ so i like all of the scientist in thi auditorium to start think __PUNCT__
make up a charact that can light the same excit in young peopl becaus lightbulb moment requir electr and we got to look at thi challeng comprehens __PUNCT__
we still have a problem in women and minor to enter scienc and engin __PUNCT__
and let do a better job of replic educ excel in math and scienc from school to school __PUNCT__
congress recent pass into law the america compet act which contain two of my propos __PUNCT__
on would studi promis practic in math and scienc educ __PUNCT__
we have to quit reinvent the wheel __PUNCT__ if someth work in a school __PUNCT__ especi where children come from disadvantag background __PUNCT__ to light their face up __PUNCT__ get them involv __PUNCT__ let replic it __PUNCT__
let work to do what we can to make sure that someth happen in new york or lo angel is follow in houston or miami __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and i think that on wai we can help thi is to creat new fellowship at the nation scienc foundat to allow math and scienc profession to becom teacher in high __PUNCT__ need school __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl who as thei ar retir or ar mid __PUNCT__ career ar look for some wai to keep give and thei face the arrai of difficulti and obstacl to becom teacher and i think we have to break through that barrier and give more peopl a chanc to share their enthusiasm __PUNCT__ their life work with our young peopl __PUNCT__
i also propos tripl the number of nation scienc foundat fellowship and increas the size of each award __PUNCT__
nsf fellowship were creat in respons to the space race __PUNCT__
in the decad sinc __PUNCT__ the number of grant ha remain larg unchang despit a three __PUNCT__ fold increas from that time until now in the number of colleg student graduat with scienc and engin degre __PUNCT__
we also __PUNCT__ as we move toward comprehens immigr reform have to onc again open our colleg and univers to student from abroad who wish to studi here and then hopefulli stai here as part of the american innov agenda __PUNCT__
what is happen now is we not accept them and if we do accept them __PUNCT__ we not allow them to stai and work __PUNCT__
so we need to get the best mind from the world onc again come to america __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ we need an apollo __PUNCT__ like effort in clean __PUNCT__ renew energi __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ the presid gave a speech in which he decid to address global warm __PUNCT__ seven year into hi presid __PUNCT__
and what he found __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ is that the rest of the world ha pass him by __PUNCT__
he spoke of aspir goal to reduc green hous ga emiss while peopl around the world includ right here in america actual aspir to tackl the problem __PUNCT__
for nearli seven year __PUNCT__ the administr ha dodg __PUNCT__ deni __PUNCT__ and dissembl on climat chang __PUNCT__
scientist muzzl __PUNCT__
report censor __PUNCT__
accord to a survei of the union of concern scientist from last year __PUNCT__ nearli three quarter of climat scientist felt inappropri interfer with their research wa go on __PUNCT__
on particularli egregi exampl is that of philip a __PUNCT__ coonei __PUNCT__ the former chief of staff at the white hous council on environment qualiti __PUNCT__
a lawyer previous emploi by the american petroleum institut __PUNCT__ he had no scientif background __PUNCT__
nonetheless __PUNCT__ he insist on edit scientif document on climat chang to cast doubt and greater uncertainti than the expert felt warrant __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ the evid ha mount __PUNCT__
i travel to the alaskan arctic as well as to the european arctic with senat mccain on two occas over the last sever year __PUNCT__
we found ourselv in the northernmost inhabit place on earth __PUNCT__ the island of svalbard __PUNCT__ in norwai __PUNCT__
we met with scientist who been studi the arctic and we listen to what thei had to sai __PUNCT__
thei ar see first hand the impact of chang climat __PUNCT__ from invas speci to shift weather pattern to melt polar ic __PUNCT__
and then at point barrow in our most northern part of america in alaska __PUNCT__ we heard from the scientist who have been studi climat chang there for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
as the evid mount __PUNCT__ other countri ar mount a lead in the race to develop the next gener of energi technolog __PUNCT__
nation in europ and elsewher ar work to meet the standard set by kyoto and to creat job in the process __PUNCT__
germani __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ ha made major commit to renew energi __PUNCT__ recent up their target to produc more than on quarter of their energi from renew sourc by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
their approach ha alreadi paid dividend __PUNCT__
in the last two year __PUNCT__ employ in the german renew sector rose by __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
thei expect to creat more than __NUM__ job in renew by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
as a german offici recent told congress __PUNCT__ solar power instal and wind turbin made in germani ar an export hit all over the world __PUNCT__
i believ america can retak the lead __PUNCT__
energi depend and climat chang repres the greatest innov challeng and opportun that american have face in a gener __PUNCT__ we can creat million of green collar job __PUNCT__
i have propos a __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund __PUNCT__ paid for in part by close the tax subsidi and loophol for the oil compani __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ it is almost imposs to imagin but you and i and all the taxpay in america ar still subsid compani that have made the largest profit in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and that no longer make sens __PUNCT__ and we got to move now to take our resourc and put them where we creat a new market __PUNCT__
it might have made sens when oil wa ten dollar a barrel becaus it expens to explor __PUNCT__ it expens to extract __PUNCT__ but that no longer is need __PUNCT__
if we have smart legisl polici __PUNCT__ we would have trigger on a lot of thi __PUNCT__
if the price of oil ever did fall again dramat __PUNCT__ and we did have to provid incent __PUNCT__ we could do so __PUNCT__
but now what we ar miss by fail to provid incent for solar and wind and geotherm and hydrogen and bio __PUNCT__ fuel and the whole arrai of renew resourc mean that we ar fall further and further behind __PUNCT__
the fund i have propos would invest in technolog avail right now to promot conserv __PUNCT__ combat global warm __PUNCT__ and end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
it also fund an energi initi model on darpa __PUNCT__ the energi advanc research project agenc to bring togeth the best mind in the public and the privat sector to think outsid the box __PUNCT__ and the tank __PUNCT__ to imagin new solut __PUNCT__
win the __NUM__ centuri energi race is as import and potenti profit as win the __NUM__ centuri space race __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ the strateg energi fund is onli the begin __PUNCT__
in the come week __PUNCT__ i will outlin in more detail my plan as presid to move toward energi independ __PUNCT__
instead of lead the world in oil import __PUNCT__ we can lead in green technolog export __PUNCT__
the countri that split the atom can end our depend on foreign oil and launch an energi revolut __PUNCT__
