ga tax ha becom the defin issu in thi primari and in north carolina __PUNCT__
you and sen __PUNCT__ john mccain call for suspend the __NUM__ cent feder ga tax __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ barack __PUNCT__ obama call it a gimmick __PUNCT__
he sai it pander __PUNCT__
he sai it won't realli bring ani help to consum __PUNCT__ and he also said thi __PUNCT__
what your respons __PUNCT__ he sai you not be truth __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
__NUM__ my propos is veri differ from sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ mccain ha said take off the ga tax __PUNCT__ don't pai for it __PUNCT__ throw us further into deficit and debt __PUNCT__
that is not what i propos __PUNCT__
what i propos is that the oil compani pai the ga tax instead of consum and driver thi summer __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ why am i propos thi __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
__NUM__ i am absolut convinc that these record profit of the oil compani ar a result of a number of factor beyond suppli and demand __PUNCT__
i think there ha been market manipul __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ exxon mobil offici testifi under oath befor the hous of repres committe said that if it were just market factor __PUNCT__ then the price of oil would be like __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__
we know that there market manipul go on __PUNCT__
so i would launch an investig if i were presid right now by the depart of justic and the feder trade commiss __PUNCT__
i would also quit bui oil for the strateg petroleum reserv __PUNCT__
we __NUM__ percent full __PUNCT__
we don't need to keep bui it at these price __PUNCT__ and i would releas some __PUNCT__
i would begin to go directli at opec __PUNCT__
i think it been __NUM__ year where we __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ larg just been at the merci of the opec countri __PUNCT__
but thi ga tax issu to me is veri real __PUNCT__ becaus i am meet peopl across indiana and north carolina who drive for a live __PUNCT__ who commut long distanc __PUNCT__ who would save monei if the oil compani paid thi __MONEY__ billion thi summer __PUNCT__ instead of it come out of the pocket of consum __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ economist sai that not go to happen __PUNCT__
thei sai thi is go to go straight into the profit of the oil compani __PUNCT__
thei not go to actual lower their price __PUNCT__
and the two top leader in the hous ar against it __PUNCT__
nearli everi editori board and economist in the countri ha come out against it __PUNCT__
even a support of your __PUNCT__ paul krugman of the new york time __PUNCT__ call it pointless and disappoint __PUNCT__
can you name on economist __PUNCT__ a credibl economist who support the suspens __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__ i think we been for the last seven year see a tremend amount of govern power and elit opinion basic behind polici that haven't work well for the middl class and hard __PUNCT__ work american __PUNCT__
from the moment i start thi campaign __PUNCT__ i said that i am absolut determin that we go to revers the trend that have been go on in our govern and in our polit system __PUNCT__ becaus what i have seen is that the rich have gotten richer __PUNCT__
a vast major __PUNCT__ i think someth like __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ of the wealth gain over the last seven year have gone to the top __NUM__ percent of wage earner in america __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but can you name an economist who think thi make sens __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i tell you what __PUNCT__ i not go to put my lot in with economist __PUNCT__ becaus i know if we get it right __PUNCT__ if we actual did it right __PUNCT__ if we had a presid who us all the tool of the presid __PUNCT__ we would design it in such a wai that it would be implement effect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i have long __PUNCT__ term plan too __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ it a misnom to sai thi is all that i do __PUNCT__
it not __PUNCT__
i have a comprehens long __PUNCT__ term energi plan that would go right at depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
we got to undermin thi incred addict that we have __PUNCT__
we us more foreign oil todai than we did on 9/11 __PUNCT__
that is a disast for america __PUNCT__
also that we got to move toward more altern and renew fuel __PUNCT__ and get out ga mileag up __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ increas those standard __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but that on of the problem here __PUNCT__
you alreadi spent __PUNCT__ accord to our research __PUNCT__ the windfal profit tax on thi strateg energi fund for renew energi and altern energi __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ the tax subsidi __PUNCT__ the tax subsidi will go right into that __PUNCT__
i talk about someth temporari thi summer __PUNCT__
my longer __PUNCT__ term plan is __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ to put an excess profit tax on the oil compani abov a certain level of profit that would go in to help us make the transit __PUNCT__
but let step back here a minut __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ it realli odd to me that argu to give relief to the vast major of american creat thi incred pushback __PUNCT__
when the feder govern __PUNCT__ through the fed and the treasuri __PUNCT__ gave __MONEY__ billion in a bailout to bear stearn __PUNCT__ i didn't hear anybodi jump up and sai __PUNCT__ that not go accord to the market __PUNCT__
that reward irrespons behavior __PUNCT__
we got to get out of thi mindset where somehow elit opinion is alwai on the side of do thing that realli disadvantag the vast major of american __PUNCT__ and get back at look hard at what we go to do to stop the hous crisi __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ for month now __PUNCT__ i been sai we need a moratorium on home foreclosur and we need to freez interest rate __PUNCT__
i think that would help us stem what happen in not just the hous market __PUNCT__ but the gener declin in the economi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we can't get that through the congress either __PUNCT__
and on health care __PUNCT__ on so mani of these issu where cost have gone up __PUNCT__ where peopl ar realli feel squeez __PUNCT__ there just doesn't seem to be an understand about what peopl ar go through __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ let me go to on of the voter who feel squeez __PUNCT__
kara glennan __PUNCT__ phonet spell __PUNCT__ is here __PUNCT__
kara is a democrat __PUNCT__
she support obama __PUNCT__
i think you contribut __MONEY__ to him __PUNCT__
what your question on the ga tax __PUNCT__ voter question __PUNCT__ i have __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i actual make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ so talk about ga price is not academ for me __PUNCT__
i realli do feel pain at the pump __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ i do feel pander to when you talk about suspend the ga tax __PUNCT__
i don't think that it realli a reason plan __PUNCT__ and call me crazi __PUNCT__ but i actual listen to economist __PUNCT__ becaus i think that thei know what thei studi __PUNCT__
you sai that you have both a short __PUNCT__ and a long __PUNCT__ term plan for our energi consumpt __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ sinc the suspens of the ga tax would encourag continu overconsumpt __PUNCT__ which could possibl cancel out ani price save and also undermin our effort to curb global warm __PUNCT__ and your long __PUNCT__ term plan includ try to __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ curb global warm __PUNCT__ don't you feel that these two plan ar in conflict __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
and let me stand up __PUNCT__ becaus i can see you better from thi angl __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ i glad you ask thi question __PUNCT__ becaus i want to make it veri clear that we talk about short __PUNCT__ term relief and a long __PUNCT__ term plan __PUNCT__
and i have a veri comprehens __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ term plan to reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ increas the mileag of our automobil __PUNCT__ and to do it in a wai that will push us forward as a leader in the world again __PUNCT__ which we have not been __PUNCT__ on the issu of global warm __PUNCT__
and i invit everyon to go to my web site __PUNCT__ __URL__ and read about it __PUNCT__
but if you ar drive on averag in america thi summer __PUNCT__ you save __PUNCT__ accord to depart of energi figur __PUNCT__ about __MONEY__
if you ar a long __PUNCT__ distanc commut __PUNCT__ and a lot of peopl in indiana and north carolina ar __PUNCT__ if you ar a truck driver who depend upon your truck for your live __PUNCT__ you go to save a lot more __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ trucker will save about __MONEY__ billion in fuel cost __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i realli believ we got to start right now demonstr a willing to take on these oil compani __PUNCT__
i vote against the big oil giveawai in the __NUM__ energi bill __PUNCT__
my oppon vote for it __PUNCT__
i on record as take on the oil compani __PUNCT__
and i think have a good debat __PUNCT__ like we have right now in thi campaign __PUNCT__ help to lai the groundwork for what we go to need to do __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ let me bring thi back to sen __PUNCT__ obama and what he said there __PUNCT__
he said you weren't be truth __PUNCT__
and that seem to be go straight at the achil heel of your campaign __PUNCT__
our recent poll show six out of __NUM__ voter think you dishonest __PUNCT__
that a heavi burden to carri into the gener elect __PUNCT__
what do you sai to democrat who ar worri about that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ it troubl that peopl would have that opinion __PUNCT__ becaus i think most of the peopl who have vote for me and support me in new york __PUNCT__ and i wa reelect with __NUM__ percent of the vote __PUNCT__ believ thei can count on me __PUNCT__
and thei have good reason to count on me __PUNCT__ becaus i gotten up year after year __PUNCT__ go back mani year __PUNCT__ to stand up for controversi issu __PUNCT__ like health care for everi american __PUNCT__ someth that i feel passion about __PUNCT__
so have i drawn a lot of fire from peopl who have come right at me and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ done a lot of attack of me __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
but i think that goe with be a leader __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i just have a fundament disagr about how you get chang in america __PUNCT__
i wish that we could all just get togeth and decid we go to make chang __PUNCT__
i wish that were the case __PUNCT__
but mayb i know enough about human natur and about our polit system to understand __PUNCT__ you realli have to take these interest on __PUNCT__
thei do not go gentli into the night __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but don't voter have to trust you as you take these interest on __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the voter of new york have trust me twice __PUNCT__ and i think that peopl throughout thi campaign __PUNCT__ as i have campaign across texa __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__ indiana __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__ have seen me in person __PUNCT__ as oppos to what thei hear about me __PUNCT__
and i know you hear a lot about me __PUNCT__
there is a lot out there that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i have no control over __PUNCT__
but if you realli look at what i done and where i stand __PUNCT__ i have a consist record of stand up for peopl and fight for peopl and get result for peopl __PUNCT__ and that what i would do as your presid __PUNCT__
