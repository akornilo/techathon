the labor movement chang america for the better __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ martin luther king __PUNCT__ jr __PUNCT__ sum up labor signific befor an afl __PUNCT__ cio gather much like thi on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the labor movement __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ wa the princip forc that transform miseri and despair into hope and progress __PUNCT__
when the wave of union organ crest over the nation __PUNCT__ it carri to secur shore not onli itself __PUNCT__ but the whole societi __PUNCT__
these word remind us that when dr __PUNCT__ king wa taken from us __NUM__ year ago thi week __PUNCT__ we lost a power voic for justic of all kind __PUNCT__ includ econom justic __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ king knew that union help make the american dream a realiti for million of american __PUNCT__

when other countri exploit their own worker to get them an unfair advantag __PUNCT__ we need union stand up for worker right here and around the world __PUNCT__
no on know better than our union what it mean to fight for the underdog __PUNCT__
everi dai __PUNCT__ you ar stand up for worker who need someon to stand up with them __PUNCT__
and i in thi race for the veri same reason __PUNCT__ to fight for everyon who need a champion in their corner __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ thi campaign is not about me __PUNCT__ thi campaign is about all of us __PUNCT__
thi campaign is meant to repudi the polit philosophi and the govern of the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
becaus our current presid and vice presid have a veri differ view of america __PUNCT__
thei honestli believ that somehow it work best for america when we keep give more to those who alreadi have more than enough __PUNCT__ and that we take awai from those who ar struggl just to get to the level of subsist and possibl __PUNCT__
that why thei gave big tax break to oil compani make record profit __PUNCT__ while you pai through the roof at the pump __PUNCT__
i met with a group of truck driver in harrisburg yesterdai __PUNCT__
thei ar pretti fed up with high fuel price and thei were make their opinion known __PUNCT__
who is listen __PUNCT__ i listen __PUNCT__ but it doesn't seem like the white hous is listen __PUNCT__
the presid is too busi hold hand with the saudi to care about american truck driver who can't afford to fill up their tank ani longer __PUNCT__
i meet worker all over pennsylvania and elsewher who lost their pension __PUNCT__ thei have seen compani go into bankruptci and discharg their oblig __PUNCT__
we have a vice presid __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ when he wa ceo of halliburton which now get all these no bid contract __PUNCT__ don't thei __PUNCT__ from the govern __PUNCT__ worker lost __MONEY__ billion in pension __PUNCT__
but dick chenei got to strap on a golden parachut worth __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
you get tax break to peopl who don't need them while our children get stuck with the bill __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i never thought i sai thi but ever sinc my husband got out of full time public servic __PUNCT__ he actual made monei __PUNCT__ much to both of our amaz __PUNCT__
but i have to confess __PUNCT__ as recipi of all of georg bush tax break __PUNCT__ i can tell you i didn't need them __PUNCT__ i didn't want them __PUNCT__ i didn't ask for them __PUNCT__
and when i am presid __PUNCT__ we go to take those back from peopl make over __MONEY__ a year in america __PUNCT__
and ha there ever been in recent histori a more anti __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ labor presid and white hous __PUNCT__ thei ar not just look for the union label __PUNCT__ thei ar look to squash the union bug __PUNCT__
thei want to elimin union and union worker __PUNCT__ it ideolog __PUNCT__ it person __PUNCT__
after seven disastr year of georg bush and dick chenei __PUNCT__ the stake in thi elect couldn't be higher __PUNCT__
and the need to chang cours couldn't be more urgent __PUNCT__
but i am here to tell you __PUNCT__ senat john mccain __PUNCT__ a friend of mine __PUNCT__ someon whose servic to our countri i admir __PUNCT__ is onli offer more of the same __PUNCT__
john mccain admit he doesn't understand the economi __PUNCT__ and unfortun he prove that dai after dai on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
he look at the hous crisi __PUNCT__ and he blame consum __PUNCT__
hi plan for the economi is to extend georg bush tax cut for billionair and give a __MONEY__ billion addit corpor tax cut __PUNCT__
the bush/mccain philosophi could not be clearer __PUNCT__ it the __PUNCT__ ownership societi __PUNCT__ which realli mean __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
if you not a croni __PUNCT__ if you not wealthi __PUNCT__ if you not well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ you fend for yourself __PUNCT__ the other ar taken care of it __PUNCT__
but don't take just my word for it __PUNCT__
even a republican senat mel martinez from florida after listen to senat mccain econom pan gave it an __PUNCT__ incomplet __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ where i think he fell short __PUNCT__ is the fact that we need to do some thing that can help famili __PUNCT__ that can help peopl __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ duh __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__ we do __PUNCT__
we need to do someth that can help the american peopl for a chang __PUNCT__ put the middl class back into the driver seat __PUNCT__
give our famili the opportun thei deserv __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ sometim when that phone ring at __TIME__ in the white hous it an econom crisi __PUNCT__
it seem like john mccain would just let it ring and ring and ring __PUNCT__
well that not good enough for the famili that i have met across pennsylvania __PUNCT__
i wa with a group of famili in harrisburg yesterdai at a diner __PUNCT__ sit around talk __PUNCT__
what were thei concern about __PUNCT__ the high price of ga __PUNCT__ lose their home to foreclosur __PUNCT__ be abl to afford to send or keep a child in colleg __PUNCT__ wonder where that next job is go to come from __PUNCT__
these ar the stori and concern that ar on the mind of the peopl here in pennsylvania __PUNCT__
i think we had enough of a presid who didn't know enough about econom __PUNCT__ and didn't do enough for the american middl class __PUNCT__
we readi for a presid who will meet the challeng of our time __PUNCT__
now i know take on senat mccain in __DATE__ won't be easi __PUNCT__

next __PUNCT__ we go to stop outsourc our govern to privat compani that ar too often less qualifi __PUNCT__ and less account and actual cost more __PUNCT__
why on earth would we pai a privat contractor more to do what a govern employe wa do better for less __PUNCT__ and let me just sai thi __PUNCT__ i am deepli concern about acceler of the outsourc of product for essenti defens materi __PUNCT__
i wa in indiana the last coupl of dai of last week __PUNCT__ everywher i went talk to good hardwork hoosier __PUNCT__ i heard about how compani after compani that us to do defens work had either lost the work or the compani wa gone __PUNCT__

how will i pai for that __PUNCT__ take the tax subsidi awai from the oil compani and put them to work in clean renew energi __PUNCT__
thi is anoth critic differ between me and my democrat oppon __PUNCT__
my oppon talk about clean energi on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ but when he had a chanc to do someth about it in the senat __PUNCT__ rememb where i come from __PUNCT__ my dad wa from scranton __PUNCT__ action speak louder than word __PUNCT__ when he had a chanc to do someth about it he actual vote for dick chenei energi bill __PUNCT__
i vote against it __PUNCT__
onc again __PUNCT__ when it wa time to turn talk into action __PUNCT__ hi promis were just word __PUNCT__
we have to be smart and tough at the same time __PUNCT__ it not go to be easi to take on the oil compani and the oil produc countri __PUNCT__
but i readi to do it and with your help start on __DATE__ that is just what i will do __PUNCT__
we go to make trade work for american famili __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i been critic by both presid bush and senat obama for thi __PUNCT__ but i believ we need a time __PUNCT__ out on new trade deal __PUNCT__
i been sai that for some time now __PUNCT__
we got to have new trade polici befor we have new trade deal __PUNCT__
that includ no trade deal with columbia while violenc against trade unionist continu in that countri __PUNCT__
i appreci gerri talk about how i did speak out and oppos nafta __PUNCT__ the presid made a differ decis but whether it presid mcente or david gergen or the peopl that were in those meet in the white hous __PUNCT__ thei know that i rais a big yellow caution flag __PUNCT__ i said i not sure that thi will work __PUNCT__
and i have a plan to fix nafta __PUNCT__ with the strongest possibl labor and environment standard in the core text of the agreement __PUNCT__
and unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i will never come to pennsylvania and tell the peopl here on thing while my staff sai someth els to a foreign govern __PUNCT__
you won't find me sai anyth like that __PUNCT__
when i sai i fix nafta __PUNCT__ i mean it __PUNCT__ and i will back it up with action __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we will final get tough on china __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ china steel come here and our job go there __PUNCT__
i testifi befor the intern trade commiss to try to put the break on the dump of steel in our market __PUNCT__
thei manipul their currenc __PUNCT__ thei give illeg subsidi __PUNCT__ thei abus worker __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
and what do we get in return __PUNCT__ taint fish __PUNCT__ lead __PUNCT__ lace toi __PUNCT__ and poison pet food and pollut pharmaceut __PUNCT__
that is a bad deal for america __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ china will be a trade partner not a trade master __PUNCT__
and we go to get that done __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we go to start invest in manufactur again __PUNCT__
pennsylvania ha lost __NUM__ manufactur job in the past year __PUNCT__ nearli on __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ four manufactur job sinc georg bush becam presid __PUNCT__
manufactur thrive in pennsylvania throughout the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it can thrive again __PUNCT__
i disagre with peopl who sai we can't be a manufactur compani again becaus i believ you can't have a strong economi if you don't make thing __PUNCT__
i don't believ you can support all these other job that you repres worker in if you not gener job from actual produc thing __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ for me __PUNCT__ it not just a question of what nice __PUNCT__ it critic and essenti that we bring manufactur back __PUNCT__
we also need it for our defens sector __PUNCT__ as i mention earlier __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ there go to be a lot of work to be done and we go to have a veri progress agenda for work famili __PUNCT__
i will provid health care for everi bodi __PUNCT__ not leav ani on out __PUNCT__
becaus it is long past time that we had afford health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
and the big differ between me and my democrat oppon __PUNCT__
i sure tomorrow he tell you he ha a plan for univers health care __PUNCT__ but hi plan would leav out __NUM__ million peopl __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ here in pennsylvania __PUNCT__
you go to leav out a member of the painter union or a member of their famili __PUNCT__ ar you go to leav out someon who is alreadi sick __PUNCT__ you go to leav out somebodi who is make minimum wage __PUNCT__ he chose to leav health care on the bargain tabl when put togeth hi campaign __PUNCT__
i not just go to talk about univers health care __PUNCT__ i go to get it done __PUNCT__
and the reason i am is becaus i am passion commit to make our countri do what we have not done both moral and econom __PUNCT__
i could tell you hundr of stori and i bet all of you could __PUNCT__
you ar so fortun to have health care becaus you a member of a union and peopl negoti for it __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ i wa in ohio __PUNCT__ along the ohio river dure that campaign __PUNCT__ i realli like how that ohio primari turn out by the wai __PUNCT__ and what i heard wa thi typic tragic stori __PUNCT__ the kind of stori i heard for __NUM__ year and even longer go back to arkansa __PUNCT__
i wa eat in a mobil with some folk in the area __PUNCT__ the deputi sheriff __PUNCT__
he said i sure hope we can get health care for everyon and he told me about a young woman from that town __PUNCT__
she work at the local pizza parlor __PUNCT__
she didn't have anyon repres her __PUNCT__
she got paid minimum wage __PUNCT__ she didn't have anybodi sai you know __PUNCT__ minimum wage is a poverti wage __PUNCT__ you can't make a live on minimum wage __PUNCT__
she got pregnant and she wa have troubl so she went to the nearest hospit __PUNCT__
and i don't blame the hospit __PUNCT__ but thei said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we can't do anymor free care __PUNCT__
you from a neighbor town __PUNCT__ there wa no hospit in her counti __PUNCT__ you have to give us a __MONEY__ befor we exam you __PUNCT__
she didn't have __MONEY__
she went home __PUNCT__
a littl while later __PUNCT__ she wa still have troubl __PUNCT__
she went back to the hospit and thei told her the same thing __PUNCT__
the third time she went to the hospit __PUNCT__ she wa in an ambul __PUNCT__
