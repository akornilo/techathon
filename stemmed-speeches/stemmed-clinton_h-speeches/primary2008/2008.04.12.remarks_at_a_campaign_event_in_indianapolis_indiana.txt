hillari clinton deliv the follow remark at a campaign event in indianapoli __PUNCT__ indiana __PUNCT__ i grew up in the midwest __PUNCT__
born in chicago __PUNCT__ rais outsid of that great citi __PUNCT__
i wa rais with midwestern valu and an unshak faith in america and it promis __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ like some of you mai have been __PUNCT__ i wa taken aback by the demean remark senat obama made about peopl in small town america __PUNCT__
senat obama remark ar elitist and thei ar out of touch __PUNCT__
thei ar not reflect of the valu and belief of american __PUNCT__
certainli not the american that i know __PUNCT__ not the american i grew up with __PUNCT__ not the american i live with in arkansa or repres in new york __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ american who believ in the second amend believ it a matter of constitut right __PUNCT__
american who believ in god believ it is a matter of person faith __PUNCT__
american who believ in protect good american job believ it is a matter of the american dream __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ when my dad grew up it wa in a work class famili in scranton __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ the peopl of faith i know don't __PUNCT__ cling to __PUNCT__ religion becaus thei bitter __PUNCT__
peopl embrac faith not becaus thei ar materi poor __PUNCT__ but becaus thei ar spiritu rich __PUNCT__
our faith is the faith of our parent and our grandpar __PUNCT__
it is a fundament express of who we ar and what we believ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i also disagre with senat obama assert that peopl in thi countri __PUNCT__ cling to gun __PUNCT__ and have certain attitud about immigr or trade simpli out of frustrat __PUNCT__
peopl of all walk of life hunt __PUNCT__ and thei enjoi do so becaus it an import part of their life __PUNCT__ not becaus thei ar bitter __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and as i travel across indiana and i talk to a lot of peopl __PUNCT__ what i hear ar real concern about unfair trade practic that cost peopl job __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think hardwork american ar right to want to see chang in our trade law __PUNCT__
that what i have said __PUNCT__
that what i have fought for __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i would also point out that the vast major of work american reject anti __PUNCT__ immigr rhetor __PUNCT__
thei want reform so that we remain a nation of immigr __PUNCT__ but also a nation of law that we enforc and we enforc fairli __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ american ar fair __PUNCT__ mind and good __PUNCT__ heart peopl __PUNCT__
we have up and down __PUNCT__
we face challeng and problem __PUNCT__
but our view ar root in real valu __PUNCT__ and thei should be respect __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ american out across our countri have born the brunt of the bush administr assault on the middl class __PUNCT__
contrari to what senat obama sai __PUNCT__ most american did much better dure the clinton year than thei have done dure the bush year __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if we ar strive to bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__ and i believ we should be __PUNCT__ i don't think it help to divid our countri into on america that is enlighten and on that is not __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we know there is an unaccept econom divid in america todai __PUNCT__ but that is certainli not the wai to bridg it __PUNCT__
the wai to do that is to roll up our sleev and get to work and make sure we provid __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ econom opportun and share prosper for all american __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ peopl don't need a presid who look down on them __PUNCT__ thei need a presid who stand up for them __PUNCT__
and that is exactli what i will do as your presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ becaus i believ if you want to be the presid of all american __PUNCT__ you need to respect all american __PUNCT__
and that start with respect our hard work american __PUNCT__ and what we need to do here is to take a lesson from allison transmiss __PUNCT__
