and we have had more peopl engag and volunt __PUNCT__ cast their ballot __PUNCT__ than ever befor __PUNCT__
everywher i go __PUNCT__ peopl tell me __PUNCT__ i never given monei to a campaign in my life __PUNCT__ thi year is differ __PUNCT__
i never follow an elect befor __PUNCT__ thi time i can't stop watch __PUNCT__

with our economi in crisi __PUNCT__ and with two war and our children futur in the balanc __PUNCT__ more peopl than ever befor ar take polit serious __PUNCT__
i happen to welcom that becaus thi is a democraci __PUNCT__ and we all got to particip __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we want more democraci __PUNCT__ not less democraci __PUNCT__
we want more peopl take a part in the select of their presid __PUNCT__
here in florida __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ million peopl cast their vote __PUNCT__ the highest primari turnout in the histori of florida __PUNCT__
and nearli __NUM__ voter in michigan did the same __PUNCT__
and not a dai goe by that i don't meet someon who grab my hand or hold up a sign __PUNCT__ no matter where i am __PUNCT__ in kentucki or anywher els __PUNCT__ and sai __PUNCT__ pleas __PUNCT__ make my vote count __PUNCT__
i receiv dozen and dozen of letter and email and phone call __PUNCT__ everi coupl of hour it seem like __PUNCT__ all make the same urgent request __PUNCT__ pleas count my vote __PUNCT__
we us to be worri about voter apathi __PUNCT__ didn't we __PUNCT__ we worri why american didn't particip __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ peopl ar worri that their particip won't matter __PUNCT__
i believ the democrat parti must count these vote __PUNCT__
thei should count them exactli as thei were cast __PUNCT__
democraci demand no less __PUNCT__
i am here todai becaus i believ that the decis our parti face is not just about the fate of these vote and the outcom of these primari __PUNCT__
it is about whether we will uphold our most fundament valu as democrat and american __PUNCT__
it is about whether we will move forward __PUNCT__ unit __PUNCT__ to win thi state and take back the white hous thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that ha to be the prize that we keep in mind __PUNCT__
becaus here in america __PUNCT__ unlik in mani other nation __PUNCT__ we ar bound togeth __PUNCT__ not by a singl share religion or cultur heritag __PUNCT__ but by a share set of idea and ideal __PUNCT__ a share civic faith __PUNCT__ that we ar entitl to speak and worship freeli __PUNCT__ that we deserv equal justic under the law __PUNCT__ that we have certain core right that no govern can abridg and these right ar root in and sustain by the principl that our founder set forth in the declar of independ __PUNCT__
that a just govern deriv it power from the consent of the govern __PUNCT__ that each of us should have an equal voic in determin the destini of our nation __PUNCT__
a gener of patriot risk and sacrif live on the battlefield for that ideal __PUNCT__
the union thei ultim form wa far from perfect __PUNCT__
it exclud mani of our citizen __PUNCT__ peopl like congresswoman brown __PUNCT__ me __PUNCT__ my daughter __PUNCT__
but it wa an ideal that set forth a goal that we have consist work for __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ in each success gener __PUNCT__ thi nation wa bless by men and women who refus to accept their assign place as second __PUNCT__ class citizen __PUNCT__
men and women who saw america not as it wa __PUNCT__ but as it could and should be __PUNCT__ and commit themselv to extend the frontier of our democraci __PUNCT__
the abolitionist and all who fought to end slaveri and ensur freedom came with the full right of citizenship __PUNCT__
the tenaci women and a few brave men who gather at the seneca fall convent back in __NUM__ to demand the right to vote __PUNCT__
it took more than __NUM__ year of struggl __PUNCT__ setback __PUNCT__ and grind hard work and onli on of those origin suffragist live to see women cast their ballot __PUNCT__
there ar women here todai __PUNCT__ as with my own mother __PUNCT__ who were born befor the constitut grant us the right to vote __PUNCT__
thi is not someth lost in the mist of memori and histori __PUNCT__ thi is real __PUNCT__
the gener here in thi room have seen chang __PUNCT__
the men and women who knew their constitut right to vote meant littl when poll tax and literaci test __PUNCT__ violenc __PUNCT__ and intimid made it imposs to exercis their right __PUNCT__ so thei march and protest __PUNCT__ face dog and tear ga __PUNCT__ knelt down on that bridg in selma to prai and were beaten within an inch of their live __PUNCT__
some gave their live to the struggl for a more perfect union __PUNCT__
there is a reason why so mani have fought so hard and sacrif so much __PUNCT__
it is becaus thei knew that to be a citizen of thi countri is to have the right and respons to help shape it futur __PUNCT__ not just to make your voic heard __PUNCT__ but to have it count __PUNCT__
peopl have fought hard becaus thei knew their vote wa at stake and so wa their children futur __PUNCT__
becaus of those who have come befor __PUNCT__ senat obama and i and so mani of you have thi preciou right todai __PUNCT__
becaus of all that ha been done __PUNCT__ we ar in thi histor presidenti elect __PUNCT__
i believ that both senat obama and myself have an oblig as potenti democrat nomine __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ we all have an oblig as democrat __PUNCT__ to carri on thi legaci and ensur that in our nomin process everi voic is heard and everi singl vote is count __PUNCT__
thi work to extend the franchis to all of our citizen is a core mission of the modern democrat parti __PUNCT__ from sign the vote right act and fight racial discrimin at the ballot box __PUNCT__ to lower the vote ag so those old enough to fight and die in war would have the right to choos their command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ to fight for multi __PUNCT__ lingual ballot so you can make your voic heard no matter what languag you speak __PUNCT__
i am proud of our work todai __PUNCT__
we ar fight the redistrict initi that would dilut african american and latino vote __PUNCT__
we ar fight effort to purg voter from the roll here in florida and elsewher __PUNCT__
we ar fight voter identif law that could wrongli keep ten of thousand of voter from cast their ballot thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we carri on thi caus for a simpl reason __PUNCT__ becaus we believ the outcom of our elect should be determin by the will of the peopl __PUNCT__ noth more __PUNCT__ noth less __PUNCT__
we believ the popular vote is the truest express of your will __PUNCT__
we believ it todai __PUNCT__ just as we believ it back in __NUM__ when right here in florida __PUNCT__ you learn the hard wai what happen when your vote aren't count and the candid with fewer vote is declar the winner __PUNCT__
the lesson of __NUM__ here in florida is crystal clear __PUNCT__
if ani vote aren't count __PUNCT__ the will of the peopl is not realiz and our democraci is diminish __PUNCT__
that is what i have alwai believ __PUNCT__
my first job in polit wa on the __NUM__ presidenti campaign regist african __PUNCT__ american and hispan voter in texa __PUNCT__
that work took me from home to home in neighborhood after neighborhood __PUNCT__
i wa determin to knock on everi door and sign up everi voter i could find __PUNCT__
while we mai not have won that elect __PUNCT__ i have never given up the fight __PUNCT__
it is a fight i continu to thi dai __PUNCT__
becaus i think it is appal that in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ voter ar still be wrongli turn awai from the poll __PUNCT__ ballot ar still mysteri lost in state after state __PUNCT__ african __PUNCT__ american and hispan voter still wait in line for hour while voter in the same state __PUNCT__ even in the same counti can wait just minut to cast their vote __PUNCT__
that why i been work sinc __NUM__ with my dear friend congresswoman stephani tubb jone to pass the count everi vote act __PUNCT__ comprehens vote right legisl design to end these deplor violat __PUNCT__
it will ensur that everi elig voter can vote __PUNCT__ everi vote is count __PUNCT__ and everi vote can verifi hi or her vote befor it is final cast __PUNCT__
i will continu to fight for that same principl everi dai in thi campaign __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ the peopl of florida vote back in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
you did your part __PUNCT__
you show up in record number and you made inform choic __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ some month later __PUNCT__ you still do not know if these vote will help determin our parti nomine __PUNCT__
you still don't know if thi great state will be repres at our convent in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
it is time you knew __PUNCT__ becaus the more than __NUM__ million peopl who vote in florida and michigan exercis their fundament american right in good faith __PUNCT__
you watch the new __PUNCT__
you went to the candid __PUNCT__ web site __PUNCT__ you talk to your friend and neighbor __PUNCT__ you learn about our record and polici so you could make inform vote decis __PUNCT__
you didn't break a singl rule __PUNCT__ and you should not be punish for matter beyond your control __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know that senat obama chose to remov hi name from the ballot in michigan __PUNCT__ and that wa hi right __PUNCT__
but hi choic doe not negat the vote of all those who turn out to cast their ballot __PUNCT__ and we should not let our process rob them and all of you of your voic __PUNCT__
to do so would undermin the veri purpos of the nomin process __PUNCT__
to ensur that as mani democrat as possibl can cast their vote __PUNCT__
to ensur that the parti select a nomine who truli repres the will of the voter and to ensur that the democrat take back the white hous to rebuild america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i heard some sai that count florida and michigan would be chang the rule __PUNCT__
i sai that not count florida and michigan is chang a central govern rule of thi countri __PUNCT__ that whenev we can understand the clear intent of the voter __PUNCT__ their vote should be count __PUNCT__
i rememb veri well back in __NUM__ there were those who argu that peopl vote should be discount over technic __PUNCT__
for the peopl of florida who vote in thi primari __PUNCT__ the notion of discount their vote sound wai too much of the same __PUNCT__
the vote of __NUM__ million peopl should not be cast asid becaus of a technic __PUNCT__
the peopl who vote did noth wrong __PUNCT__ and it would be wrong to punish you __PUNCT__
as the florida suprem court said back in __NUM__ befor the unit state suprem court took the case awai from them __PUNCT__ as your suprem court said __PUNCT__ it not about the technic or about the contest __PUNCT__
it about the will of the peopl __PUNCT__
and whenev you can understand their intent __PUNCT__ it should govern __PUNCT__
it veri clear what __NUM__ million peopl intend here in florida __PUNCT__
plai a role in the nomin process in a two __PUNCT__ parti system is just as import as have a vote in the presidenti elect on elect dai count __PUNCT__
we know it wa wrong to penal voter for the decis of state offici back in the __NUM__ presidenti elect __PUNCT__
it would be wrong to do so for decis made in our nomin process __PUNCT__
democrat argu passion __PUNCT__
we ar still argu __PUNCT__ aren't we __PUNCT__ for count all the vote back in __NUM__ and we should be just as passion argu for that principl todai __PUNCT__ here in florida and in michigan __PUNCT__
it is well within the democrat parti rule to take thi stand __PUNCT__
the rule clearli state that we can count all of these vote and seat all of these deleg __PUNCT__ pledg and unpledg __PUNCT__ if we so choos __PUNCT__
and the rule lai out a clear process for do so __PUNCT__
with thi process __PUNCT__ if hope we will honor the will of those who came out to cast vote __PUNCT__
think of how that dai wa __PUNCT__
worker who rush to the poll between shift __PUNCT__ student who came between class __PUNCT__ parent who rearrang their famili schedul __PUNCT__ senior citizen who arrang transport to the poll __PUNCT__ all so you could have your vote count __PUNCT__
and whether you vote for better school for your kid or a secur retir for your parent __PUNCT__ for job you can rais a famili on __PUNCT__ for health care you can afford __PUNCT__ to bring your son __PUNCT__ your grandson __PUNCT__ your daughter or your granddaught back from iraq or bring back america reput in the world __PUNCT__
whether you vote for me or senat obama or senat edward or someon els __PUNCT__ each vote you cast is a prayer for our nation __PUNCT__ a declar of your dream for your children and grandchildren __PUNCT__ a reflect of your determin to ensur that our countri live up to it promis __PUNCT__
each vote is a tool __PUNCT__ on us throughout histori to break barrier __PUNCT__ open door __PUNCT__ and widen the circl of opportun __PUNCT__
i rememb when presid lyndon johnson address the congress and the nation urg the passag of the vote right act __PUNCT__
he declar __PUNCT__ i speak tonight for the digniti of man and the destini of democraci __PUNCT__
it wa urgent __PUNCT__ elev languag __PUNCT__ but it wa not hyperbol __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as back then __PUNCT__ those ar the stake __PUNCT__
that why here in florida __PUNCT__ even when you were told your primari might not count __PUNCT__ you vote anywai __PUNCT__
a floridian i know from tallahasse told me about hi mother canasta club __PUNCT__
it a group of women in their golden year who gather everi week to plai card and visit __PUNCT__
thei talk about that florida primari everi week as thei gather around the card tabl __PUNCT__
thei follow the new close __PUNCT__
thei discuss the candid and their posit on the issu __PUNCT__
thei knew about the disput over the primari schedul and the question of seat deleg __PUNCT__
and when it came time to vote __PUNCT__ like so mani other good citizen of thi state __PUNCT__ the ladi of the canasta club dutifulli cast their ballot for the candid of their choic __PUNCT__
thei made inform choic __PUNCT__
thei did noth wrong __PUNCT__ and thei should not be punish for do their civic duti __PUNCT__
you knew then what american know __PUNCT__ that thi polit process of our is about more than the candid run __PUNCT__ the pundit comment or the ad blare __PUNCT__
it about the path we choos as a nation __PUNCT__
if anyon ever doubt whether it matter who our presid wa __PUNCT__ the last seven year with georg bush should have remov everi singl doubt from anyon mind __PUNCT__
that why you vote __PUNCT__ and that why i run __PUNCT__
and that why you been organ and rais your voic __PUNCT__ hope to have your vote count __PUNCT__
you refus to stai home then __PUNCT__ and you refus to stai silent now __PUNCT__
becaus you want to chang america futur and you have faith that your parti __PUNCT__ the democrat parti __PUNCT__ will give you that chanc __PUNCT__
i here todai becaus i believ we should keep that faith __PUNCT__ listen to your voic and count everi singl on of your vote __PUNCT__
if we fail to do so __PUNCT__ i worri that we will pai not onli a moral cost __PUNCT__ but a polit cost as well __PUNCT__
we know the road to a democrat white hous run right through florida and michigan __PUNCT__
and if we care about win those state in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we need to count your vote now __PUNCT__
if democrat send the messag that we don't fulli valu your vote __PUNCT__ we know senat mccain and the republican will be more than happi to have them __PUNCT__
the republican will make a simpl and compel argument __PUNCT__
why should florida and michigan voter trust the democrat parti to look out for you when thei won't even listen to you __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ if you agre with me __PUNCT__ i urg you to go to my websit __PUNCT__ __URL__ and join the more than __NUM__ who have alreadi sign our petit ask the democrat nation committe to count your vote __PUNCT__
all __NUM__ state __PUNCT__ the district of columbia __PUNCT__ puerto rico and the territori will have a chanc to plai a role in thi histor process __PUNCT__
now is not the time for our parti to have a dialogu about which state and which vote should count __PUNCT__
the peopl of florida ar all too familiar with where that discuss can lead __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ we cannot move forward as a unit parti if some member of our parti ar left out __PUNCT__
senat obama and i ar run to be presid of all american and all __NUM__ state __PUNCT__
and i want to be sure that all __NUM__ state ar count and your deleg ar seat at our convent __PUNCT__
