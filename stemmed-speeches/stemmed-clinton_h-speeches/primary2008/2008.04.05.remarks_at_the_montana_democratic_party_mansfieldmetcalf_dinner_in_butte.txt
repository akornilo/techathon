it will not be a moment too soon __PUNCT__
as i have travel across our great countri __PUNCT__ the overwhelm feel that i see express by not just democrat __PUNCT__ but even republican __PUNCT__ independ and peopl who don't frankli get veri much involv in polit __PUNCT__ is that we stand on the cusp of a new begin for america __PUNCT__
if you listen close __PUNCT__ you can almost hear it in the distanc __PUNCT__ the sound of the move van pull awai from the back of the white hous __PUNCT__
we all wish that it would be tomorrow that presid bush would return to that ranch and cut that brush instead of cut back on children health care and cut back on veteran health care and cut back on the futur for our children __PUNCT__
but i believ the whole world will breath a sigh of relief when georg bush and dick chenei final hand over those kei __PUNCT__
but that not when our work end __PUNCT__ that when our work begin __PUNCT__
i don't think we even know how much damag ha been done to our countri by the fail polici and the wrong __PUNCT__ head prioriti of thi administr __PUNCT__
for the past seven year __PUNCT__ presid bush ha conduct a danger experi in extrem __PUNCT__
it ha fail our countri __PUNCT__
he ha had two prioriti __PUNCT__ tax cut for the wealthiest and the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and he hasn't paid for either on of them __PUNCT__
he inherit a balanc budget and a surplu and he leav behind a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
he mortgag our futur with hi reckless spend __PUNCT__ while ignor the problem that continu to pile up __PUNCT__
so here we ar __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ of __NUM__ and we ar borrow monei from the chines to bui oil from the saudi __PUNCT__
i don't believ it is right to stick our children and our grandchildren with the bill for presid bush fail presid __PUNCT__
it will be up to us as democrat to reassert the confid and compet of our countri futur __PUNCT__
i am total optimist __PUNCT__
i know how sever the problem ar that we face __PUNCT__
i understand complet how difficult it will be to turn our countri around __PUNCT__
but there isn't ani problem america can't solv __PUNCT__ there isn't ani challeng we can't meet so long as we start act like american again __PUNCT__ roll up our sleev and get to work togeth __PUNCT__
the contrast could not be greater __PUNCT__ instead of try to solv our problem __PUNCT__ presid bush ha us fear to divid us and fatal to discourag us __PUNCT__
he want us to believ that we can't solv our problem __PUNCT__ and that we shouldn't even try __PUNCT__
move toward energi independ __PUNCT__ well that would wreck our economi __PUNCT__ thei tell us __PUNCT__
move toward univers health care __PUNCT__ well that would wreck our health care system __PUNCT__
sinc when did america becom the can't __PUNCT__ do nation __PUNCT__ as far as i know and the wai i wa rais __PUNCT__ we know that you roll up your sleev and you face the futur realist __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we do have to do what is necessari to take back the futur __PUNCT__
but i am convinc beyond a shadow of a doubt that america is readi __PUNCT__
we ar readi to be call to great again __PUNCT__
we ar readi to be ask to sacrific on behalf of thi countri that we love __PUNCT__
for seven year __PUNCT__ the drug compani __PUNCT__ the insur compani __PUNCT__ the oil compani and wall street have had a presid __PUNCT__ i think it time the american peopl had a presid again __PUNCT__
we need a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief who is readi on dai on to end the war in iraq and keep our children safe __PUNCT__ someon who know how to manag thi economi and strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__
the american peopl need a fighter on their side __PUNCT__ a presid who will get up everi singl dai and work her heart out for you __PUNCT__ for your famili __PUNCT__ for your job and your futur __PUNCT__
i am here tonight becaus i am readi to be that presid __PUNCT__
if there is on word that sum up my campaign and what it all about __PUNCT__ it solut __PUNCT__
i offer real solut __PUNCT__ not just speech __PUNCT__
i want to creat a better futur by make it clear that we have to not onli set out a vision __PUNCT__ we got to know how to get there __PUNCT__
you know that old stori about how our polit parti ar like drive a car __PUNCT__ don't you __PUNCT__ if you want to go forward __PUNCT__ you put it in d __PUNCT__
if you want to go backward __PUNCT__ you put it in r __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we go forward in d __PUNCT__
and here why democrat need to drive that car forward again __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ across montana and across america __PUNCT__ teacher ar grade paper and nurs ar care for the sick __PUNCT__ and thei need a presid who listen to them __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ janitor ar clean up __PUNCT__ and waitress ar pour coffe __PUNCT__ and polic offic ar stand guard __PUNCT__
and thei need a presid who stand with them __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ famili ar sit down around the dinner tabl __PUNCT__ talk about how to keep the farm in the famili or how to keep up with the bill that ar mount __PUNCT__ and thei need a presid who will deliv for them __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ our brave men and women in uniform ar serv across the globe __PUNCT__ some on their second __PUNCT__ their third or their fourth deploy __PUNCT__
and thei deserv a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief who respect them __PUNCT__ who care for them and their famili __PUNCT__ and who bring them home and take care of them onc thei do come back __PUNCT__
american deserv so much better __PUNCT__
i am in thi race to offer those solut __PUNCT__ becaus i believ america best dai ar still ahead of us __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ thi is not just about the next elect __PUNCT__
thi is about the next gener and what we must do to keep faith __PUNCT__ to ensur that our children and our grandchildren have the same bless and opportun that we were given __PUNCT__ to make the most of their own live __PUNCT__ to take the tool that ar the product of a free market and the incred entrepreneuri energi and innov of america and put it to work __PUNCT__ not onli for a better futur for themselv but for our countri and our world __PUNCT__
so when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean an economi that work for everyon __PUNCT__ not just those at the top __PUNCT__
an economi where prosper is share again __PUNCT__ and we creat good job __PUNCT__ job that will rebuild our infrastructur __PUNCT__ job in clean __PUNCT__ renew energi __PUNCT__ job in scienc and research __PUNCT__ job that can support a famili with a middl class standard of live that give peopl hope in the futur that thei ar build for themselv __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean reign in those corpor special interest and rebuild the middl class __PUNCT__
i have propos __MONEY__ billion in middl class tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut that will go for healthcar __PUNCT__ to make colleg afford __PUNCT__ for secur retir __PUNCT__
part of the wai we do that is to take awai the __MONEY__ billion in tax cut that have gone to those who __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ do not need your monei more than you need your monei __PUNCT__
explain to me how it can make ani sens that we have a tax code that still give tax benefit to compani that move job and profit out of montana to foreign countri __PUNCT__
we go to end that __PUNCT__
we go to tell peopl the tax code of the unit state will reflect the patriot invest in job and busi right here __PUNCT__ in order to build a stronger economi __PUNCT__
how is it fair that a wall street monei manag make __MONEY__ million a year pai a lower percentag in tax to our govern than a nurs __PUNCT__ a teacher __PUNCT__ or a truck driver right here in montana pai to that govern of our __PUNCT__ and when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean a return to fiscal respons __PUNCT__
i wa rais by a father who didn't believ in credit __PUNCT__ didn't have a credit card __PUNCT__ didn't bui a hous until he could pai for it __PUNCT__ so i a littl cheap __PUNCT__
but i think that what we need in a presid again __PUNCT__ who start have the feder govern live within our mean __PUNCT__
we go to get back to pai __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ go __PUNCT__ and we go to take a scalpel to that budget and look for anyth we can take out so that we put our prioriti back in __PUNCT__
enough with the no __PUNCT__ bid contract to halliburton and all of those croni compani of georg bush __PUNCT__
there is absolut no evid that outsourc our govern save monei __PUNCT__ but what it doe is line the pocket of those compani and remov account __PUNCT__
back in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ we saw rise incom __PUNCT__
the typic famili saw __MONEY__ in incom that came to them becaus the economi wa move up __PUNCT__
more peopl were lift out of poverti __PUNCT__
it wa a good time for america __PUNCT__
occasion __PUNCT__ in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i hear somebodi critic the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that fair __PUNCT__
but i alwai wonder to myself __PUNCT__ what is it thei didn't like __PUNCT__ the peac __PUNCT__ or the prosper __PUNCT__ i could never figur that part out __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean make our feder govern a partner with rural america __PUNCT__
now i don't want to shock you tonight __PUNCT__ but you mai be surpris to learn that new york is home to __NUM__ famili farm __PUNCT__
i know __PUNCT__ where do thei all go under the empir state build __PUNCT__ but across our state and across so much of rural america __PUNCT__ there is a feel that the deck is stack against famili farm __PUNCT__
i commit to work with your two great senat __PUNCT__ to pass a strong farm bill that work for true famili farm __PUNCT__ with prioriti like perman disast relief __PUNCT__ strengthen countri of origin label __PUNCT__ renew energi advanc __PUNCT__ rural develop __PUNCT__ broadband deploy __PUNCT__
and i want to salut the leadership of senat baucu and senat tester __PUNCT__
thi farm bill need to move and the presid need to get out of the wai so that we can start take care of rural america __PUNCT__
it is great to have senat tester in the congress as a famili farmer and an organ farmer __PUNCT__
he ha been a breath of fresh air __PUNCT__
and of cours we couldn't have a farm bill or nearli ani other bill that actual had ani monei attach to it without senat baucu __PUNCT__
so montana is right in the middl of these debat __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean declar energi independ __PUNCT__
i want america to sign a declar of energi independ __PUNCT__
i want our citizen to sign it becaus there work for all of us to do to move toward energi independ __PUNCT__
it time we declar our independ from foreign oil __PUNCT__
it time we began look for solut from home grown energi __PUNCT__
i want to be a presid who is a good partner for governor schweitzer to help tap into the natur resourc right here in montana __PUNCT__ biofuel __PUNCT__ clean coal __PUNCT__ wind energi __PUNCT__
the futur ha so much potenti but we been go backward __PUNCT__
we ar actual more depend on foreign oil todai than we were on 9/11 __PUNCT__
explain how that make ani sens __PUNCT__
i wa wait for presid bush after 9/11 to sai here how we will respond __PUNCT__ a goal that will move us awai from our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we never heard a word like that and i know we not go to move on clean coal or biofuel or wind or solar or the transmiss and distribut system we need to transport what is creat here elsewher in the countri __PUNCT__
i know we won't do that until the two oil men leav the white hous but as soon as thei do __PUNCT__ let be readi __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will invest in altern energi with a __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund paid for in two wai __PUNCT__ by take the tax subsidi awai from the oil compani __PUNCT__
it is hard to explain how a compani like exxon mobil that make __MONEY__ billion in profit last year need your monei to be success __PUNCT__
and certainli __PUNCT__ when you look at what we need to do __PUNCT__ that __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund __PUNCT__ we also ask the oil compani to be part of the solut instead of the problem __PUNCT__
thei can invest in renew sourc __PUNCT__
thei can clean up their facil to reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ or thei can be subject to a windfal profit tax which we will take and put to work on develop altern renew energi here in montana __PUNCT__
i figur we can creat at least five million new good job and these ar job that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
these ar job that can be done right here in montana __PUNCT__
becaus it is wai pass time for us to stop hold hand with the saudi __PUNCT__ and start hold them account __PUNCT__
that the kind of presid that you can expect me to be __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean it is time to final get tough on china __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ china product come here and our job go there __PUNCT__
we plai by the rule __PUNCT__ thei manipul their currenc __PUNCT__
we get taint fish __PUNCT__ lead __PUNCT__ lace toi __PUNCT__ contamin pet food and pollut pharmaceut __PUNCT__
i think that a raw deal __PUNCT__ and the unit state govern should sai no more __PUNCT__ no how __PUNCT__ we go to have new rule __PUNCT__ thei go to plai by the same rule and we go to stand up for our consum and our worker __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean final provid univers health care __PUNCT__
everi singl american will be cover __PUNCT__
we have two big problem __PUNCT__
we have the problem of __NUM__ million uninsur __PUNCT__ includ more than __NUM__ right here in montana __PUNCT__ and then we have the problem of peopl who ar insur except when it come time to have the insur compani pai the bill __PUNCT__ the insur compani won't pai the doctor or the hospit __PUNCT__
so here what i believ __PUNCT__
if you have health insur and you happi with it __PUNCT__ noth chang __PUNCT__
but if you ar uninsur or underinsur __PUNCT__ we go to open up the congression health plan __PUNCT__
congress ha a plan for itself and feder employe with more than __NUM__ choic __PUNCT__
it cover prevent care __PUNCT__ mental health care __PUNCT__ the kind of comprehens health care that everi american should have access to __PUNCT__
for those who can't afford it __PUNCT__ we go to offer health care tax credit and i would like to see us limit the amount of monei that anyon ever ha to pai for their health care premium to a small percentag of your incom __PUNCT__
and we we go to regul the insur compani so thei not longer can discrimin against peopl __PUNCT__
i think it is wai past time __PUNCT__
in our countri it is unconstitut to discrimin on the basi of race or religion or gender or ethnic origin and that is all for the good __PUNCT__
but insur compani can discrimin against you if you sick or if you ever have been sick __PUNCT__
it time for us to tell the insur compani no more discrimin __PUNCT__ no more make life and death decis __PUNCT__
that should be left to doctor and nurs __PUNCT__ not insur compani bureaucrat __PUNCT__ and we go to move toward univers health care coverag final in america __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean public school that ar worthi of our children __PUNCT__ start with univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten go all the wai through __PUNCT__
i believ you got to start with pre __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ with head start __PUNCT__ earli head start __PUNCT__ univers pre __PUNCT__ k so that all of our children get off to a good begin __PUNCT__
and i will end the unfund mandat known as no child left behind __PUNCT__
i believ in account and i have work for that for more than __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but i don't think you get that by turn our student into littl test taker and our teacher into big test giver __PUNCT__
we need a new partnership __PUNCT__ a new partnership between the feder govern __PUNCT__ our school __PUNCT__ our student __PUNCT__ our famili and commun __PUNCT__
i will offer that __PUNCT__
i will also work to make sure that colleg is afford for everi singl hard work student in america __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean keep faith with our nativ american __PUNCT__ the first american __PUNCT__
it is time that we had a presid who understood that we should fulli fund the indian health servic __PUNCT__ that we should respect the govern __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ govern relationship __PUNCT__ that we will have __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ a partnership from the white hous across america __PUNCT__
everi tribe __PUNCT__ both in indian countri and in urban area __PUNCT__ becaus i believ we must keep faith with our veri first american and i pledg __PUNCT__ i will do whatev i can to make that happen __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean stand up alwai for social secur __PUNCT__
senat baucu led the fight against presid bush attempt to privat social secur __PUNCT__
i wa proud to fight alongsid him everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ you ar never go to have to worri about anybodi privat your social secur __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we have a lot of work to do around the world __PUNCT__
we have to restor america leadership and our moral author __PUNCT__
that begin by end the war in iraq and bring our troop home as quickli and respons as possibl __PUNCT__
it mean reach out to the rest of the world to find common ground to combat our challeng __PUNCT__
we can't tackl global warm alon __PUNCT__ as presid i will lead the wai to a new global agreement that will includ india and china and the other fast develop countri __PUNCT__
everi part of the world must be commit to revers global warm __PUNCT__
when we think about take on global warm or global terror or global epidem __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ must be respect __PUNCT__
you cannot be a leader if no on is follow and for too long under presid bush countri have been on the sidelin or even activ oppos to us __PUNCT__
i will immedi launch comprehens global diplomat effort ask distinguish american of both parti to travel across the world __PUNCT__ to send a messag that onc again the unit state want to engag __PUNCT__ want to listen __PUNCT__ want to work with you __PUNCT__
as we move from the war in iraq to onc again stand on behalf of peac and secur __PUNCT__ we will be bring our son and daughter home __PUNCT__
thei will need a new __NUM__ centuri g.i __PUNCT__
bill of right __PUNCT__ with monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ monei for a home __PUNCT__ monei to start a busi __PUNCT__
it ha been heartbreak as a senat to see how mani of our veteran have been left alon to fight a bureaucraci and cut through the red tape to get the health care thei need __PUNCT__ to get the compens thei deserv __PUNCT__
i will be a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief who recogn that we have the greatest militari in the world but forc should be us as a last resort __PUNCT__ not a first resort in the interest of our countri and further of our valu __PUNCT__
and it almost goe without sai but it must be said __PUNCT__ that we will bring our constitut out of cold storag __PUNCT__
we will restor the separ of power __PUNCT__ the check and balanc __PUNCT__
we will end the abus practic and power grab of the bush/chenei administr __PUNCT__
thi is the america we will build togeth __PUNCT__ an america where the next gener is alwai better off than the last __PUNCT__
but in order to begin to do thi work __PUNCT__ we have to win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that mean we have to defeat senat mccain __PUNCT__ a good man with a great record of serv america __PUNCT__
he a friend and colleagu of mine and i admir hi servic __PUNCT__ but he is offer the wrong idea for our countri __PUNCT__
it is import that in the fall elect we have a nomine readi to go toe __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ toe with john mccain on nation secur __PUNCT__
he is will to keep troop in iraq for up to __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i start bring them home within the first __NUM__ dai of my take offic __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha admit he doesn't realli understand the economi __PUNCT__
and unfortun __PUNCT__ he is prove it in thi campaign __PUNCT__
he look at the home mortgag crisi and who doe he blame __PUNCT__ not wall street __PUNCT__ which help creat thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
he blame the homeown __PUNCT__
he doesn't seem to understand that if our feder govern can find __MONEY__ billion to bail out on firm on wall street __PUNCT__ we ought to be abl to find __MONEY__ billion to help homeown stai in their home and not lose them to the predatori practic of the mortgag industri __PUNCT__
i think we had enough of a presid who didn't know enough about econom and didn't do enough for the american middl class __PUNCT__
we readi for a presid who __PUNCT__ no matter whether that __NUM__ a.m __PUNCT__ call is about nation secur or an econom crisi __PUNCT__ actual answer the phone and doesn't let it ring and ring and ring __PUNCT__ try to avoid take respons for the mess that will be there when georg bush leav __PUNCT__
take back the white hous won't be easi __PUNCT__
you think that after georg bush presid the republican would apolog to america __PUNCT__
it might go someth like thi __PUNCT__ we ar so sorri __PUNCT__
we not even go to run against you thi time __PUNCT__
i don't think that happen __PUNCT__

i know what it like to stumbl __PUNCT__
i know what it mean to get knock down __PUNCT__
but i never stai down __PUNCT__
i never will __PUNCT__
and neither will america __PUNCT__

when the deep copper mine close in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ you found new mine technolog and you kept go __PUNCT__
