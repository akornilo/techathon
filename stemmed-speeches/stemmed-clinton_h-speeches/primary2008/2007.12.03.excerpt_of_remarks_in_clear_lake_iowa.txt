as i have said repeatedli __PUNCT__ i realli would prefer to attack the problem of the countri and let my oppon run their own campaign __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ but i have to set the record straight __PUNCT__
becaus often what you don't know can be far more import than what you do know __PUNCT__
the peopl of iowa __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__ ar good peopl who ar try veri hard to make the right decis in thi caucu __PUNCT__
but peopl can onli act on what thei know __PUNCT__
and i heard a lot of talk about turn the page __PUNCT__ but what about the action to back it up __PUNCT__ when it come to health care __PUNCT__ on of my oppon believ it accept to leav out __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
that would be __NUM__ here in iowa __PUNCT__
leav them out from hi health care plan becaus univers coverag might be too hard to achiev __PUNCT__
i disagre __PUNCT__

i have alwai fought for social secur __PUNCT__ i have alwai stood up against privat __PUNCT__ and as presid __PUNCT__ i will restor fiscal respons so we can keep social secur as a sacr promis to our senior __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ when it come to iran __PUNCT__ i took a stand for aggress diplomaci __PUNCT__
on of my oppon made a differ choic __PUNCT__ he didn't show up for the vote __PUNCT__
he didn't speak out dure a presidenti debat that night __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ he decid to plai polit and claim that the vote he miss __PUNCT__ a vote for diplomaci __PUNCT__ wa realli a vote for war __PUNCT__
well if he realli thought it wa a rush to war __PUNCT__ why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ there been a lot of talk about ye or no answer to complex question __PUNCT__
but most peopl don't know that for legisl who don't want to take a stand __PUNCT__ there a third wai to vote __PUNCT__

seven of those vote were on a woman right to choos __PUNCT__
two of those vote were on measur to protect famili from gun violenc __PUNCT__ on of which wa a measur about fire gun on or near school ground __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ a presid can't vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__
a presid can't pick and choos which challeng he or she will face __PUNCT__
my oppon campaign said that vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__ wa a strategi to provid polit cover __PUNCT__
the chicago tribun said the present vote were the equival of take a pass __PUNCT__
instead of look for polit cover or take a pass __PUNCT__ we need a presid who will take a stand and stand there and do whatev is necessari for their countri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ stand up for america valu and protect our countri and our peopl is the first job of the presid __PUNCT__
bring us togeth to end the war __PUNCT__ fix our economi __PUNCT__ and take on big challeng like immigr __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ energi independ __PUNCT__ climat chang and so much els is what i will do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ a presid can't dodg the big fight __PUNCT__ can't find polit cover __PUNCT__ or have word speak louder than action __PUNCT__
a lot of word we have these dai aren't match by action __PUNCT__
and much of the action i see __PUNCT__ i simpli disagre with __PUNCT__
