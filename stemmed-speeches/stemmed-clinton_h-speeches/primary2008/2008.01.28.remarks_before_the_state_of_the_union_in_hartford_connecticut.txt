it is the last time georg bush will give a state of the union __PUNCT__
if we all do our part __PUNCT__ next year it be a democrat presid give the state of the union __PUNCT__
let be clear __PUNCT__ on thing that presid bush ha never understood is that the state of the union is not about a speech in washington __PUNCT__
it is about the state of the live of the american peopl __PUNCT__
what is happen in our school __PUNCT__ in our hospit __PUNCT__ in our job __PUNCT__ it is whether or not we have peopl who feel that thei ar move toward the american dream or whether it look like it get further and further awai no matter how hard thei work __PUNCT__
it is about whether or not peopl will be abl to stai in their home or if thei will lose their home to foreclosur __PUNCT__ therebi realli undermin the american dream __PUNCT__
it is about whether we as a nation will restor our leadership and our moral author __PUNCT__ bring our constitut out of cold storag __PUNCT__ begin to act like american again __PUNCT__ solv our problem __PUNCT__ work toward a better futur __PUNCT__ make it possibl for us to be proud of our countri __PUNCT__
thi campaign that we ar wage is on of the most import in our nation histori becaus we ar at a turn point __PUNCT__
we know that we have so much work to do __PUNCT__ and it will take all of us __PUNCT__
it not just about those of us who ar run __PUNCT__
it about all of you and everyon els here in connecticut and across america who know that we can do better __PUNCT__
i believ with all my heart that america is readi for an elect that set a new agenda __PUNCT__ new prioriti __PUNCT__ that give us back that confid and optim that should be our birthright __PUNCT__
i believ that america can solv ani problem that we put our mind to __PUNCT__
i believ that we can onc again be a nation that set the pace __PUNCT__ that creat the innov and the futur await __PUNCT__
but i believ that we got to do that by make it veri clear what we stand for and what we won't stand for __PUNCT__
i think it imper that thi elect be about the real concern of the american peopl __PUNCT__
as nanci said __PUNCT__ some peopl think polit is a game __PUNCT__
it excit __PUNCT__ you can have ralli like thi __PUNCT__
we have so mani peopl outsid and we ar move them into an overflow room and that realli a great wai of demonstr involv and particip __PUNCT__
but at the end __PUNCT__ it about ar peopl better off when we stop than when we start __PUNCT__
doe some child who didn't have health care befor have it now __PUNCT__ doe some hard work man __PUNCT__ who ha given hi all to hi job and ha seen it move offshor __PUNCT__ feel like he ha ani hope left __PUNCT__ some work woman who get up at the crack of dawn and work as hard as she can __PUNCT__ ever get equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__ these ar the kind of concern and issu that i care about __PUNCT__
i have been in and out of the home and workplac and commun center of american across our countri __PUNCT__
and what thei want to talk to me about is the insecur thei feel __PUNCT__ the fear that thei ar confront __PUNCT__
i am sure that the presid tonight will __PUNCT__ as he ha for the previou seven year __PUNCT__ sai that the state of our union is strong __PUNCT__
but with all due respect mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ you not on the road with me __PUNCT__
come and meet the peopl that i meet __PUNCT__
listen to the stori i listen to __PUNCT__
sit at tabl in diner and hear what on america mind __PUNCT__
i have veri differ belief than the current administr __PUNCT__
i believ that everybodi in america who will to work hard for a live should bring home an incom abov the poverti line __PUNCT__
i think that should be part of what we hold out for peopl and make sure that thei have __PUNCT__
i believ health care is a moral right __PUNCT__ not a privileg for the few and the wealthi __PUNCT__
i believ peopl have the right to organ and bargain collect and have better wage and work condit __PUNCT__
i believ that our educ system is not just about our children take test but unlock their imagin and their potenti __PUNCT__
i believ our tax code should be fair to the middl class __PUNCT__
it the middl class that built america __PUNCT__
it the middl class that creat most of the wealth and the job in america __PUNCT__ and it time that we have a tax code that reflect that again __PUNCT__
i believ that an invest manag on wall street make fifti million dollar a year should not pai a lower percentag in tax than a teacher in hartford make fifti __PUNCT__ thousand dollar a year __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i believ that anyon who want to move a job from connecticut oversea should not get on penni of tax payer help to do it __PUNCT__
there should not be ani giveawai in our tax code to creat job somewher els than america __PUNCT__
i believ everi child deserv a chanc to make it in life __PUNCT__
that why we need a univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten program __PUNCT__ that why we need more help for famili __PUNCT__ so that thei can get their own children off to a good start __PUNCT__
i believ we have to start over from scratch with no child left behind and get back to have a partnership between our teacher and our student and the rest of us __PUNCT__
i believ that colleg should be afford for middl class and work famili again __PUNCT__
i believ we got to do more to help those who don't go to colleg __PUNCT__ the young men and women who build the build we work in __PUNCT__
thei deserv more job train and apprenticeship program for a better futur __PUNCT__
i believ that we got to restor the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__ we got to respect our civil right and our civil liberti __PUNCT__ we have to respect the right to privaci and we have to sai no loudli and clearli to those like presid bush and vice presid chenei who don't understand american histori or american valu __PUNCT__
i believ we can do better than what we seen the last seven year with the cronyism and the corrupt and the no __PUNCT__ bid contract and the indiffer and the incompet __PUNCT__
i believ we can actual start appoint qualifi peopl to the posit we ask them to hold in the govern again __PUNCT__
i believ we can restor american leadership and moral author in the world __PUNCT__ begin with end the war in iraq and bring our troop home within sixti dai of when i becom presid __PUNCT__
i believ that when a young man or woman sign up to serv our countri in the unit state militari __PUNCT__ we sign up to serv that young man or woman __PUNCT__
we ow them the health care __PUNCT__ the compens __PUNCT__ and the support and servic that thei have earn __PUNCT__
i believ that we ar strongest when we lead with our valu __PUNCT__
we have the greatest militari in the world __PUNCT__ there no doubt about that __PUNCT__ but militari forc should be us onli as a last resort __PUNCT__ not a first resort __PUNCT__
that is someth we have to make clear to the rest of the world again i believ we can work with other countri to find common ground __PUNCT__
i believ that the rest of the world is hold it breath __PUNCT__ wait for a new dai __PUNCT__
i believ that we can have a new energi polici that is focus on clean renew energi __PUNCT__ that put million of peopl in connecticut and across america to work in make and deliv that new energi __PUNCT__
i believ we can take on global warm and we can do it in a smart wai and the unit state can be a leader again in come up with a framework that includ china and india and other countri in help to save our planet and at the same time see the result in new job and new technolog and new export __PUNCT__
i believ we can have trade agreement that honor labor and environment standard and that ar enforc against countri that violat them __PUNCT__
i believ we can get back to fiscal respons where __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ the unit state is strong __PUNCT__
we not go into debt for the war in iraq and tax cut for the wealthiest of american but instead we ar take care of the need of our peopl at home __PUNCT__
if we move back toward fiscal respons we will regain our fiscal sovereignti __PUNCT__
right now we borrow monei from chines to bui oil from saudi __PUNCT__
that is not a good deal for america __PUNCT__ i believ we can do better than that __PUNCT__
i believ that the next elect is not just about who get elect __PUNCT__
i believ the next elect is about the next gener __PUNCT__
it about all of these young peopl who ar here todai __PUNCT__
it about your futur __PUNCT__ your potenti __PUNCT__ the countri and world you will inherit __PUNCT__
so how do we translat our belief into action __PUNCT__ how do we go from a campaign where we make speech __PUNCT__ where peopl stand up and cheer and clap loudli __PUNCT__ into make what we believ real __PUNCT__ i think it start by have an elect about what matter __PUNCT__ about what we can do togeth __PUNCT__
i have spent a year talk veri specif about my plan __PUNCT__ what i will do to creat more job and return to fiscal respons and growth __PUNCT__ and lift peopl out of poverti and give them a chanc to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
about how we will have health care by open up the congression plan that is there for member of congress and their staff and feder employe to everi singl america who want it and give tax credit for those who can't afford it on their own __PUNCT__
i know that we have to chang our educ program from the feder level and i know that we got to creat a better partnership between washington and connecticut and hartford and all of the other commun here __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
there is so much yearn in our countri to be part of someth bigger than ourselv again __PUNCT__
we can provid a realli posit view of our futur togeth and we can ask everybodi to be a part of it __PUNCT__
it not just about elect a presid and pass legisl through the congress __PUNCT__
it about what each and everi on of us will do __PUNCT__
if we have a new energi and global warm strategi in america then we all go to have to conserv more __PUNCT__ we go to have to be more energi effici and look for wai in our school and our busi __PUNCT__ and our commun to realli take on thi challeng __PUNCT__
i think we up to it __PUNCT__
there never been a challeng america hasn't met onc we made up our mind to do it __PUNCT__
i go to work veri hard to get us to univers health care __PUNCT__
it is long overdu in america and we ar go to make it possibl for peopl to get health care coverag for mental health __PUNCT__ which should no longer be left out and stigmat __PUNCT__ for prevent that will keep us healthi and well __PUNCT__
but then i go to ask all of us to do more to stai healthi and to help each other and young peopl will lead the wai to give us that encourag __PUNCT__ so that we can be as strong as possibl __PUNCT__
when it come to educ __PUNCT__ i want famili to invest more in their own children __PUNCT__
i done thi work __PUNCT__ as dick wa sai __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
a famili is a child first school __PUNCT__
parent ar child first teacher __PUNCT__
most parent realli want to know what to do __PUNCT__ but there not a lot of help out there __PUNCT__ is there __PUNCT__ we need to give more support to famili so that thei can be the best possibl teacher and parent __PUNCT__
we need to have work to be friendlier again __PUNCT__
i am so proud of chri dodd and what he did to make sure the famili and medic leav act wa pass after try for seven year with two presidenti veto __PUNCT__
we need to work to expand it so that more peopl don't have to make these realli tough choic between be a good employe and be a good famili member __PUNCT__
we got to reliev a lot of the pressur that so mani famili feel todai becaus we have care __PUNCT__ giver take care of chronic ill spous or parent or children __PUNCT__
thei do it for love __PUNCT__
thei do it becaus it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
if thei stop take care of each other tomorrow __PUNCT__ we have to find __MONEY__ billion a year to replac the care that is given out of love __PUNCT__
let start help famili be the best thei can be to take care on anoth __PUNCT__
if we ar seriou about famili valu __PUNCT__ let start valu famili and give everybodi the tool thei should have to make the most out of their famili live __PUNCT__

i will do everyth i can to make colleg afford with new tax credit for famili __PUNCT__ with more pell grant __PUNCT__ with higher level so that more peopl can take advantag of them __PUNCT__
i want to give two more year of nation servic to those who need to earn monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ up to __MONEY__ a year so that you can pai your wai if you graduat with debt __PUNCT__
if you ar will to do a public servic job like teach or nurs or firefight or law enforc __PUNCT__ we will forgiv your debt becaus of what you ar give back to our societi __PUNCT__
but the door of colleg ar not just open by sai __PUNCT__ just open __PUNCT__
thei ar open becaus peopl work hard for it __PUNCT__
we ar in a competit in america __PUNCT__

each of our young peopl have to be pois and readi to plai a part in thi global competit __PUNCT__

around the world __PUNCT__ we need to have a bipartisan foreign polici again __PUNCT__ a lot of the problem we face ar not republican or democrat problem __PUNCT__
we have to repair all the relationship that have been damag by presid bush __PUNCT__ on veri contin across the globe __PUNCT__
that why it is so import to start withdraw our troop from iraq __PUNCT__
i have said __PUNCT__ as soon as i could __PUNCT__ upon take offic if i am so fortun to do that __PUNCT__ i would ask the secretari of defens and the joint chief of staff and the secur advisor to give me a plan to begin __PUNCT__
