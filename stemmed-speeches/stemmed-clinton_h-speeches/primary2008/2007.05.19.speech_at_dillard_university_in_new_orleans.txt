and when the spring semest came __PUNCT__ becaus of her persever __PUNCT__ dillard univers had a new home __PUNCT__ in a hilton hotel __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ presid hugh and the faculti and the truste and the stuff did not know whether you would come back __PUNCT__
whether you would be will to pursu your studi in a temporari campu in a struggl citi __PUNCT__
she thought mayb __NUM__ or __NUM__ of you would return __PUNCT__
but by the time those door open in __DATE__ of __NUM__ of you were readi to walk through __PUNCT__
you came back __PUNCT__
you came becaus you refus to abandon thi great american univers and thi great american citi __PUNCT__
you came back becaus you refus to leav behind the friend __PUNCT__ the professor __PUNCT__ and so mani who had becom your extend famili __PUNCT__
you came back becaus you knew that dillard is more than the beauti build and the lush green lawn and the majest oak __PUNCT__ you knew that what make dillard special is someth no storm __PUNCT__ no flood __PUNCT__ or fire can ever destroi __PUNCT__
and becaus you came back __PUNCT__ dillard univers came back as well __PUNCT__
you did your job __PUNCT__ you learn you taught you devot long hour to serv your commun __PUNCT__
peopl and institut in new orlean __PUNCT__ and across america __PUNCT__ thei did their job too __PUNCT__
the non __PUNCT__ profit provid desper __PUNCT__ need servic in terribl condit __PUNCT__
the church reach out to those most in need __PUNCT__
ordinari citizen volunt donat monei open up their home and heart __PUNCT__
but unfortun __PUNCT__ the feder govern did not do it job __PUNCT__
it didn't hold up it end of the bargain __PUNCT__
now feder offici did find time to track down student and demand recoup of monei thei gave you to surviv the storm __PUNCT__ but in everyth els from emerg respons to rebuild public work to restor essenti servic __PUNCT__ the feder govern fail __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ nearli two year later __PUNCT__ we still don't have a reliabl hurrican protect system __PUNCT__
we still haven't rebuilt school __PUNCT__ hospit __PUNCT__ firehous or park __PUNCT__
there ar more than __NUM__ household live in trailer __PUNCT__
and new orlean is caught in a viciou cycl __PUNCT__
becaus so mani peopl have left __PUNCT__ neighborhood haven't recov __PUNCT__
and becaus neighborhood haven't recov __PUNCT__ mani peopl simpli cannot come back __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ a natur disast becam a nation disgrac __PUNCT__ and an intern embarrass __PUNCT__
let me sai that again __PUNCT__ thi is a nation disgrac __PUNCT__
anyon who think thi is a local or region crisi __PUNCT__ anyon who think thi is about __PUNCT__ them __PUNCT__ and not __PUNCT__ us __PUNCT__ is sore mistaken __PUNCT__
think about how all american benefit from the commerc that goe through thi citi port __PUNCT__
how all of us benefit from the oil and ga produc off your shore __PUNCT__
all of us have been enrich by the cultur and legaci of thi citi __PUNCT__
and when our fellow citizen hurt __PUNCT__ all of us hurt __PUNCT__
whether in oklahoma citi or new york citi or new orlean __PUNCT__ when american our fellow citizen suffer __PUNCT__ all of us suffer __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i want to be veri clear __PUNCT__ rebuild thi citi is not a new orlean oblig or a louisiana oblig __PUNCT__ it is an american oblig __PUNCT__
and i want to spend a few minut with you todai talk about that oblig __PUNCT__
and how we final begin to fulfil it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as a senat from new york after __DATE__ i know what it like to stand in the aftermath of destruct so great __PUNCT__ you can bare comprehend it __PUNCT__ and to wonder where to even begin and whether you ever fulli recov __PUNCT__
but i also know about the kind of love for a citi that make you determin to not just restor what you lost __PUNCT__ but to creat someth stronger __PUNCT__ more beauti __PUNCT__ and more last __PUNCT__
i also know a thing or two about what you don't need as you try to move forward __PUNCT__
you don't need more empti promis __PUNCT__
you don't need more talk __PUNCT__
you don't need more bureaucraci __PUNCT__
if talk and bureaucraci and promis were enough __PUNCT__ we have rebuilt new orlean three time over by now __PUNCT__
what we do need is action __PUNCT__
action support by our feder govern __PUNCT__ but driven right here in new orlean and in the surround parish __PUNCT__
by the peopl who understand the realiti on the ground __PUNCT__
action that lead to real __PUNCT__ measur improv __PUNCT__
not six month from now __PUNCT__ or a year from now __PUNCT__ but right now __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ where do we begin __PUNCT__ how do we stop talk the talk and start walk the walk __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we need a comprehens approach __PUNCT__ on where the feder govern respond to what our state and local leader and resid ar tell them from the point of live and work in the area __PUNCT__
i want to commend group like women of the storm __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ i fulli support their propos to hold a debat right here in new orlean in the fall of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
my good friend and colleagu __PUNCT__ mari landrieu __PUNCT__ ha been a passion voic and an effect leader for louisiana __PUNCT__ and i have learn a great deal from her dure thi time __PUNCT__
i support her coastal restor plan __PUNCT__
my propos in thi area build on her work __PUNCT__ and the work of other leader from thi state and region __PUNCT__
my approach start with put on person __PUNCT__ on account person in charg of recoveri effort and give that person the author he or she need to do that job __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the feder govern gulf coast rebuild offic is buri in bureaucraci at the depart of homeland secur __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ there should be a feder recoveri director who sit in the west wing and report directli to the presid everi singl week about what is happen to the peopl who ar still suffer __PUNCT__
and the director first order of busi should be to reach out to everi commun affect and figur out exactli what thei need and how the feder govern can help __PUNCT__
i don't think that commun should have to go to the feder govern to beg for help __PUNCT__ the feder govern should come to them __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ let get feder monei where it need right now __PUNCT__
enough with the red tape __PUNCT__
enough with the paperwork __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ commun ar requir to match a percentag of the fund thei receiv from fema __PUNCT__
but we know that mani simpli can't afford it __PUNCT__
when you hear peopl in washington talk about all the monei that been appropri for louisiana __PUNCT__ stop and ask yourself how much of that monei ha actual been deliv to the peopl of louisiana __PUNCT__
so let do for new orlean and the surround parish what wa done for new york after 9/11 __PUNCT__
waiv the rule requir match fund to get feder monei for infrastructur improv __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ let creat a user __PUNCT__ friendli __PUNCT__ flexibl __PUNCT__ streamlin process to get fund for public work project __PUNCT__
here on of the thing that drive peopl crazi __PUNCT__ thei try to get flood monei through a program call a program call commun develop block grant to servic the mass to get the monei from fema __PUNCT__ you have to get the environment assess __PUNCT__
try to get the monei from fema __PUNCT__ you need to have an environment assess __PUNCT__
don't you think thei could talk togeth and on singl environment assess __PUNCT__ instead of requir peopl to spend __NUM__ and __NUM__ thousand dollar to get two assess __PUNCT__ thi is the kind bureaucrat nonsens that ha stood in the wai of rebuild __PUNCT__
and onc a commun ha appli for fund __PUNCT__ let provid a small amount of monei upfront __PUNCT__ so you can get start on their project while thei wait for approv __PUNCT__
and let come togeth and final find a wai to make the __PUNCT__ road home __PUNCT__ program actual work for the peopl of louisiana __PUNCT__
i wa in the broadmoor neighborhood yesterdai __PUNCT__ i met with mr __PUNCT__ johnson __PUNCT__ a widow __PUNCT__ rais six children in her home __PUNCT__
unfortun she paid fifti thousand dollar to a contractor who turn out to be unscrupul __PUNCT__
and the work done on her home doe not meet the standard of the citi __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ she is still live in on of the trailer __PUNCT__
how mani of you have been in on of the fema trailer __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ you know how difficult it is __PUNCT__
and across the street __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ washington is paralyz on on side __PUNCT__ a retir gentleman try to save hi home __PUNCT__
wonder when he is go to get the help to do the work that he need to do __PUNCT__
it is heartbreak to see peopl who ar decent hardwork american neglect by their govern __PUNCT__
on of the thing we need is more peopl to help __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ let creat a gulf coast corp of dedic men and women who would work fulltim to help our commun rebuild __PUNCT__
congressmen benni thompson of mississippi and other member of the congression black caucu ar work on a similar idea __PUNCT__
i would envis the corp have two separ part __PUNCT__ on that would provid financi incent to skill profession __PUNCT__ teacher __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ nurs and other to serv high __PUNCT__ need area __PUNCT__
the other work hand __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hand with the build trade union would consist of worker and apprentic who would complet prioriti project __PUNCT__
mani would be local __PUNCT__ and mani would be abl to return to get job that paid well __PUNCT__
and you could work with local commun to help restor our fire station __PUNCT__ the hospit __PUNCT__ sewer and so much els __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ let make sure we final build a reliabl hurrican protect system for the citi of new orlean __PUNCT__
that start with a stem __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ stern review of the armi corp of engin __PUNCT__ plan and progress so far in build the leve and pump system __PUNCT__
onc we certain we on the right track __PUNCT__ let fulli fund the construct of thi system __PUNCT__ and let set a deadlin so we actual get it done __PUNCT__
we also need the corp initi a wetland restor plan __PUNCT__ becaus we if we don't build up the wetland we know we won't be abl to protect the citi __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ let expand afford hous __PUNCT__
we know we need to provid more hous __PUNCT__
the presid show me the hous she alreadi built here on campu __PUNCT__ it look a lot better than trailer __PUNCT__
we also need to address the skyrocket cost of insur and provid more rental hous __PUNCT__
next __PUNCT__ let deal with the rise crime rate __PUNCT__ put more polic back on the street __PUNCT__ fund them with feder dollar __PUNCT__
we need to make sure we have __NUM__ centuri school for new orlean __PUNCT__
we know there were seriou problem befor katrina __PUNCT__ and let set the goal of make new orlean school the best in the countri __PUNCT__
eighth __PUNCT__ let revit the health care system in thi citi __PUNCT__
reopen hospit __PUNCT__ and let rebuild chariti hospit __PUNCT__ and make it simpl for healthcar patient __PUNCT__
we need to address the grow mental health crisi in the citi and the area __PUNCT__
let promot smart develop __PUNCT__ clean effici energi us __PUNCT__ green __PUNCT__ build and so much els __PUNCT__ so new orlean is sustain __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we have to overhaul our nation disast respons system __PUNCT__
let start by make fema independ again __PUNCT__ give it cabinet __PUNCT__ level posit __PUNCT__ where it report directli to the __URL__ creat a katrina and rita commiss model on the 9/11 commiss to figur out what went wrong so it will never happen again __PUNCT__
when all is said and done __PUNCT__ i know how hard it is to move forward after a tragedi of thi magnitud __PUNCT__
in a tribut read at a remembr servic for british citizen lost on __DATE__ queen elizabeth wrote that __PUNCT__ grief is the price we pai for love __PUNCT__
i know that todai __PUNCT__ mani still griev for those we love and lost __PUNCT__
