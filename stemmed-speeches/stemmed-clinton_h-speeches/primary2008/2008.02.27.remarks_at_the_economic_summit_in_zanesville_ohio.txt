we join by distinguish guest from across the state as well as the countri __PUNCT__ elect offici __PUNCT__ leader from labor and busi and educ __PUNCT__ and some hard __PUNCT__ work ohioan who you hear from __PUNCT__
now we mai have come from differ background but we all here with the same purpos __PUNCT__
and that is __PUNCT__ when it come to our economi __PUNCT__ we know we can do a lot better __PUNCT__
i have been across ohio and across america for more than a year __PUNCT__ actual go back about __NUM__ year when i wa first privileg to travel extens in our countri __PUNCT__
thi ha been a great opportun for me to hear firsthand from the peopl who ar worri about their job becaus thei alreadi seen those job be ship over sea __PUNCT__
thei worri about lose health care __PUNCT__ becaus thei alreadi seen that health care lost __PUNCT__
thei worri about afford colleg becaus thei alreadi seen too mani young peopl from too mani hard work famili who ar have a hard time afford the rise cost __PUNCT__
thei alreadi seen energi price go up so fast over the last __NUM__ year that the averag famili is pai more then __MONEY__ in energi todai then thei were in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so peopl ar live with the realiti __PUNCT__ and thei meet them with the grit and determin that we would expect from ohioan and american __PUNCT__
but it time that we had a presid who is go to be a fighter and a champion for the american peopl again __PUNCT__ who would get up everydai __PUNCT__ who would get up everydai and would sai what ar we go to do togeth __PUNCT__ to the white hous staff and the cabinet and the govern and the busi and labor leader in our countri __PUNCT__ what ar we go to todai to improv the live of young hard work american __PUNCT__ what ar we go to do to rebuild a strong and prosper middl class __PUNCT__ that is my mission __PUNCT__
that is what i would do as your presid __PUNCT__
i see a middl class comeback and i see it start in place like zanesvil __PUNCT__
it won't happen though just by hope for it __PUNCT__ it will onli happen if we ar determin and we have a plan and we implement it __PUNCT__ and we see the result __PUNCT__
and that what i intend to do __PUNCT__
i put forth my econom blueprint for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ it includ a lot of the specif that i been travel around ohio talk about __PUNCT__
we go to rein in the corpor special interest __PUNCT__ we can take back __MONEY__ billion in tax giveawai that the republican and georg bush have hand out to the oil compani __PUNCT__ to the drug compani __PUNCT__ to the health insur compani __PUNCT__
we go to sai __PUNCT__ wait a minut wall street __PUNCT__ you had your presid __PUNCT__
now we need a presid for main street __PUNCT__
and we go to make that happen __PUNCT__
we go to start invest in manufactur again __PUNCT__
i believ you can't have a strong economi unless you have a strong manufactur sector __PUNCT__
we can't reli on other countri to produc what the american militari need __PUNCT__
so it not onli a question for our economi __PUNCT__ it a question for our nation secur __PUNCT__
i believ we could creat at least five million green collar job with clean renew energi that would put ohioan to work start soon __PUNCT__
i also know that if we invest in our infrastructur __PUNCT__ more bridg __PUNCT__ tunnel __PUNCT__ road __PUNCT__ water system __PUNCT__ sanit system __PUNCT__ we would put a lot of peopl to work and we would upgrad our infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
in order to do that __PUNCT__ we go to close everi tax loophol that still give on penni of your tax dollar to ani compani that export a job __PUNCT__
instead we go to put that monei to work here __PUNCT__
we go to address the home foreclosur and mortgag crisi __PUNCT__ you hear a littl bit about that todai __PUNCT__
too mani ohioan ar lose their home __PUNCT__ the number ar stagger __PUNCT__ __NUM__ home and foreclosur last year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ notic went out in __DATE__ alon __PUNCT__
these ar a lot of hard work peopl who thought thei were go to right thing __PUNCT__
i said we should have a moratorium on home foreclosur __PUNCT__
let figur out as wai to work out keep peopl in their home __PUNCT__ instead of have vacant hous in neighborhood that will decreas properti valu for everybodi __PUNCT__
i believ we need univers health care __PUNCT__ no except __PUNCT__ no excus __PUNCT__ and i know we can achiev that __PUNCT__
we do need afford colleg again __PUNCT__ someth that is on of my highest prioriti __PUNCT__
it is now more expens for a young person to go to colleg in america than it wa thirti and forti year ago __PUNCT__ that wrong __PUNCT__
through a combin of tax credit and aid __PUNCT__ rein in the student loan compani that have been act like predatori lender __PUNCT__ we go to go back to direct lend to help student afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__
and if thei come out with debt __PUNCT__ if thei ar will to do a public servic job like teach or nurs or law enforc __PUNCT__ we will forgiv their debt so that thei can be debt free __PUNCT__
we go to start support our union again __PUNCT__ becaus when union were strong we had a strong middl class __PUNCT__
it not an accid __PUNCT__
it time that work peopl had a presid on their side again __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we ar go to have trade that lift up our famili __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ worker __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ environ __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ american trade __PUNCT__
that go to be on of my highest prioriti __PUNCT__
i know that nafta ha hurt a lot of ohio famili __PUNCT__
that why i have taken action __PUNCT__ i the onli candid with a comprehens plan to fix nafta __PUNCT__
and i will also crack down on china unfair trade practic __PUNCT__ includ currenc manipul which give them big advantag over our compani and our countri __PUNCT__
we not just here to talk about what i want to do __PUNCT__ i want to hear what peopl have to sai about what we can do togeth __PUNCT__
we have an extraordinari group of peopl __PUNCT__ and i want to hear about the challeng that thei face __PUNCT__
i go to ask each person to introduc him or herself becaus i want your advic __PUNCT__
i will be a presid __PUNCT__ just as i have been a senat __PUNCT__ who listen __PUNCT__
i think you learn more when you listen than when you ar talk __PUNCT__
and what is necessari for zanesvil mai not be the same as toledo __PUNCT__ mai not be the same as san antonio __PUNCT__ mai not be the same as chicago or new york __PUNCT__
so we need to look close at what will work in commun across ohio and america __PUNCT__
i think that we got some great opportun here __PUNCT__
we hear a lot about the problem and thei ar seriou but i believ for everi problem __PUNCT__ there is at least on solut __PUNCT__
we just have to start act like american again and roll up our sleev and actual solv our problem __PUNCT__
no more whine __PUNCT__ no more finger point __PUNCT__ let get to work __PUNCT__
i like to start our discuss todai by hear from the ohioan who have gracious taken their time out to join us __PUNCT__
i want to start with dave cimperman __PUNCT__
dave and i met at grace grill in parma last week __PUNCT__
david ha work at gener motor for more than forti year __PUNCT__ and he see the economi from the front line of the work forc __PUNCT__
i want to ask dave if you can share with us what you see as the kei econom challeng face you and your famili __PUNCT__
dave cimperman __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ on of the big thing that i see is the univers health care __PUNCT__
gener motor is pai each __PUNCT__ is charg __MONEY__ per vehicl becaus of the health care that thei give us __PUNCT__
thei compet with automobil compani in japan __PUNCT__
it time we got on __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ obvious i agre with dave and i realli happi he mention thi becaus there ar two veri import reason that we should have univers health care __PUNCT__
the first is that it is the moral right thing to do __PUNCT__
i do not believ peopl in our countri should be deni access to qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care __PUNCT__
and the second reason is there is no doubt in my mind __PUNCT__ as dave just said __PUNCT__ we have lost job over the last __NUM__ year and increasingli over the last seven year where we lost __PUNCT__ in ohio alon __PUNCT__ __NUM__ job in manufactur while georg bush ha been presid __PUNCT__
and on of the main reason is health care cost __PUNCT__
becaus as dave said __PUNCT__ gener motor ha to put __MONEY__ of it monei into ever car __PUNCT__ imagin what a competit disadvantag that is __PUNCT__
other countri don't impos that burden on their compani __PUNCT__ and particularli on their manufactur __PUNCT__
so it econom necessari for us to achiev univers health care __PUNCT__
dave __PUNCT__ you been work for gener motor for quit some time __PUNCT__ ar there other issu in addit to univers health care that we have to address __PUNCT__ dave cimperman __PUNCT__ we would like to see a more even trade polici __PUNCT__
there ar a number of them that we ar allow limit number of vehicl to countri and we take up a lot more come into thi countri __PUNCT__
i must mention __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ that the same forti year i work for gener motor __PUNCT__ i wa also a unit auto worker __PUNCT__ in the union __PUNCT__ i still in the union __PUNCT__
i give you my opinion __PUNCT__ not the union opinion __PUNCT__

we vote __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that the onli thing you can do is vote for chang and we vote for governor strickland __PUNCT__
i almost feel like it work __PUNCT__ my on vote work becaus i sit right next to him __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ beth __PUNCT__ do you want to add anyth to what robert said __PUNCT__ beth dlabai __PUNCT__ it wa just realli difficult becaus __PUNCT__ in the meantim our granddaught that wa live with us had to undergo open heart surgeri and the lender attornei did not want to wait on us to sign the paper __PUNCT__ thei just want us to sign the paper and get out __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we had to travel from dayton to cincinnati and find somebodi els to take care of our other two grandchildren becaus she had to have a pulmonari valv put in __PUNCT__
thei didn't care __PUNCT__
if it hadn't been for the miami vallei fair hous center i realli don't know what we would have done __PUNCT__
and there too mani peopl __PUNCT__ thei can't even help them __PUNCT__
there a lot more peopl __PUNCT__
we got out of it __PUNCT__ we fine __PUNCT__ our granddaught fine __PUNCT__ we go to make it __PUNCT__
we found anoth hous to live in __PUNCT__ we got the kid christma __PUNCT__ we made sure we had a tree up christma ev even though we had to be out __PUNCT__
i got everyth readi for them and when we went and got them __PUNCT__ thei had christma __PUNCT__
that the import thing __PUNCT__ i just wish that miami vallei fair hous center could help more peopl like us but thei need the fund __PUNCT__ thei don't get it __PUNCT__
i don't want ani other famili to have to go what we went through __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ when i first met robert and beth in dayton thei had on of their grandson with them and it wa so impress to me the wai robert explain how he alwai paid hi bill __PUNCT__ he wa rais in a famili where you suppos to pai your bill __PUNCT__
he sent in the check __PUNCT__ and thi is on of the mani scam that these lender get awai with __PUNCT__ where thei claim you late __PUNCT__
you can show when you sent it __PUNCT__ and thei sai well we didn't receiv it __PUNCT__
and you of cours can't control when thei claim thei receiv it __PUNCT__
then thei us those late payment to forc a higher interest rate on you __PUNCT__
forc you into refinanc __PUNCT__
it just a terribl abus that doe need to be crack down on __PUNCT__
and robert is right __PUNCT__ the fine is so small it worth a lot of these compani just gambl __PUNCT__
so i think there need to be crimin consequ and much tougher fine to rein in these lender __PUNCT__
as beth said __PUNCT__ we need more help to the organ that ar try to save peopl home and i have a propos where we would put monei into do just that __PUNCT__ help commun that ar face a high foreclosur rate __PUNCT__
as the governor know so well __PUNCT__ ohio ha on of the highest foreclosur rate in the countri __PUNCT__ i think it like number nine in the whole countri __PUNCT__
thi is a big issu that affect so mani famili here __PUNCT__
we so lucki to have governor strickland with us becaus he been work hard to turn around ohio __PUNCT__ and he ha lot of great idea about how he go to improv the econom live of peopl across the state __PUNCT__
so governor __PUNCT__ i like to ask you to tell us what you think ar the three most press econom challeng that you face as the governor of ohio __PUNCT__
governor ted strickland __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ we have huge budget challeng __PUNCT__
we pass a budget not mani month ago unanim __PUNCT__
everi republican and everi democrat in the senat vote for it and all but on member of the hous of repres vote for it __PUNCT__ although both chamber ar control by the republican parti __PUNCT__ we were abl to work togeth to fashion a budget that identifi prioriti for ohio __PUNCT__
we want a budget that would provid health care coverag for all of our children __PUNCT__ we want a budget that would freez colleg tuition after ten straight year of annual increas in tuition of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ everi year for ten year __PUNCT__ make ohio __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more costli for our young peopl to go to an ohio public colleg or univers than wa the nation averag __PUNCT__
we did some realli good thing in a veri bipartisan wai __PUNCT__
but the economi had a downturn __PUNCT__
the nation economi is affect what happen here in ohio __PUNCT__
and so i been face __PUNCT__ just within the last few week __PUNCT__ of have to make some veri pain decis becaus we had to cut over __MONEY__ million out of the budget __PUNCT__
these decis affect real peopl __PUNCT__ real famili and real children __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ if i were to give you the three thing that i think could be most help to ohio and __PUNCT__ quit frankli __PUNCT__ these ar the reason that i support you __PUNCT__
i known you for __NUM__ year but i wouldn't support you if i didn't think you were the best candid for ohio __PUNCT__
in ohio __PUNCT__ as is the case in mani other state __PUNCT__ __NUM__ state ar now have to go back and revisit their budget __PUNCT__
__NUM__ state and that number is grow __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we have huge rise medicaid expenditur in ohio __PUNCT__
so if we had a heath care system that could provid health care coverag to everyon in a plan __PUNCT__ fu __PUNCT__ ration wai __PUNCT__ it would make such a huge differ __PUNCT__
i sai to peopl __PUNCT__ can you imagin what life would be like if all of us had access to afford health care __PUNCT__ can we imagin the burden that would be taken off the shoulder of mom and dad know that their love on had access to health care coverag __PUNCT__ what it would do to our busi in term of make them more competit if thei didn't have thi burden __PUNCT__ so senat __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ and i go to sound veri polit here but i go to do it becaus i think it absolut true __PUNCT__ i think you ar the onli candid that can help us realiz a democrat dream __PUNCT__ an american dream __PUNCT__ sinc the dai of harri truman we tri to get univers health care coverag for the american peopl and we been unabl to __PUNCT__
we ar final at a place where that can happen __PUNCT__
the physician __PUNCT__ the health care provid now know it necessari __PUNCT__
the busi leader in our state now know it necessari __PUNCT__
i think thing ar come togeth __PUNCT__
what we need right now is a presid that is commit to get it done __PUNCT__
i am convinc that the on thing that could be help to all ohioan and to our overal economi is what you will do as presid __PUNCT__ that bring univers health care coverag to our peopl __PUNCT__
the second thing we need __PUNCT__ and i be quick __PUNCT__ we need job __PUNCT__
we need job __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__
and i propos a __MONEY__ billion bond packag that will creat job in ohio but i know that you work on that at the feder level __PUNCT__
you understand that we got to start invest in america __PUNCT__
we got to start build the infrastructur that is necessari to repair our road and bridg and sewer system and water system to help local commun build our countri __PUNCT__
that will creat job and so that the second thing __PUNCT__
and the third thing is certainli educ becaus educ is the ultim hope for our peopl and make sure we have a good __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ qualiti educ experi for our children from their youngest year through even graduat work and the adult worker up to the time of retir __PUNCT__
these ar the three thing that i think ohio need __PUNCT__
i think thei the thing that you as presid will accomplish __PUNCT__
if we can get that done __PUNCT__ you becom presid and you do those three thing for ohio __PUNCT__ we go to sai you were a pretti good presid __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you will have a partner in the white hous to realli tackl all of these challeng becaus thei so import __PUNCT__
and you given us a lot to think about __PUNCT__
on of the issu that i like to get into becaus it relat to what governor strickland said is both an econom opportun and a wai of give peopl a real shot at the american dream __PUNCT__ that hous __PUNCT__
what ar we go to do to provid more hous that afford __PUNCT__ and what ar we go to do to deal with thi home foreclosur crisi __PUNCT__ someon whom i admir so much is current governor of new jersei __PUNCT__ jon corzin __PUNCT__ who with us __PUNCT__
he is also a former unit state senat with whom i serv __PUNCT__
and he wa befor that the chief execut offic of on of the largest __PUNCT__ most success financi firm in the world __PUNCT__ goldman sach __PUNCT__
so he had a lot of experi in both the public and the privat sector __PUNCT__
so governor corzin __PUNCT__ two question __PUNCT__ specif with respect to the hous crisi __PUNCT__ how would you have approach a financi challeng like thi when you were in the privat sector __PUNCT__ and what step do you think we should take both at the state and the feder level __PUNCT__ and then in addit __PUNCT__ same question to you that i ask governor strickland __PUNCT__ the three big challeng that you cope with as governor __PUNCT__ governor corzin __PUNCT__
governor jon corzin __PUNCT__ thank you senat clinton and it great to be here in ohio and be with the great senat glenn __PUNCT__ governor strickland and all the citizen __PUNCT__
i have to sai __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ the stori that i heard alreadi from the peopl here and the problem that governor strickland outlin sound like i back home in new jersei __PUNCT__
we have peopl that struggl everi dai to make end meet on health care issu __PUNCT__ on hous issu __PUNCT__ thei worri about their job __PUNCT__
we actual just close right now the last gener motor auto product plant in our state __PUNCT__
we had five auto product plant __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
we ar go to have no auto product at all __PUNCT__
so these ar real issu __PUNCT__
the hous crisi that we have in the countri __PUNCT__ foreclosur __PUNCT__ predatori lend __PUNCT__ fact that peopl got into __PUNCT__ home ownership under fals pretens by peopl who sold them more than thei could actual carri ar thing that you were talk about when i wa a unit state senat __PUNCT__

and i know the governor and i want more than anyth els a partner in the white hous who not onli will come up with the solut but understand the problem becaus she ha actual dealt with them in her capac not just as an elect offici but as a privat individu __PUNCT__
citi like zanesvil and cleveland and toledo ar not new to you becaus you been travel to our citi for __NUM__ year and i can tell you that i believ that our greatest strength in our state is the fact that we __PUNCT__ under governor strickland leadership __PUNCT__ ar marri our proud past with an even more dynam futur __PUNCT__
let me explain what i mean __PUNCT__
ohio is known for mani thing but i would sai more than anyth it is known for three thing __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ that we ar the seed __PUNCT__ bed of invent __PUNCT__ entrepreneurship __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ and explor __PUNCT__
the best exampl of explor be none other than u. __PUNCT__ senat john glenn __PUNCT__
and i think you know that these dai that we measur the strength of our economi not just by the height of our smoke stack or the strength of our back but also by the depth of our innov and the strength of our idea __PUNCT__ which is why what we ar do is take advantag of our strong manufactur base __PUNCT__
we ar the third largest manufactur state in our countri __PUNCT__
and why we ar take advantag of our agricultur base __PUNCT__ as the largest econom forc in our state __PUNCT__ and actual convert that into the futur __PUNCT__
exampl __PUNCT__ we go from bicycl __PUNCT__ to bio fuel __PUNCT__
we go from glider to turbin engin and lunar rocket __PUNCT__
we go from cellulos and cord and soi bean to ethanol and other biofuel __PUNCT__
we go from a manufactur base to wind turbin __PUNCT__
just thi afternoon i spoke to a ceo of a compani call minster machin where governor strickland recent visit __PUNCT__
thi is a compani that began as a blacksmith shop __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
thei ar known as a strong but small manufactur compani __PUNCT__
the ceo __PUNCT__ a year ago __PUNCT__ after governor strickland wa elect __PUNCT__ and i think primarili becaus governor strickland wa elect __PUNCT__ decid to look into do someth new __PUNCT__
thei have start a divis of minster machin call minster wind __PUNCT__
and thei ar right now __PUNCT__ with our help and with the help of other partner __PUNCT__ creat a wind divis and take advantag of the fact that ohio ha got thi suppli chain of manufactur that can make the gearbox and all the bear and all the compon of windmil __PUNCT__
but thei want to do more __PUNCT__
thei actual want to make the windmil itself __PUNCT__
thei don't just want to be the compon part __PUNCT__
todai we have over __NUM__ manufactur compani that ar help suppli wind power around the world __PUNCT__
and i believ that under governor strickland leadership and the __MONEY__ billion job plan that he recent announc __PUNCT__ we will end up set asid __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ more fund in our state __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ than ani other state in the countri __PUNCT__ perhap even more than new jersei and new york __PUNCT__
for altern advanc energi __PUNCT__ we alreadi set asid __MONEY__ billion in low interest loan to privat compani want to get into the wind busi __PUNCT__
and if the governor plan pass thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and i hope with all of your support we have not onli a new presid of the unit state by the name of hillari clinton __PUNCT__ but that we also have a new job plan that will set asid __PUNCT__ but that we also have a job plan in __DATE__ that will set asid __MONEY__ million abov and beyond what we alreadi set asid for bring ohio into the __NUM__ centuri and move ohio to the head of the class __PUNCT__

so thank you so much __PUNCT__
now we go to turn to lieuten governor david patterson from new york __PUNCT__
david is a great friend of mine __PUNCT__
he is an extraordinari public servant and leader __PUNCT__
he ha been work veri hard on a lot of the same issu that affect ohio in upstat new york __PUNCT__
i often sai that upstat new york ha a lot of similar to ohio __PUNCT__ our citi __PUNCT__ our small town __PUNCT__ our countrysid __PUNCT__ our farmland __PUNCT__
and i been work veri hard to creat more job in upstat new york and david ha as well __PUNCT__ work with governor spitzer __PUNCT__
david i like you to perhap describ what you do and mayb some of he posit chang and success that you see __PUNCT__
lieuten governor david patterson __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i wa think of exactli what you sai when i wa read in the columbu dispatch thi morn about a compani that go to pai worker __MONEY__ an hour and creat __NUM__ job in lancast __PUNCT__ ohio in fairfield counti __PUNCT__
and thei ar go to begin that immedi __PUNCT__
and we find in new york thi same issu as in ohio __PUNCT__
ohio lost over on quarter of it manufactur job __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ worker out of work sinc the year __NUM__ __PUNCT__
new york ha lost __NUM__ manufactur job go back to the same time period __PUNCT__
what governor spitzer is do is the same thing __PUNCT__ get compani to come into the state __PUNCT__ go around __PUNCT__
you get well the same wai you got sick __PUNCT__ a littl at a time __PUNCT__ try to build back the workforc in upstat new york which is a region struggl for surviv __PUNCT__
it economi is such that almost __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our colleg graduat move out of new york to greater opportun __PUNCT__
but i think __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ what you have talk about __PUNCT__ can i call you madam presid __PUNCT__ senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ not yet __PUNCT__ david __PUNCT__
not yet __PUNCT__
lieuten governor david patterson __PUNCT__ i sorri __PUNCT__ i just practic __PUNCT__
i just think that your idea __PUNCT__ just like what governor strickland is do here in ohio with the research and technolog corridor on rout __NUM__ in columbu __PUNCT__ try to take our educ institut like ohio state and then us that to creat new job __PUNCT__
we do it in new york as well __PUNCT__
we do it with medic and scientif research __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha shut the door on medic and scientif research but also with green collar job __PUNCT__
what you were talk about __PUNCT__ that germani is the world leader in solar power __PUNCT__ thei have no more sunlight than the unit state __PUNCT__
the greatest amount of wind power job in thi countri were creat last year __PUNCT__
thei actual creat as mani job in the succeed four year __PUNCT__
i think senat __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ whatev we can do to help you when you get to the white hous is just the fact that the state ar almost fight among themselv and the job oversea __PUNCT__
we need you to bring american job back to our shore and we need america to prosper in the wai that can from the new technolog __PUNCT__ what would be the new discoveri that can help us __PUNCT__
in our state __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ we had __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the countri popul and we did about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the countri econom develop __PUNCT__
we built the eri lackawanna railroad and we built the eri canal __PUNCT__
in those __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ new york state went to do almost half of the econom develop in the countri and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the peopl live there __PUNCT__
the peopl move where the job were __PUNCT__
now thei ar move awai and we ar struggl more than other state __PUNCT__
state like ohio and new jersei with governor corzin and all the other state have great idea __PUNCT__ we just need that extra help from washington and we will succe __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ thank you so much __PUNCT__ david __PUNCT__
i think the two exampl david gave of the eri lackawanna railroad and the eri canal ar realli import becaus you heard governor strickland talk about the bond that he is go to bring to you as voter __PUNCT__
when the governor of new york __PUNCT__ back in the begin of the __NUM__ centuri said that he want to build a canal from new york citi to buffalo __PUNCT__ peopl thought he wa crazi __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ hi name wa clinton and thei call it __PUNCT__ clinton ditch __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ clinton folli __PUNCT__ and all kind of derogatori term __PUNCT__
but he wa a visionari and he said we can't just keep do what we ar do __PUNCT__ it not work __PUNCT__
we have to make big invest to make big chang __PUNCT__
that what abraham lincoln did with the intercontinent railroad in the middl of the civil war __PUNCT__
it what he did when he said we go to have land grant colleg __PUNCT__
we didn't even know we were go to keep the union togeth but he wa look at the futur __PUNCT__
it is what franklin roosevelt did with hi work program and what dwight eisenhow did with the interst highwai system and presid kennedi with the space program __PUNCT__
you could look and see how at critic moment in our histori __PUNCT__ our leader made bet on the futur and it time for us to do that again and there ar alwai naysay and peopl who said __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ we don't want to do that __PUNCT__
ask yourself __PUNCT__ what the altern __PUNCT__ we can't keep do what we ar do __PUNCT__ we got to get realli focus on how we go to have a competit economi __PUNCT__ creat new job __PUNCT__
i know we can do that __PUNCT__
i turn now to someon repres on of our oldest continu oper compani in america locat in upstat new york __PUNCT__ corn __PUNCT__ inc __PUNCT__ a compani that start our make glass and now make a wide varieti of product __PUNCT__
it ha alwai export but ha continu had to reinvent itself __PUNCT__
if it had just stai in the glass busi __PUNCT__ it wouldn't be in busi __PUNCT__
so we have to do the same for our countri __PUNCT__
christin pambianchi is the vice presid of human resourc at corn __PUNCT__
i been work veri close with them over the last sever year becaus thei ar the largest employ in a part of new york and obvious we want to make sure those job stai and grow more job __PUNCT__
christin is here todai to offer some insight into how on american compani is adjust in the face of new econom challeng __PUNCT__
christin __PUNCT__ christin pambianchi __PUNCT__ thank you so much __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__
i veri happi to be here todai to tell you about the great work that senat clinton ha done in partnership with my compani corn incorpor to creat job in upstat new york and not just job __PUNCT__ but green job __PUNCT__
i think when you hear my stori you will see that thi is an exampl that support the plan that she is lai out that could be done on a nation scale were she to be elect presid which obvious i am veri hope for __PUNCT__
we ar a glass and ceram research compani __PUNCT__ as senat clinton mention __PUNCT__
we been around for __NUM__ year and we invent materi __PUNCT__
on of the materi that we invent is a type of ceram that can be made into a filter that will actual clean the emiss from diesel vehicl __PUNCT__
in the unit state todai we have approxim __NUM__ million heavi duti diesel truck and school buse that ar on the road and the govern ha pass requir for cleaner emiss of those __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ if we don't retrofit the __NUM__ million vehicl in the exist fleet __PUNCT__ we will not have a clean fleet until the year __NUM__ __PUNCT__
as senat clinton got to know our countri and some of our technolog __PUNCT__ she also becam awar of and champion caus around clean air and in particular __PUNCT__ school buse __PUNCT__
our children ride around in school buse and ar veri expos to these harm carcinogen and senat clinton champion legisl in washington with the epa and put a program in place call the clean school bu usa program __PUNCT__
thi program set asid moni that school district could appli for to retrofit their school buse __PUNCT__
thi directli support us be abl to creat __NUM__ job in our diesel manufactur facil in upstat new york __PUNCT__
we have __MONEY__ million invest in invent thi busi and build a manufactur plant to manufactur it __PUNCT__
these ar realli good manufactur job in upstat new york and that busi ha continu to grow __PUNCT__
in addit to the initi program with the epa for school buse __PUNCT__ senat clinton ha support retrofit program for the heavi duti diesel manufactur and two other bill in congress and that ha led to the continu growth of the retrofit busi and the continu vibranc of our busi to provid these environment friendli product __PUNCT__
that on __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ veri concret exampl __PUNCT__
anoth stori i want to share with you todai is we do invent thing __PUNCT__
anoth thing that we invent that you mai not all know is that we actual invent optic fiber and optic fiber is actual glass __PUNCT__
we invent that product and we sell that product around the world __PUNCT__
we have a larg manufactur oper in wilmington __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
with recent growth we been abl to re __PUNCT__ open our facil in concord __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
but in the last few year we came under attack in the world market and in particular in china and local compani in china manufactur fiber sought to have our product either bar from entri to the chines market or levi with signific tariff __PUNCT__ upward in the neighborhood of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that would made it imposs for us to enter that market and sell our product there __PUNCT__
we obvious were defend ourselv against those potenti harm act and we call on senat clinton who came to our aid __PUNCT__
she didn't just follow with word __PUNCT__ she actual gave written correspond with the chines govern __PUNCT__ met with them in person on our behalf and we actual prevail and the chines govern side with us and found that our product should be allow to enter those market free from those veri harm tariff __PUNCT__
that again sustain our invest in our research center and our busi that we have in optic fiber __PUNCT__
we have a larg research center in upstat new york __PUNCT__
we have __NUM__ employe that work in both technician __PUNCT__ as well as phd scientist posit invent product __PUNCT__
if you look at the detail of senat clinton stimulu packag __PUNCT__ she call for continu to invest in research and innov and then translat that into manufactur job that we can keep in the unit state __PUNCT__
hopefulli these stori ar good exampl of what she done for her current constitu base and i think she would be abl to do for us on a nation scale __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ there is a lot of job about health care __PUNCT__
you hear from other peopl as well as the senat on that subject __PUNCT__ but it a topic that is veri import to employ __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
as we look to keep job in america and have america be competit in the manufactur environ __PUNCT__ it veri challeng as an employ to figur out how to combat doubl digit growth in your health care cost everi year and then try to keep your manufactur cost balanc so you can be the leader in your market on a global scale __PUNCT__
i think that senat clinton understand these issu from a citizen and an employ and the perspect of what i think is best for the countri and i think that she is best equip to work with us on that issu __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i would just like to offer that i am actual a life __PUNCT__ long new york resid __PUNCT__
i wa born in the bronx __PUNCT__ educ in upstat new york and now i work in new york and i would just like to sai that as a citizen of new york i am so proud of what senat clinton ha done for us as our senat and would just offer person testimoni of what i think she could do for the countri __PUNCT__ so thank you __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ thank you christin __PUNCT__
it been realli a great experi work with corn becaus thei ar commit to their commun and thei ar commit to our countri __PUNCT__
i haven't had that experi with everi compani __PUNCT__
i had to have some pretti strong word with some ceo who were go to move job out of new york even though the plan where those job were be perform wa profit __PUNCT__
and the peopl work in the plant __PUNCT__ some union __PUNCT__ some non __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__ thei all gone the extra mile __PUNCT__
thei cut back on all of the wai thei could to be more effici __PUNCT__
thei chang work rule __PUNCT__
everybodi felt like thei were on the team togeth and product went up and profit went up __PUNCT__
the compani said we could make more monei elsewher __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ to me __PUNCT__ is just so unfair __PUNCT__
what we got to do as we level the plai field is elimin everi singl tax break that peopl still get for export job __PUNCT__
then we got to start put some tax break into support new job and give peopl the incent to keep those job right here __PUNCT__
as you heard from christin and from other __PUNCT__ we keep come back to health care cost and we do it for a reason __PUNCT__
we cannot continu to pai what we pai for health care and remain a competit economi with a strong and prosper middl class __PUNCT__
we just can't __PUNCT__
the averag american famili pai __MONEY__ a year for a famili polici __PUNCT__
some pai out of their pocket __PUNCT__ some it share with the employ __PUNCT__ some get more of a share than other __PUNCT__
__MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
i feel veri strongli about thi issu __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ but i like to bring some addit perspect to bear here __PUNCT__
on of the peopl that came todai you will recogn her compani becaus she is the ceo of weight watcher __PUNCT__
florin mark is in the busi of help peopl lead healthier live __PUNCT__
but she also struggl to help compani provid health care to their employe __PUNCT__
so florin __PUNCT__ would you give us your perspect as a ceo and as a health advoc __PUNCT__ what do you think ar the most import thing we should do to fix our health care system __PUNCT__ florin mark __PUNCT__ first of all let me sai what an honor it is to be sit here with you and everyon around thi tabl and when i listen to the governor __PUNCT__ talk about their state __PUNCT__ michigan ha been in a recess for a while __PUNCT__
we the home of gm and chrysler and ford and when i hear that there ar no more gm plant in your state governor __PUNCT__ it realli pain all of us __PUNCT__
and we ar work veri hard __PUNCT__
we have a fabul governor __PUNCT__ governor jennif granholm who is work so hard and try to bring in job and try to work with the big three and if i could just do a littl commerci __PUNCT__ pleas bui american __PUNCT__
pleas bui american __PUNCT__
health care __PUNCT__
i want to take a differ slant at it becaus i realli come from prevent medicin and what make me so excit about senat clinton is that she realli believ in prevent medicin and that the kei to it all __PUNCT__
that go to lower our health care cost __PUNCT__
she ha a plan which is so veri __PUNCT__ veri __PUNCT__ veri import __PUNCT__
do you know how mani kid ar fail school becaus thei ar fat __PUNCT__ do you know how mani kid ar not get to school becaus thei ar fat __PUNCT__ do you know how mani kid ar dy __PUNCT__ not just grownup but kid who ar dy __PUNCT__
i met a __NUM__ year old the other dai who wa __NUM__ lb overweight with high blood pressur __PUNCT__ high cholesterol __PUNCT__ all of these terribl thing and nobodi seem to be do anyth about it becaus the kid ar sit in front of the comput __PUNCT__
thei ar not realli be motiv to get up __PUNCT__
and the first ting that we cut out when we have to cut out our school system is physic educ __PUNCT__
so educ is extrem __PUNCT__ extrem import __PUNCT__
i want to tell you that i the mother of five __PUNCT__ the stepmoth of two __PUNCT__ that make me a mother of seven and the grandmoth of __NUM__ gorgeou grandchildren __PUNCT__
sever of them ar in colleg __PUNCT__ i have on that is a third year medic student and on that is just start veterinari school and i am so privileg to be abl to help these kid and help pai for their school __PUNCT__
you have no idea how high it is __PUNCT__
i think my medic student is __MONEY__ per year to go to medic school __PUNCT__
just think of how mani potenti einstein and clinton and jona salk and edison that ar out there that will never have an opportun to go to school __PUNCT__ to go to colleg __PUNCT__
therefor your plan on educ excit me __PUNCT__ make me feel safe becaus when i think of presid __PUNCT__ excus me __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ i think of the word safe becaus i know she is kind __PUNCT__ good __PUNCT__ smart __PUNCT__ tough __PUNCT__ she is brilliant __PUNCT__ she is nurtur __PUNCT__ she ha a sympathet part about her __PUNCT__ an empathet part about her __PUNCT__ who will do for the countri what she is go to do for my children and my grandchildren __PUNCT__ hopefulli my great grandchildren and my great __PUNCT__ great grandchildren __PUNCT__
so educ __PUNCT__ prevent medicin __PUNCT__ get peopl to understand how to eat __PUNCT__ how to be healthier __PUNCT__ that veri import __PUNCT__
educ is veri import and i tell you on other thing __PUNCT__
i will onli feel safe if thi woman becom presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i feel that if god forbid __PUNCT__ that phone __PUNCT__ that red phone in the white hous ring __PUNCT__ i want her there to answer it __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ we go to put a moratorium on compliment __PUNCT__
i veri grate for those veri kind remark __PUNCT__ but i realli feel that what you done in emphas prevent is kei __PUNCT__
we can save monei if we actual prevent diseas __PUNCT__ there is a lot of evid __PUNCT__ increas evid that if peopl in health insur plan ar encourag to quit smoke __PUNCT__ to get more exercis __PUNCT__ to eat right __PUNCT__ to take their vitamin __PUNCT__ have their exam __PUNCT__ to do what is necessari to make sure thei ar healthi __PUNCT__
we will actual save monei as well as live __PUNCT__
that what florin tri to do everi singl dai but we have to do it on a broader scale and we need everybodi involv __PUNCT__
busi __PUNCT__ labor __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ everybodi ha got to be focus on thi __PUNCT__
so that we will be part of the bulli pulpit becaus i rememb when i wa in grade school and junior high __PUNCT__ we us to have these presid physic fit award __PUNCT__
i don't know if anybodi rememb those __PUNCT__ rememb that __PUNCT__ onc a year we be taken to the gym and we have to run and jump and do all sort of thing __PUNCT__
i wa never veri good at it __PUNCT__ but i wa there __PUNCT__
and even though i wasn't veri good at it i would get thi certif and it wa sign by the presid and i realli thought presid kennedi wa sit in the white hous sign each and everi on of our certif __PUNCT__
i thought that wa just the greatest thing and i still have them in some scrapbook somewher __PUNCT__
we need to be do that again and on of the real exampl of physic fit __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is john glenn __PUNCT__
john glenn ha been extraordinari all of hi life __PUNCT__
senat john glenn __PUNCT__ you note that i sent here next to florin hope that a littl of thi impact would rub off on me __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ i just thrill that we ar talk about prevent becaus it is so import __PUNCT__
i want to turn now to maril martinez steven __PUNCT__
she is from texa __PUNCT__
she is chairman of the new america allianc which is an organ of latino busi leader who ar devot to the econom advanc of the latino commun and she doe a lot of work develop small busi and support small busi __PUNCT__
small busi is realli under pressur when it come to health care __PUNCT__
so maril __PUNCT__ can you tell us how health care issu ar affect the small busi that you work with in texa __PUNCT__ maril martinez steven __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ thank you veri much for bring small busi to the tabl becaus i think a lot of peopl ar leav small busi out of the discuss __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ small busi emploi more peopl than larger corpor and yet we ar not often at the tabl of discuss __PUNCT__
small busi ar __PUNCT__ as you also know __PUNCT__ overburden in a lot of area and what we ar look for __PUNCT__ what i wa so excit to hear about __PUNCT__ is that you ar look for wai to partner with small busi on how to help them becom less burden and help them hire more peopl and grow __PUNCT__
becaus as most of us know that the economi function realli on the back of small busi __PUNCT__
if small busi is grow healthi __PUNCT__ the economi of the unit state is healthi and grow __PUNCT__
on of the challeng __PUNCT__ and i see a lot with small busi as we ar plan __PUNCT__ health care is a huge __PUNCT__ huge burden __PUNCT__
small busi want to help and to creat health servic for their employe __PUNCT__
we do __PUNCT__
the issu is __PUNCT__ and the reason is __PUNCT__ becaus most of us work with the same peopl over and over either relat or over mani year so thei ar like famili to us __PUNCT__
it is heartbreak when we see that certain peopl like our employe cannot get that care __PUNCT__
i tell you a terribl stori about on of my client that had a young ladi that wa have troubl at work and my client came and said thi employe is wonder __PUNCT__ she alwai been the backbon of my compani __PUNCT__
she be kind of back __PUNCT__ pull back __PUNCT__
and i knew her veri well and i ask her and she had a veri sick child and she wa tell me that her medic wa go to cost __MONEY__ two treatment a week so that she could breath __PUNCT__
she had some kind of pulmonari problem and i said oh my good __PUNCT__ how can it get that expens __PUNCT__ and she said __PUNCT__ we miss on appoint __PUNCT__ becaus it would cost __MONEY__ but now i don't know what i am go to do __PUNCT__
everi time i think about it i get choke up becaus i a mom and i know most of you ar parent and how do you deal with that __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ you can't concentr on work __PUNCT__ you can't do what you want to do becaus you got thi respons to your famili and i start now sever year back work with small busi to find differ solut on how to provid the need health care for their area __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of thing in the tax code that doe allow for some type of reimburs with small busi but noth cover catastroph problem __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ a major accid __PUNCT__ just drive __PUNCT__ you run that risk __PUNCT__
long term diseas __PUNCT__ someth that you didn't know wa come and those kind of thing you can't afford to even help out __PUNCT__
in my case __PUNCT__ the employ wa abl to figur out __PUNCT__ i can help you with that and she thought __PUNCT__ i didn't know you could do that __PUNCT__
but when you talk about hundr of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ even the most care employ can't help __PUNCT__
we ar so excit that you ar look for wai to partner up and look outsid of the realm of how __PUNCT__ especi the idea you talk about with colleg __PUNCT__
graduat ar come out and thei have larg debt and how can we creat incent for them to start a type of busi __PUNCT__
most of you have heard of pre __PUNCT__ paid legal __PUNCT__
i think we need to look at pre __PUNCT__ paid medic so that we can start with the less expens __PUNCT__
so if i have a cough __PUNCT__ if my child ha a cough i can do and i know that it not go to be hundr of dollar and i can get hi medic and i don't have to wait until later on when it is pneumonia and you need more expens equip and more expens medic that can't be afford __PUNCT__
so we look for wai to have real health care and not diseas manag __PUNCT__ which is extrem expens and small busi can't afford it __PUNCT__
so i am realli __PUNCT__ realli excit that you ar invit us to the tabl and look for solut like that so that the small busi can continu to be the backbon of the unit state __PUNCT__
senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ you ar absolut right __PUNCT__
small busi is the backbon and it ha creat the most job in america in the last twenti year and under my health care plan __PUNCT__ small busi would not be requir to provid health care to employe but would be given benefit if thei chose to help __PUNCT__
the problem is if you ar in a small busi __PUNCT__ insur compani can realli discrimin against you __PUNCT__
i think it unconstitut for insur compani to discrimin __PUNCT__
i think thei should not be permit to do that __PUNCT__
the best wai to get the cost down is to get everybodi in the system becaus if you ar in a small busi with ten __PUNCT__ twenti peopl __PUNCT__ it imposs if somebodi get sick __PUNCT__
there is no wai you can continu to afford that group insur __PUNCT__
if you ar in a system with million of peopl then you ar go to be abl to afford it __PUNCT__ so that why we need for small busi __PUNCT__ also to be part of the univers health care system and we can make that happen with the right kind of tax credit and limit on payment and end insur compani discrimin __PUNCT__ which is on of the part of my health care system becaus until we get control over insur compani __PUNCT__ we ar not go to be abl to get the cost down so thei have to be part of the solut __PUNCT__
whether thei ar enthusiast about that or not __PUNCT__ it time that we had doctor and nurs and health care profession and busi and labor and leader at all level of govern work togeth to make these chang that the insur compani will have to go along with __PUNCT__
that what we go to do if we have a chanc to implement it __PUNCT__
final topic is educ and work forc develop __PUNCT__
and zanesvil mayor butch zwell __PUNCT__ the mayor of the y __PUNCT__ bridg citi __PUNCT__ i know you ar work hard to improv the skill and the train of worker here in your citi and that you have had some success in bring some new busi even though you have lost some __PUNCT__ it been someth you work realli hard on __PUNCT__

on of the thing that i think that you ar go to be veri sensit about is commun develop and block grant find __PUNCT__
we have been cut __PUNCT__ cut __PUNCT__ cut under the bush administr __PUNCT__
we lost __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of that fund sinc __NUM__ and i spoke befor a congression sub committe a coupl of year ago when presid bush wa threaten to cut the whole program out as a wai to balanc hi budget __PUNCT__
presid bush doesn't understand that thi is the tip of appalachia __PUNCT__ that there ar peopl in thi area that do not have water and sewer and he doesn't have a clue about that __PUNCT__
i know that you do and we ar so excit about your come to the white hous to do someth about that becaus that involv infrastructur __PUNCT__ waterlin __PUNCT__ sewer line __PUNCT__
that involv job __PUNCT__
we have to have that kind of monei in order to oper as a commun __PUNCT__

the wai that the feder govern under presid bush and the republican congress ha cut a lot of the aid that came to commun ha put extra burden on your tax payer and that is someth that we will definit address becaus it veri hard for you to manag a lot of the need you have if you ar just reli upon your own resourc __PUNCT__

what make it difficult for us is the high cost of tuition and in ohio we do have a high cost __PUNCT__

that what i believ __PUNCT__
i realli appreci everyon come out todai __PUNCT__ becaus we want thi to be an ongo convers __PUNCT__
there ar lot of good idea that peopl have and we been work to come up with what will make a differ __PUNCT__
what might work in ohio might not work in texa __PUNCT__ and so we got to have a varieti of approach __PUNCT__
the feder govern need to be a partner __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ that mean we got to listen and we got to be avail __PUNCT__
it what i believ we do best if we actual roll up our sleev and get to work togeth __PUNCT__
i put out thi __PUNCT__ solut for america __PUNCT__ econom blueprint __PUNCT__ you can pick up copi on the wai out __PUNCT__
it an abbrevi version __PUNCT__ but it put out some of the idea that i believ could make a differ __PUNCT__
at the end of the dai we have to decid what kind of futur we want __PUNCT__
it doesn't happen by accid __PUNCT__
what laura wa sai __PUNCT__ you just don't stai at home and sai i think i dream my wai to a higher educ __PUNCT__ you got to put on your boot __PUNCT__ you got to walk through the snow __PUNCT__ you got to deliv the applic __PUNCT__ you got to attend the class __PUNCT__ you got to be qualifi __PUNCT__

but the real question for us is not whether chang will happen __PUNCT__ chang is go to happen whether we want it or not __PUNCT__
chang is a part of life __PUNCT__
it whether progress will happen __PUNCT__
whether we see the kind of progress here in ohio and texa and america that the peopl of our countri deserv __PUNCT__
so i veri confid and optimist about what we go to do togeth __PUNCT__
and i veri grate that we would have thi opportun with so mani distinguish ohioan and visitor from around our countri to talk about what we go to do to make ohio as import and prosper and success to america futur as it wa __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ to america past __PUNCT__
