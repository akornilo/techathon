mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ we ar all well awar in thi chamber that our countri find itself in a deepen crisi in iraq __PUNCT__ and we find ourselv at a moment of decis in the unit state senat __PUNCT__
nearli four year ago __PUNCT__ our presid rush us into war in iraq __PUNCT__ a war now longer than american involv in world war ii __PUNCT__ which next month will actual exce the length of our own civil war __PUNCT__
for four year __PUNCT__ member on both side of the aisl have watch with shock and dismai as our presid ha made mistak __PUNCT__ after misjudg __PUNCT__ after miscalcul __PUNCT__
even befor the invas end __PUNCT__ the administr reject the volumin plan drawn up by the state depart to deal with the chaotic aftermath __PUNCT__
the success exampl of the u. __PUNCT__ experi in bosnia and kosovo dure the 1990 were summarili reject __PUNCT__
state depart and other offici with experi in nation __PUNCT__ build were blackbal in favor of inexperienc ideologu who were select on the basi of polit litmu test __PUNCT__ includ answer question about whether thei were for or against roe v __PUNCT__ wade and whether thei had vote for georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
despit the urgent warn of armi chief of staff eric shinseki and other senior militari command __PUNCT__ the necessari number of troop to ensur secur and stabil were not sent at the start of the conflict __PUNCT__
our men and women in uniform were order into harm wai without the necessari bodi armor or armor vehicl __PUNCT__ a mortal error i have tri to correct time and again sinc i first learn of it __PUNCT__
the strateg blunder now fill an entir librari shelf of book __PUNCT__ and thei ar certainli too numer for me to list in the time allot here __PUNCT__
through these four year __PUNCT__ there ha also been anoth abdic of respons __PUNCT__
that wa the failur of thi congress to engag in it constitut oblig of the major refus to hold the administr account __PUNCT__
in the elect last year __PUNCT__ the american peopl decid that the statu quo wa no longer accept __PUNCT__
so we have a new congress __PUNCT__ and it is past time that we in thi chamber do our duti to balanc the presid and provid a check against hi fail polici in iraq __PUNCT__
there is a major against thi situat in iraq __PUNCT__ there is a bipartisan consensu in thi chamber as well __PUNCT__
the resolut reflect that consensu as it reflect the overwhelm major of american __PUNCT__
but a partisan minor seek to shield the administr continu failur in iraq seek to thwart the bipartisan major and the will of the american peopl __PUNCT__
thi is not a debat about abstract __PUNCT__
i have seen the consequ of our involv in iraq __PUNCT__ as have mani of my fellow senat __PUNCT__
three week ago __PUNCT__ i visit iraq to express gratitud to our soldier __PUNCT__ to meet with iraqi leader and u. __PUNCT__ command __PUNCT__ and our troop on the ground __PUNCT__
what i saw and what i did not see underscor my concern __PUNCT__
i saw american servicemen and women perform their duti admir __PUNCT__ but i did not see a strategi that under the current circumst ha much chanc of success __PUNCT__
the collect analysi of our intellig commun in the latest nation intellig estim is that the term __PUNCT__ civil war __PUNCT__ doe not adequ captur the complex of the conflict in iraq __PUNCT__
the bipartisan baker __PUNCT__ hamilton commiss said __PUNCT__ the situat in iraq is grave and deterior __PUNCT__
yet the presid respons to the bipartisan commiss and the latest nation intellig estim doe not match the urgenc that is describ __PUNCT__
the so __PUNCT__ call surg is not a new strategi __PUNCT__ but a tactic that ha been tri and fail __PUNCT__
the absenc of leadership on the part of the presid leav congress no choic but to demonstr the leadership that the american peopl and the realiti on the ground demand __PUNCT__
the previou two congress abdic their duti __PUNCT__
we must not __PUNCT__
everi singl dai __PUNCT__ our feet sink deeper into the sand __PUNCT__
everi dai the crisi worsen __PUNCT__
to hide from thi debat with our troop in such danger is wrong __PUNCT__ plain and simpl __PUNCT__
the crisi in iraq ha foster a crisi of democraci here at home __PUNCT__
the american peopl expect a debat __PUNCT__
our troop ar ow a debat __PUNCT__
and our constitut command that we debat __PUNCT__
but a partisan minor __PUNCT__ act at the behest of the administr __PUNCT__ is stand in the wai __PUNCT__
thi amount to a gag rule on our democraci __PUNCT__ contrari to the nation secur interest of the unit state __PUNCT__
even though america vote for a new direct in iraq __PUNCT__ even though the major of senat oppos escal in iraq __PUNCT__ we cannot get the republican to allow us to take a symbol vote to condemn the escal __PUNCT__ much less a real vote to stop it __PUNCT__
thi resolut deserv a debat __PUNCT__ it deserv a vote __PUNCT__ and it deserv passag __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar those in the chamber who invok our brave troop __PUNCT__ suggest that a debat on the most import issu face our countri and face our troop would somehow undermin the mission and weaken our nation __PUNCT__
it is a pernici __PUNCT__ shame argument __PUNCT__ and it is dead wrong __PUNCT__
our democraci is stronger than that __PUNCT__ and the american peopl and our troop deserv better than that __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ our troop understand we ar debat thi war __PUNCT__
we debat it not just in thi chamber __PUNCT__ we debat it in kitchen tabl convers and around water cooler and stand in line at supermarket __PUNCT__
we debat thi war everywher american gather __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ our troop ar debat thi war __PUNCT__ and the american peopl understand that it is the polici that undermin our nation secur and interest __PUNCT__ not a vote disapprov the polici __PUNCT__
thi debat and thi resolut have merit and purpos and it will __PUNCT__ if permit to go forward __PUNCT__ begin the process of chang the polici __PUNCT__
otherwis __PUNCT__ why would the administr and my colleagu on the other side of the aisl fought so hard to prevent us from have a debat and a vote __PUNCT__ becaus thei understand that thi will be the first step to restor our strength and renew our leadership around the world __PUNCT__ to begin redeploi our troop out of iraq and start on the long road to undo the damag brought by the presid __PUNCT__ to america leadership around the world __PUNCT__
if you believ the escal is the right strategi __PUNCT__ then cast your vote for it __PUNCT__
but if you believ __PUNCT__ as the major in thi chamber believ __PUNCT__ that escal is not the right strategi __PUNCT__ then cast your vote against it __PUNCT__
but stand on the sidelin is no wai to stand up for the troop __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar mani __PUNCT__ both in the chamber and outsid __PUNCT__ who would wish to go further than thi resolut and look for wai to bind the action of the presid and to requir him to chang cours __PUNCT__
i understand and agre with the frustrat that ha afflict mani of us in deal with the presid polici __PUNCT__ but if we can get a bipartisan vote against escal __PUNCT__ it will be the first time the senat ha exercis it constitut respons to be a check and balanc on the presid __PUNCT__
the first step for the senat will be a giant leap toward account and toward the right end to thi war __PUNCT__
there is a big differ between call for the end of thi war and do the difficult __PUNCT__ painstak work of build the polit will within the congress to take action __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ in the senat __PUNCT__ entrust by our constitu to cast tough vote __PUNCT__ should not have the luxuri of stand outsid the arena and lob critic from within __PUNCT__
onc we pass thi resolut __PUNCT__ we should go further __PUNCT__
rather than an escal of us troop __PUNCT__ which will not contribut to fundament chang the condit on the ground __PUNCT__ we should put pressur on the iraqi govern in a wai that thei will understand there ar consequ to their empti promis and their continu inact __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ the nation intellig council releas the unclassifi kei judgment of the nation intellig estim on iraq __PUNCT__
that present the consensu view of the unit state intellig commun __PUNCT__ and it underscor the need for a polit solut __PUNCT__
the nie state that in the come __NUM__ to __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the overal secur situat will continu to deterior at rate compar to the latter part of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and ot goe on further to sai that even if violenc is diminish __PUNCT__ given the current winner __PUNCT__ take __PUNCT__ all attitud and sectarian animos infect the polit scene __PUNCT__ iraqi leader will be hard __PUNCT__ press to achiev sustain polit reconcili in the time frame of the estim __PUNCT__ name __PUNCT__ a year to a year __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__
even if __PUNCT__ the intellig expert argu __PUNCT__ the escal result in greater secur __PUNCT__ their best judgment is that the bloodsh and violenc will continu to spiral out of control __PUNCT__
so what should we do __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ mani of us believ __PUNCT__ and we been argu for thi and vote for thi for more than a year __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__ that we have to chart a new cours that emphas greater iraqi respons __PUNCT__
i still believ that is the path we should be take __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ the presid ha chosen a veri narrow cours that reli heavili on american militari forc __PUNCT__
i will be introduc legisl that i think offer a better altern __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ my legisl will cap the number of troop in iraq as of __DATE__ and will requir the administr to seek congression author for ani addit troop __PUNCT__
the presid ha final said thi is not an open __PUNCT__ end commit in iraq __PUNCT__ but he is provid the iraqi with an open __PUNCT__ end presenc of american troop __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ as a mean to increas our leverag with the iraqi govern and to clearli send a messag that there ar consequ to their inact __PUNCT__ i would impos condit for continu fund of the iraqi secur forc and the privat contractor work for the iraqi __PUNCT__
my legisl would requir certif that the secur forc were free of sectarian and militia influenc and were actual assum greater respons for iraqi secur along with other condit __PUNCT__
we must not let us fund __PUNCT__ taxpay fund __PUNCT__ be us to train member of sectarian militia who ar respons for so much of the violenc in iraq __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ it appear that our fund to iraqi secur forc mai be go to the peopl we ar try to restrain __PUNCT__
a new report last week in an articl entitl __PUNCT__ mahdi armi gain strength through unwit aid of us __PUNCT__ report that the u. __PUNCT__ militari drive to train and equip iraq secur forc ha unwittingli strengthen anti __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__ shiit muslim cleric muqtada al __PUNCT__ sadr mahdi armi militia __PUNCT__ which ha been battl to take over much of the capit citi as american forc ar try to secur it __PUNCT__
accord to thi new report __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ armi command __PUNCT__ and enlist men who ar patrol east of baghdad said al __PUNCT__ sadr militia had heavili infiltr the iraqi polic and armi unit that thei train and arm __PUNCT__
said on soldier __PUNCT__ thei wave at us dure the dai and shoot at us dure the night __PUNCT__
we need to inform the iraqi govern in no uncertain term that there ar consequ __PUNCT__ term that there ar consequ __PUNCT__ that we will take fund awai from their troop __PUNCT__ not from our troop __PUNCT__ mani of whom still lack armor vehicl and counterinsurg measur devic and commun equip __PUNCT__
and we will not fund the iraqi if our troop ar go to enter into sectarian battl where some of the particip have receiv american train and support __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i would hold the administr account for their empti promis as well __PUNCT__
my bill requir the bush administr to certifi that iraq ha disarm the militia __PUNCT__ ha ensur that a law ha final been pass for the equit share of oil revenu __PUNCT__ that the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ under american influenc and even pressur __PUNCT__ ha made the constitut chang necessari to ensur right for minor commun __PUNCT__ that the de __PUNCT__ baathif process ha been revers to allow teacher __PUNCT__ profession __PUNCT__ and other who join the baath parti as a mean to get a job to serv in the iraqi govern __PUNCT__
i would also requir the administr to engag in a region diplomat initi includ all of iraq neighbor to address iraq futur and to understand and convei clearli that the unit state expect iraq neighbor in the stabil and secur of the new iraqi state __PUNCT__
if these condit ar not met or ar not on their wai to be met within six month __PUNCT__ a new congression author requir would be trigger __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i would prohibit ani spend to increas troop level unless __PUNCT__ and until __PUNCT__ the secretari of defens certifi that our american troop will have the proper train and equip for whatev mission thei ar order to fulfil __PUNCT__
yesterdai i read the classifi report outlin the find by the depart of defens inspector gener about the problem that have been face by our troop get the equip thei desper need in combat area like iraq __PUNCT__
the inspector gener did not have the full cooper of the depart of defens and it is heartbreak that the inspector gener could conclud that the u. __PUNCT__ militari still ha fail to equip our soldier in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ especi for the kind of warfar that thei ar confront with i and insurg who ar attack them in asymmetr __PUNCT__ unconvent warfar __PUNCT__
thi report come on the heal of an articl in the washington post last week entitl __PUNCT__ equip for troop is lack __PUNCT__ troop must make do __PUNCT__ offici sai __PUNCT__
the washington post stori rais seriou question about the adequaci of the suppli of up __PUNCT__ armor humve and truck __PUNCT__
on of our gener is quot as sai that he doesn't have the equip that our forc need and thei will have to go into battl with what thei have __PUNCT__
on my wai back from iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ i stop at landstuhl hospit in germani to visit with some of our wound soldier __PUNCT__
i met with on young man who wa ly in hi bed with hi injuri that he had suffer from on of the shape charg __PUNCT__ these new __PUNCT__ more advanc __PUNCT__ more sophist command __PUNCT__ control i __PUNCT__ the improvis explos devic __PUNCT__
he told me that the armor fulli equip humve that save hi life and that of the life __PUNCT__ the live of hi buddi who were with him __PUNCT__
but he also told me that not everybodi that he serv with had that kind of protect becaus there weren't enough of those armor vehicl to go around __PUNCT__
madam presid __PUNCT__ i do not believ that the congress can shirk it respons __PUNCT__
it is past time that we live up to our constitut respons __PUNCT__
if i had been presid in __DATE__ of __NUM__ i would have never ask for author to divert our attent from afghanistan to iraq __PUNCT__ and i certainli would never have start thi war __PUNCT__
but we ar where we ar __PUNCT__ and thi congress must deliv a strategi to help us end thi war in the right wai and begin return our troop home __PUNCT__
so on thi most import issu of our time __PUNCT__ i call on my colleagu __PUNCT__ not to hide from thi debat __PUNCT__ but to welcom it __PUNCT__
to welcom the opportun to set forth whatev on opinion might be __PUNCT__ becaus thi debat is about more than our polici in iraq __PUNCT__
it is about the role and respons of thi __DATE__ institut __PUNCT__
great debat in our past have not onli move public opinion but further the progress of our countri __PUNCT__
thi debat is not mere about whether or not the presid should escal troop into iraq __PUNCT__ whether he ha fail to grasp the complex of the situat we confront in iraq and to take everi diplomat __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ and militari strategi avail to him __PUNCT__ but it realli about our democraci itself __PUNCT__
we should consid thi resolut __PUNCT__
and i hope that we will __PUNCT__
our duti is root in the faith entrust to us by our constitu and enshrin in our constitut __PUNCT__
when we think about the patriot and braveri __PUNCT__ the humor and resolv __PUNCT__ the optim and strength of our soldier __PUNCT__ marin __PUNCT__ airmen __PUNCT__ and sailor __PUNCT__ our activ duti __PUNCT__ our guard and reserv __PUNCT__ i think it humbl us all __PUNCT__
but it come out of thi great democrat tradit that we ar all bless to be a part of __PUNCT__
i hope that we have the opportun in the next dai to do our duti __PUNCT__ just as the men and women who ar serv us have done and ar do their __PUNCT__
a week ago i wa privileg to go to san antonio for the open of a remark center call the center of the intrepid __PUNCT__
it is a new state __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ art facil devot to the rehabilit and recoveri of our wound hero __PUNCT__
it wa fund by contribut from more than __NUM__ american __PUNCT__
it wa not built by our govern __PUNCT__
it wa built by our citizen __PUNCT__
it is not onli go to be a place of great hope and heal for the brave men and women who have given their full measur __PUNCT__ but it will also stand as a symbol of our democraci __PUNCT__ of our valu __PUNCT__ of peopl come togeth across our countri __PUNCT__ a uniqu partnership that you find nowher els in the world except here __PUNCT__
as i sat on the stage dure the ceremoni for the open of thi new rehabilit center __PUNCT__ i watch the hundr of young men and women who had been injur march in __PUNCT__ in some case wheel in __PUNCT__ and take their place in the audienc __PUNCT__
i believ thei ar ow thi debat __PUNCT__ and certainli all those who ar current serv and the thousand who ar on their wai to carri out thi escal strategi deserv it even more __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ madam presid __PUNCT__ i hope we will have a chanc to express the will of our constitu __PUNCT__ our deepli held opinion __PUNCT__ and particip in a debat that is histor and necessari __PUNCT__
that is the least we can do __PUNCT__
