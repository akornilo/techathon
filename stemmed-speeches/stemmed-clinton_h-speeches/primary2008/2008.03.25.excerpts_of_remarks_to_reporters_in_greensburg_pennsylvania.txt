that is a veri signific differ between the two of us __PUNCT__ __URL__ as you know ha a higher percentag of older peopl than most state so it is a particular concern to a lot of pennsylvanian who ar on social secur __PUNCT__ like a coupl we heard from earlier todai who keep see their expens increas and realiz that thei ar in a veri difficult posit try to afford all of the necess of life and be on a fix incom like thei ar __PUNCT__
