these ar not just common valu __PUNCT__
thei ar our core valu __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ and human right __PUNCT__ women right __PUNCT__ a robust civil societi __PUNCT__
and we stand with israel __PUNCT__ becaus israel demonstr that democraci can flourish in the most difficult condit __PUNCT__ becaus it veri exist is a sting rebuk to hatr and the holocaust __PUNCT__ becaus in defeat terror israel caus is our caus __PUNCT__ and becaus israel struggl is a struggl not just for the jewish peopl but for all peopl who want to live in peac and secur under a democrat elect govern __PUNCT__
presid harri truman certainli understood the import of israel __PUNCT__
he recogn the new nation just __NUM__ minut after david ben __PUNCT__ gurion read the proclam of independ __PUNCT__
so it is with joi and some sens of relief that we celebr the __NUM__ anniversari of that dai __PUNCT__
and for all of the trial and tear __PUNCT__ what a remark __NUM__ year it ha been __PUNCT__
from my first trip to israel in __NUM__ to my most recent __PUNCT__ i have seen firsthand what israel ha achiev __PUNCT__ the desert is bloom again __PUNCT__
and we can be so proud of the role that america ha plai in thi success __PUNCT__
everi american presid sinc truman recogn the special relationship and ha made it stronger __PUNCT__
israel is stronger becaus of us and becaus of you __PUNCT__
but even as we celebr these achiev __PUNCT__ we know the work is far from over __PUNCT__
israel is not yet safe __PUNCT__
the valu that israel repres ar not yet secur __PUNCT__
our heart go out in particular to the courag citizen of citi like sderot and ashkelon who live in fear that a rocket will fall on their home or their children school at ani moment __PUNCT__
i have seen these secur challeng firsthand __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i went to the sbarro pizzeria with then presid olmert just a few week after that tragic suicid bomb there __PUNCT__
i visit with victim of terror in the hadassah hospit __PUNCT__
i have been to gilo and seen the secur fenc protect isra famili from attack in their own home __PUNCT__
i have stood up and have spoken out for their right to have that protect fenc __PUNCT__
as a senat from new york __PUNCT__ who ha talk wai too much __PUNCT__ i have seen the tragic toll of terror on 9/11 here at home as well __PUNCT__
my support for israel doe not come recent or lightli __PUNCT__
i know it is right in my head __PUNCT__ in my heart and in my gut __PUNCT__
and that is exactli the commit we need in our next presid __PUNCT__ a democrat presid __PUNCT__ becaus the democrat parti strong commit to the state of israel sinc the dai of harri truman endur todai __PUNCT__
it is on of our parti most cherish valu and it will continu under the next democrat presid __PUNCT__
i know senat obama understand what it is at stake here __PUNCT__
it ha been an honor to contest these primari with him __PUNCT__
it is an honor to call him my friend __PUNCT__
and let me be veri clear __PUNCT__ i know that senat obama will be a good friend to israel __PUNCT__
i know that senat obama share my view that the next presid must be readi to sai to the world __PUNCT__ america posit is unchang __PUNCT__ our resolv unyield __PUNCT__ our stanc nonnegoti __PUNCT__
the unit state stand with israel __PUNCT__ now and forev __PUNCT__
let me underscor that i believ we need a democrat in the white hous next __DATE__ becaus it is not just israel that face challeng in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ america doe __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
the next presid will inherit grave problem __PUNCT__ difficult threat __PUNCT__ a war in afghanistan and a war in iraq __PUNCT__ america reput at an all __PUNCT__ time low __PUNCT__ the continu threat of terror at home and abroad __PUNCT__
presid bush ha move us in the wrong direct __PUNCT__
for all the strong rhetor you heard from senat mccain on mondai __PUNCT__ he will continu the same fail polici in iraq and weaken our secur __PUNCT__ make the middl east a more danger place __PUNCT__
america need a new begin in our foreign polici to make our countri stronger and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ to make our posit in the world more credibl __PUNCT__ to give us the strateg leverag back that we have lost over the last seven year __PUNCT__
we cannot stand strongli with israel if we ar not strong at home and if we ar not respect and consid strong and the leader of the world everywher els __PUNCT__
we have a rare moment of opportun to chang america cours and restor our stand in the world __PUNCT__
we must seiz thi moment by lead our friend and alli in build the world we want rather than simpli defend against a world we fear __PUNCT__
we must build a world that will be safer __PUNCT__ more prosper __PUNCT__ and more just __PUNCT__
i believ secur and opportun go hand __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hand __PUNCT__
when children have hope __PUNCT__ a real belief that there is opportun ahead for them __PUNCT__ we help to dry up the swamp of fear and pessim that breed terror __PUNCT__
that mean support educ __PUNCT__ not just for boi but for girl too __PUNCT__
it also mean that real econom opportun can't grow where there is no secur __PUNCT__
and that opportun alon is not enough to overcom extrem __PUNCT__
i have been veri specif about how i would make thi new foreign polici vision that i share __PUNCT__ and i think mani of you do as well __PUNCT__ a realiti __PUNCT__
todai i want to lai out three principl that i hope will guid us in all that we do with israel and why it is import to put that relationship into the broader context of what foreign polici is in the best interest of the unit state __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i have a bedrock commit to israel secur becaus israel secur is critic to our secur __PUNCT__
when islam extremist __PUNCT__ includ the leader of nation __PUNCT__ proclaim death to america __PUNCT__ death to israel __PUNCT__ we understand that our two nation ar fight a share threat __PUNCT__
those of us in thi room know thi bond is so much more person than ani secur agreement or risk assess __PUNCT__
we know a share threat can also mean share sorrow __PUNCT__
when eight young men were kill in a jerusalem yeshiva in march includ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old american name abraham david mose __PUNCT__ we reunit in our grief __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i strongli support israel right to self __PUNCT__ defens __PUNCT__
israel ha both the right and the oblig to defend it citizen and i believ america should aid in that defens __PUNCT__
i am proud to support the __MONEY__ billion in secur assist for israel and the foreign aid bill and i am commit in make sure that israel maintain a militari edg to meet increas threat __PUNCT__
part of our commit israel secur is a commit to the isra __PUNCT__ palestinian peac process __PUNCT__
i am deepli move by the legaci of so mani leader who have sacrif so much in the quest for peac __PUNCT__ like my friend yitzhak rabin __PUNCT__ and the warrior __PUNCT__ ariel sharon __PUNCT__ who is in our thought and prayer __PUNCT__
we must support israel and in make the tough choic for peac __PUNCT__
i believ that u. __PUNCT__ diplomaci is critic to make progress and consist u. __PUNCT__ involv can lower the level of violenc and restor our credibl in the region __PUNCT__
we need to talk to all side but all parti must know we will alwai stand with israel in it struggl for peac and secur __PUNCT__
israel should know that the unit state will never pressur her to make unilater concess or to impos a made __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ america solut __PUNCT__
palestinian will need to do their part by renounc violenc and teach their children the wai of peac and toler __PUNCT__
we must show palestinian and moder arab that the path of reconcili is better than the terrorist road to self __PUNCT__ destruct __PUNCT__
i am deepli concern about the grow threat in gaza __PUNCT__
hama ha built a militari forc equip with sophist weapon from iran __PUNCT__
hama __PUNCT__ campaign of terror ha claim the live of hundr of innoc isra __PUNCT__
it charter call for the destruct of israel __PUNCT__
it ha shown no commit to peac or to renounc violenc __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we must be clear about how we feel about our next presid negoti directli with hama __PUNCT__
here is how i feel __PUNCT__ until hama renounc terror and recogn israel __PUNCT__ negoti with hama is unaccept for the unit state __PUNCT__
we must continu to demand a return of the isra soldier captur by hama and by hezbollah __PUNCT__ ehud goldwass __PUNCT__ eldad regev __PUNCT__ gilad shalit __PUNCT__
i have been privileg to know karnit goldwass __PUNCT__ ehud wife and i wa proud to sponsor the resolut that pass the senat call for their immedi releas __PUNCT__
i will not stop fight and press for these soldier to come home until thei final ar safe home with the famili that ar wait for them __PUNCT__
the second principl is a simpl on __PUNCT__ no nuclear weapon for iran __PUNCT__
iran is a countri whose leader __PUNCT__ whose presid deni the holocaust __PUNCT__
he defi the intern commun __PUNCT__
hi govern train __PUNCT__ fund __PUNCT__ and arm hama and hezbollah terrorist in attack isra civilian __PUNCT__
he threaten to destroi israel __PUNCT__
just thi week __PUNCT__ he said that israel is about to die and will soon be eras __PUNCT__
we can never let iran obtain nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the next presid will have to deal with the iranian challeng from dai on __PUNCT__
thi is not just in israel interest __PUNCT__
it is in america interest and the world interest __PUNCT__ and thi is a threat that i take veri serious __PUNCT__
i a co __PUNCT__ sponsor the iran nonprolifer act __PUNCT__
i support call the iranian revolutionari guard what it is __PUNCT__ a terrorist organ __PUNCT__
i have also said that should iran ever __PUNCT__ ever contempl us nuclear weapon against israel __PUNCT__ thei must understand what the consequ will be to them __PUNCT__
but we must do everyth in our power to prevent such an unthink dai from ever happen and the best wai to do that is to stop iran from get nuclear weapon in the first place __PUNCT__
we should start by develop an intern consensu against iran nuclear program with a set of tougher sanction if iran continu to defi the intern commun __PUNCT__
we should also work with israel and moder arab neighbor to roll back iran influenc in that region __PUNCT__
if the iranian govern want to becom a respons member of the intern commun __PUNCT__ we would wholeheartedli welcom that chang but iran simpli cannot be allow to continu it current behavior and i wish to underscor i believ that we ar further behind in constrain iran todai becaus of the fail polici of presid bush than we would have been had we taken a much more aggress engag cours earlier __PUNCT__
that is why it is imper that we get both tough and smart about deal with iran befor it is too late __PUNCT__
now my third principl is stand up against hatr and anti __PUNCT__ semit wherev it is found and it is not onli isra and jew who need to be speak out against anti __PUNCT__ semit __PUNCT__ it is everi fair __PUNCT__ think person who understand that it directli affect you as well __PUNCT__
i have spoken out for year against anti __PUNCT__ semit in palestinian school __PUNCT__
i am appal __PUNCT__ still todai __PUNCT__ the palestinian textbook reject israel right to exist and describ israel found as a catastroph that unpreced in histori __PUNCT__
that is not educ __PUNCT__ it is indoctrin __PUNCT__
we also know that the saudi have textbook describ jew as wick and we were all revolt when iran presid held a confer to deni the holocaust __PUNCT__ but our vigil against anti __PUNCT__ semit must go beyond the middl east __PUNCT__
it must receiv no quarter anywher in the world __PUNCT__
the next presid will face a test of resolv on thi issu __PUNCT__ at the __NUM__ durban confer __PUNCT__ also call the durban ii __PUNCT__
i will never forget how the world first confer against racism becam a mockeri of itself when it descend into anti __PUNCT__ semit and hatr __PUNCT__
the debacl at durban must never be repeat __PUNCT__
we should take veri strong action to ensur anti __PUNCT__ semit is kept off the agenda at durban ii and if those effort fail __PUNCT__ i believ that the unit state should boycott that confer __PUNCT__
the challeng of fight anti __PUNCT__ semit is inde great __PUNCT__ but we know it is possibl to chang heart and mind __PUNCT__
we saw it recent when magen david adom wa final includ in the intern red cross after year of be singl out for be isra __PUNCT__
on on of my trip to israel __PUNCT__ i met an mda member name natan __PUNCT__ an ethiopian jew who had save mani innoc live when he tackl a terrorist carri explos __PUNCT__
it wa a miracl that natan had surviv __PUNCT__
hi valor wa extraordinari and it wa just what you would expect from a member of the mda __PUNCT__
that why i wa so proud to take up the mda caus __PUNCT__ sponsor legisl and speak out __PUNCT__
and i wa veri pleas as all of us were when the intern red cross right thi histor wrong __PUNCT__
on a person level __PUNCT__ i wa honor when natan accept my invit to come to new york and walk with me in our salut to israel parad __PUNCT__
in a wai we ar still walk togeth and the imag of thi veri dignifi ethiopian jew __PUNCT__ now an isra __PUNCT__ walk in that parad down fifth avenu __PUNCT__ bear the scar of hi heroic rescu effort to prevent the terrorist from destroi more live __PUNCT__ wa on i will carri with me my entir life becaus that wa realli israel __PUNCT__
it wasn't just everyon on the side of the street wave __PUNCT__
it wa thi proud young man who had kept jewish tradit aliv and as a long string of those for centuri who had done so and who had final come home to israel and had given so much to protect the countri that had given him a new life __PUNCT__
so while it can be easi to be discourag when we look at the challeng ahead __PUNCT__ we can never lose our resolv and never give up hope __PUNCT__
what give me not just hope but the underli realiti that can be deliv by those who work togeth __PUNCT__ is that the power of the valu we share with israel ar such an unshak and unbreak bond __PUNCT__ and the differ that america can make is so critic __PUNCT__
let me leav you with just in glimps of why america matter and why aipac matter __PUNCT__
in her memoir __PUNCT__ on of my person heroin __PUNCT__ golda meir __PUNCT__ wrote about the wonder moment __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ when israel join the famili of nation and america stood at her side __PUNCT__
here is what she wrote __PUNCT__ a few minut after midnight __PUNCT__ my phone rang __PUNCT__
it had been ring all even and as i ran to answer it __PUNCT__ i wonder what bad new i would hear now __PUNCT__
doesn't that sound familiar __PUNCT__ but the voic at the other end of the phone sound jubil __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ golda __PUNCT__ ar you listen __PUNCT__ truman ha recogn us __PUNCT__
i can rememb what i said or did but i rememb how i felt __PUNCT__
it wa like a miracl and i wa fill with joi and relief __PUNCT__
that wa the decis that on american presid made __PUNCT__ to be there for israel at a time of need __PUNCT__
that is the decis that the next presid must be readi to make as well __PUNCT__
to the member of aipac __PUNCT__ just know your caus is just __PUNCT__ your voic is strong __PUNCT__
washington and the world is listen __PUNCT__
so go forth and speak up for what you know is right __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__
god bless israel and god bless america __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
