let us not give up meet togeth __PUNCT__ as some ar in the habit of do __PUNCT__ but let us encourag on anoth and all the more as you see the dai approach __PUNCT__
i grew up in a differ faith tradit __PUNCT__ as a methodist __PUNCT__
i know there is at least on bishop from my tradit here who came to show solidar __PUNCT__
i appreci that __PUNCT__
much like all of you __PUNCT__ i wa taught from a veri earli ag that my faith carri with it certain oblig __PUNCT__

it transform my life as it did so mani other who had the great honor to hear directli from dr __PUNCT__ king the call to be more than on our own __PUNCT__ ani of us could be __PUNCT__
i have been a prai person __PUNCT__ luckili __PUNCT__ my entir life __PUNCT__
i often ask whether or not i am __PUNCT__
i am quick to tell peopl that i wa rais by parent who were prayer and by a church that guid me but had i not been a prai person __PUNCT__ on week in the white hous would turn me into a prai person __PUNCT__
everydai i try to act on the lesson of my faith __PUNCT__ to reach that higher place __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ so often __PUNCT__ like all of us __PUNCT__ i fall short __PUNCT__
but each new dai __PUNCT__ i keep strive and prai to work harder __PUNCT__ to correct my imperfect __PUNCT__ to improv on the dai befor and on the dai befor that __PUNCT__
that what i tri to do in my person life but also in everi aspect of my public life __PUNCT__
that how i try to go about the work of break barrier and expand opportun __PUNCT__
work that i __PUNCT__ myself have benefit from throughout my life __PUNCT__
that is how i practic my faith __PUNCT__
i live by the scriptur that sai we ar all member of god household __PUNCT__
that we ar call __PUNCT__ not ask __PUNCT__ not urg __PUNCT__ not request __PUNCT__ nor order __PUNCT__ but call to love on anoth as jesu ha love us __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i not talk about love that come easi __PUNCT__
i not talk about the greet card kind of love __PUNCT__
i talk about the kind of love that is hard __PUNCT__
the deeper __PUNCT__ more power love in corinthian that bear all thing __PUNCT__ believ all thing __PUNCT__ hope all thing __PUNCT__ endur all thing __PUNCT__
i talk about the kind of love that we have seen in action __PUNCT__
the love that fill the heart of my friend __PUNCT__ congressman john lewi __PUNCT__ a man that lead the march in selma that end with tear ga __PUNCT__ hose and the crack of the nightstick against hi skull as he knelt down to prai __PUNCT__
as he knelt down the prai __PUNCT__ that nightstick came up and down on a prai man head __PUNCT__
that wa just on of the mani time john wa attack on hi journei for justic __PUNCT__
but those of us know john lewi know that he doesn't harbor hate in ani fiber of hi be __PUNCT__
that the kind of love i talk about __PUNCT__
i talk about the love that fill the heart of presid nelson mandela __PUNCT__
i had the honor of get to know him over the year and i attend hi inaugur __PUNCT__
i will never forget how he stood up on that stage and said how proud he wa to welcom all of the dignitari in attend __PUNCT__ but there were three peopl he especi want to welcom __PUNCT__
then he ask three of hi jailer from robin island to stand __PUNCT__
after twenti __PUNCT__ seven year in prison at hard labor __PUNCT__ he invit them to share that dai __PUNCT__
he later told me that __PUNCT__ i knew if i didn't leav my bitter and hatr behind __PUNCT__ i still be in prison __PUNCT__
that the kind of love i talk about __PUNCT__
our faith call us to do what is hard __PUNCT__ to give voic to the voiceless __PUNCT__ to lift up the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick __PUNCT__
but for the past seven year __PUNCT__ our leader have gotten wrong __PUNCT__
thei gotten it upsid down and backward __PUNCT__
thei have given corpor tax break to wall street and then cut head start __PUNCT__ child care and drop out prevent __PUNCT__
thei have lift up the drug and insur compani __PUNCT__ but veto health care for million of children in need __PUNCT__
thei have given tax break to the oil compani but cut off home heat assist for our senior thi winter __PUNCT__
thei have wage a war in iraq that ha taken more than __NUM__ of our son and daughter __PUNCT__
but thei also regret the poverti __PUNCT__ the diseas and violenc that afflict our brother and sister here at home and around the world __PUNCT__
everi dai you perform good work root in the valu of our faith __PUNCT__
isn't it a shame when we have leader that talk a lot about valu __PUNCT__ but then go and do exactli the opposit in betray of those same valu __PUNCT__
it remind me of what the writer __PUNCT__ eli wiesel __PUNCT__ onc observ __PUNCT__ the opposit of love is not hate __PUNCT__ it is indiffer __PUNCT__
and for the past seven year __PUNCT__ that what we have seen in washington __PUNCT__ an epidem of indiffer __PUNCT__
a collect turn of our govern back on the least among us __PUNCT__
it is in everi wai possibl the opposit of love __PUNCT__
when our children attend school that ar separ and unequ in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ when anyon vote on a broken machin and their vote isn't count __PUNCT__ that is the opposit of love __PUNCT__
when we see noos hung in a school yard __PUNCT__ when the scream of selma and montgomeri ar cloud by the nightmar of katrina and rita __PUNCT__ that is the opposit of love __PUNCT__
when some member of god household have everi advantag while other ar shut out of the circl of opportun __PUNCT__ that is the opposit of love __PUNCT__
while we mai have an incom gap and a health gap __PUNCT__ and an achiev gap __PUNCT__ there is on thing we don't have __PUNCT__ a potenti gap __PUNCT__
it is time we gave everi singl child in thi countri the chanc to live up to hi or her god __PUNCT__ given abil and potenti __PUNCT__
that is what i have strive to do for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
with your help we will continu to make that real __PUNCT__
it is time to reach out and embrac those of the margin and in the shadow __PUNCT__
to usher them back to speech at the tabl in god household __PUNCT__
to ensur that their voic ar onc again heard in thi countri __PUNCT__
too mani of our fellow citizen feel invis __PUNCT__
thei come to up to me __PUNCT__ as a woman did todai in littl rock __PUNCT__ and said __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ what am i to do __PUNCT__ i can't get the cancer treatment for my chemotherapi anymor __PUNCT__ i can't afford it and thei won't pai for it __PUNCT__
it keep me aliv and now i don't know where to turn __PUNCT__
or the man who stop me the other dai in new york and said __PUNCT__ i about to lose my job __PUNCT__
i got two children to send to colleg __PUNCT__
where will i get the help __PUNCT__ peopl feel like their deepest concern __PUNCT__ their love of their famili __PUNCT__ can no longer ani matter to those in the highest posit of power __PUNCT__
scriptur tell us we cannot just be __PUNCT__ hearer __PUNCT__ of the word we must be __PUNCT__ doer __PUNCT__
we ar told that faith without work is dead __PUNCT__
i have live long enough by now to know that work without faith is just too hard __PUNCT__
if you cannot dip into that righteou stream and replenish your soul __PUNCT__ it is overwhelm __PUNCT__ isn't it __PUNCT__
as i look at the work yet to be finish __PUNCT__ i believ we ar all call upon to be both hearer and doer __PUNCT__
we ar call to face the inact __PUNCT__ to deliv real solut to the real problem that our peopl ar face __PUNCT__
that is the affirm of our love __PUNCT__
i often taught a sundai school class when i wa in arkansa __PUNCT__ and we talk and talk a lot about love on neighbor as oneself __PUNCT__
i wa struck by how absolut brilliant jesu wa __PUNCT__
we realli can't love someon if we don't love ourselv __PUNCT__ can we __PUNCT__
if we don't believ in and have respect for thi great gift we have been given __PUNCT__ it hard to reach out and love someon __PUNCT__ a neighbor __PUNCT__ a friend __PUNCT__
then of cours to be call upon to love on enemi seem total unrealist in the world we live in __PUNCT__
it hard enough get through the dai __PUNCT__
but it is what we ar call to do __PUNCT__
we have to put that call into action __PUNCT__ not onli in our individu live but throughout our societi __PUNCT__
let us think about the solut we can bring about __PUNCT__ to give our peopl hope __PUNCT__ but more than hope __PUNCT__ result __PUNCT__
the tangibl evid that thei ar no longer invis __PUNCT__ but that their need __PUNCT__ their hurt __PUNCT__ their want __PUNCT__ ar be tend to __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean expand the earn incom tax credit and ty the minimum wage to the congression wage so that congress cannot get a rais until the american peopl do __PUNCT__ especi those who do the hardest work __PUNCT__ everi dai __PUNCT__
i mean invest in clean renew energi and creat creat green collar job right here in atlanta and across america __PUNCT__
job that cannot be outsourc __PUNCT__ job that we can train our young peopl to do __PUNCT__ job that will move our depend on foreign oil and give us a chanc to give our economi __PUNCT__ our environ __PUNCT__ our secur onc again under america control __PUNCT__
i believ we need to make it abundantli clear that no on that work full time in america should bring home a wage that keep that person and hi famili below the poverti line __PUNCT__
anybodi will to work a fulltim job should have accommod of incom and benefit that lift them up __PUNCT__
that how we build a strong middl class __PUNCT__
when i sai solut i mean tuition tax credit __PUNCT__ to open the door of higher educ __PUNCT__ more grant __PUNCT__ more opportun for nation servic so that student can earn monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
when i sai solut __PUNCT__ i mean tax credit to open the door of higher educ __PUNCT__
more pell grant __PUNCT__ more opportun for nation servic so that student can earn monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
i mean doubl the fund for histor black colleg and univers like morehous and spelman and clark atlanta right here __PUNCT__
these have been a bridg to the middl class for gener of young peopl __PUNCT__
that bridg ha a sign on it __PUNCT__ you can not enter if you don't have the monei __PUNCT__
that isn't the wai it us to be __PUNCT__
some of us ar old enough to rememb as i am __PUNCT__
i got a loan from the feder govern when i went to law school __PUNCT__
it wa about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ interest so when i graduat i want to go work for the children defens fund and work for marian wright edelman __PUNCT__
i didn't want to go to work for a big law firm __PUNCT__
i want to defend the abus and neglect kid __PUNCT__ the kid in the foster care system __PUNCT__ the kid without health care and educ __PUNCT__
but if i had been graduat with ten of thousand of dollar worth of debt __PUNCT__ i not sure i could have done that __PUNCT__
we need also to offer to young peopl who graduat with debt the opportun to do a public servic job like teach or nurs or law enforc and let them pai off their loan over time so thei don't becom an indentur servant to these student loan compani that hold them in the thrall of predatori interest rate __PUNCT__
open the door of colleg is not onli good for the young peopl who walk across that bridg __PUNCT__ it is essenti for the futur of our countri __PUNCT__
when i sai solut i mean health care for everyon __PUNCT__ no except __PUNCT__ no excus __PUNCT__ everi man __PUNCT__ woman __PUNCT__ and child to have qualiti afford health care becaus that the onli wai we can close the infant mortal gap __PUNCT__ close the life expect cap __PUNCT__ ensur that peopl get the primari care from a doctor not from an emerg room __PUNCT__
when i sai solut i mean fix thi hous crisi becaus a hous is more than just your greatest sourc of wealth __PUNCT__
it the center of your famili __PUNCT__ it where you make memori and develop relationship __PUNCT__
no on should take that awai from you becaus of the subprim abus practic that so mani mortgag lender engag in without ani supervis or oversight from the feder govern __PUNCT__
we got to have a moratorium on home foreclosur for nineti dai so we can help peopl stai in their home __PUNCT__
and let freez those interest rate for five year so thei don't keep go up and forc more and more peopl into debt __PUNCT__ into foreclosur __PUNCT__
and let put a cap on the interest rate that credit card compani can charg and tell them thei got to start explain to peopl in big print __PUNCT__ not littl print __PUNCT__ what the term and condit ar __PUNCT__
no on should forc you into an ocean of debt becaus your health care cost ar go up __PUNCT__ your educ and energi cost ar go up __PUNCT__ but your wage aren't __PUNCT__
the averag american famili ha lost __MONEY__ in incom in the last seven year __PUNCT__
african american famili have lost __MONEY__
contrast that with what happen dure the nineti when the typic famili __PUNCT__ includ african american famili __PUNCT__ saw a rise of __MONEY__ in their incom and more peopl lift out of poverti than in ani time in our countri recent histori __PUNCT__
we know how to turn thi around but we have to come togeth to seek common ground wherev possibl and to stand our ground whenev necessari __PUNCT__
and if we truli love our brother and sister __PUNCT__ our son and daughter __PUNCT__ then we will end thi war in iraq that ha claim so mani of their live and injur ten of thousand of them __PUNCT__
and we will care for them when thei came home __PUNCT__ becaus i believ if you serv our countri __PUNCT__ our countri should serv you __PUNCT__
and you should get the health care __PUNCT__ the compens __PUNCT__ the job that you deserv __PUNCT__
everi dai in america hundr of thousand of our veteran ar homeless __PUNCT__ ar jobless __PUNCT__ ar be turn awai from treatment and health care becaus there no space for them __PUNCT__
i think we got to do everyth we can to make it clear that we will tend to our veteran start with our youngest veteran with a __NUM__ centuri g.i __PUNCT__
bill of right for monei for colleg __PUNCT__ and home ownership __PUNCT__ and a busi __PUNCT__ all the wai back to our oldest veteran __PUNCT__
let pai particular attent to the vietnam veteran who fought and serv dure that conflict who did not get the help and the servic that thei had earn __PUNCT__
and we will restor our moral leadership in the world to ensur that we never fight a war like thi again __PUNCT__
will all of thi be easi __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
will we get it done all at onc __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ but we will make our greatest effort __PUNCT__ just as all of you have done __PUNCT__
that is at the heart of what bring you togeth __PUNCT__ your work everi dai on the front line of our commun address some of our most difficult challeng __PUNCT__ poverti and hunger __PUNCT__ hiv/aid and diseas __PUNCT__ disast relief and so much more __PUNCT__
it is a role that your church have plai throughout our nation histori __PUNCT__
our church have serv as a bedrock of our commun __PUNCT__ a refug in time of need __PUNCT__ the heart of our great movement for justic __PUNCT__
you cannot have the right kind of chang without justic __PUNCT__
