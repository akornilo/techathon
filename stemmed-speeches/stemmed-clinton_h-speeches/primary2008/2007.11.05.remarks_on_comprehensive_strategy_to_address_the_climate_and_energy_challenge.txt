it is our stori becaus the climat crisi portend drastic chang to our wai of life __PUNCT__
the last two decad of the __NUM__ centuri were the hottest in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
the intergovernment panel on climat chang found that __NUM__ of the past __NUM__ year ar among the warmest sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__

beyond our shore __PUNCT__ you have african countri experienc water stress __PUNCT__ asian countri contend with increas flood __PUNCT__
it our stori becaus our depend on foreign oil threaten our economi __PUNCT__
america nation and econom secur ha taken a backseat to the driver seat __PUNCT__

two third of american now sai that rise ga price ar a hardship for their famili __PUNCT__

meanwhil __PUNCT__ we ar more depend on foreign oil todai than we were on 9/11 __PUNCT__
and on third of our trade deficit is the petroleum we import __PUNCT__ as we transfer massiv amount of wealth to undemocrat govern that us those fund to stifl opposit and financ extrem __PUNCT__

the presid took seven year to recogn climat chang __PUNCT__
he refus realli to engag in talk with other global leader at the unit nation and even tri to stop individu state from take their own action to reduc co2 emiss under the clean air act __PUNCT__
thi is the biggest challeng we have face in a gener __PUNCT__
it is a challeng to our economi __PUNCT__ to our secur __PUNCT__ to our health __PUNCT__ and to our planet __PUNCT__
and it time for america to meet it __PUNCT__
it is time to get back into the solut busi __PUNCT__
and that is what america doe better than anybodi els __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ when america confront a great depress __PUNCT__ we did not wring our hand __PUNCT__
we roll up our sleev __PUNCT__
try roll up your sleev while you wring your hand __PUNCT__
it can't be done __PUNCT__
and we creat the new deal and invent social secur __PUNCT__

while young men fought oversea __PUNCT__ american did their part to support the war effort here at home __PUNCT__
when the soviet union launch sputnik __PUNCT__ we didn't minim the challeng or silenc the scientist who want to get out and meet it __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ within on year __PUNCT__ presid eisenhow had creat the defens advanc research project agenc __PUNCT__ creat nasa __PUNCT__ and pass the nation defens educ act that foster the next gener of scientist and engin __PUNCT__
our nation wa so unit and determin that we answer presid kennedi call to land an american on the moon and return him safe to earth within the decad __PUNCT__
for thi gener of american __PUNCT__ climat chang is our space race __PUNCT__
it is our home __PUNCT__ front mobil dure world war ii and it is our respons to the great depress __PUNCT__
accord to studi __PUNCT__ the neg econom consequ of climat chang will affect everi part of our countri __PUNCT__ virtual everi sector of our economi __PUNCT__ and strain our local govern __PUNCT__ cost job __PUNCT__ and extract a horrif human toll __PUNCT__
i veri proud that vice presid gore and the intergovernment panel on climat chang just won the nobel peac prize for sound the alarm that all of us must respond to __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ there ar also secur implic __PUNCT__
a group of retir __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ star gener and admir issu a recent report describ in detail the threat that global warm pose to our nation secur __PUNCT__ from increas conflict over natur resourc to instabl and migrat __PUNCT__
earlier thi year __PUNCT__ the senat pass my legisl to requir the depart of defens to integr thi issu into our plan __PUNCT__
and for those who still believ that we can't afford to tackl climat chang __PUNCT__ the price of inact is far higher than the price of action __PUNCT__
i believ america is readi to take action __PUNCT__ to break the bond of the old energi economi __PUNCT__ to prove that the climat crisi is on of the great econom opportun in the histori of our countri __PUNCT__
seiz it will unleash a wave of innov __PUNCT__ creat million of new job __PUNCT__ enhanc our secur __PUNCT__ and lead the world in a revolut in how we produc and us energi __PUNCT__
it can liter be a new begin for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ after __NUM__ year of advocaci on behalf of children and famili __PUNCT__ i believ solv the climat and energi crisi is critic to leav our children a world as healthi and welcom as the on we inherit __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ after eight year in the white hous and seven year in the senat __PUNCT__ i believ i know how to get the job done __PUNCT__
i know that a true american respons offer us a wai not just to bridg the econom divid __PUNCT__ but to heal the partisan divid that ha paralyz our polit and compromis our futur __PUNCT__
there is someth for everyon to do __PUNCT__ and success will requir each of us do our part __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ if you readi for chang __PUNCT__ i am readi to lead __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will set three major energi goal for america __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ to reduc greenhous ga emiss __NUM__ percent from __NUM__ level by __NUM__ the amount necessari to avoid the most danger and destruct consequ of climat chang __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ two __PUNCT__ to cut foreign oil import by two third from project level by __NUM__ to move america toward energi independ __PUNCT__
and three __PUNCT__ to move us from a carbon __PUNCT__ base economi to an effici __PUNCT__ green economi by unleash a wave of privat __PUNCT__ sector innov in clean energi and energi effici __PUNCT__
i believ that will creat at least five million good new job from clean energi over the next decad __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ how will we achiev these goal __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will lead a nation commit to energi effici __PUNCT__
thi is the cheapest __PUNCT__ cleanest __PUNCT__ fastest wai to reduc energi consumpt and save energi cost __PUNCT__ and to creat good new job that cannot be outsourc __PUNCT__
the depart of energi estim that we can reduc energi us in residenti build __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we can do better than that i believ __PUNCT__
by some estim all the futur growth in energi demand in north america __PUNCT__ all of it __PUNCT__ could be met through invest in effici alon __PUNCT__
and we know how to do thi __PUNCT__
sinc __NUM__ three __PUNCT__ fourth of all new demand ha been met simpli by us energi more effici __PUNCT__
over the past three decad __PUNCT__ california ha held it electr us per person flat __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ there been no increas in electr us per person in the entir state of california for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
thei done it through practic step in conserv and effici __PUNCT__
dure the same __NUM__ year period __PUNCT__ energi demand in the rest of countri __PUNCT__ skyrocket by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
california flat __PUNCT__
we all gone up __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ did california get left behind __PUNCT__ did peopl flee california becaus it wa no longer a good place to live __PUNCT__ just the opposit __PUNCT__
it ha prosper __PUNCT__
a studi releas earlier thi year by the univers of california berkelei found that cut greenhous ga emiss to __NUM__ level by __NUM__ through further improv in effici __PUNCT__ could creat more than __NUM__ million new job in california alon __PUNCT__
and if american electr us had fallen at the same rate as california us __PUNCT__ our whole countri would be us __NUM__ __PUNCT__ less electr todai __PUNCT__
so when i presid __PUNCT__ increas energi effici quickli will be prioriti on __PUNCT__
we will set a goal of reduc electr demand __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we must chang the wai util make monei __PUNCT__
todai the incent ar backward __PUNCT__
the less we conserv __PUNCT__ the more carbon we emit __PUNCT__ the more monei util earn __PUNCT__
we chang that with energi effici target for util and incent for save power instead of gener more of it __PUNCT__
thi seemingli simpl chang __PUNCT__ call decoupl __PUNCT__ ha transform potenti becaus util ar in the best posit to help busi and famili make invest in effici __PUNCT__
fourteen state alreadi have some form of effici goal for util and more util ar embrac that as well __PUNCT__
decoupl permit a util to invest in effici __PUNCT__
duke power and other util have commit to go beyond that __PUNCT__
thei ar offer energi audit to all of their custom __PUNCT__
thei help their custom come up with plan to cut consumpt and to financ the implement over __NUM__ to __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ as if effici gain were mini __PUNCT__ power plant __PUNCT__
it work like thi __PUNCT__ the instal of solar power and cold resist glass and other improv cut your util bill __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the util pai the upfront cost of those improv and then a portion of the effici save goe to you to cut your bill __PUNCT__ and the other goe to the util to pai off the cost of the improv __PUNCT__
you get a lower util bill __PUNCT__ thei get more power with no more co2 emiss __PUNCT__
in the process a lot of job ar creat __PUNCT__ instal the new product __PUNCT__ manufactur __PUNCT__ distribut and sell __PUNCT__
the system is user friendli __PUNCT__ faster __PUNCT__ cheaper and more labor __PUNCT__ intens than build a new power plant __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl who build thing for a live __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ but if we don't keep build power plant __PUNCT__ we go to lose job __PUNCT__
it just the contrari __PUNCT__
if we build million of mini __PUNCT__ power plant we go to creat more job __PUNCT__
that what i want to see for us __PUNCT__
onc we have nationwid decoupl __PUNCT__ everi util should implement thi type of system and maxim effici befor build ani new power plant __PUNCT__
and that just the begin __PUNCT__
at your offic __PUNCT__ you probabl have a desktop comput __PUNCT__ a thousand time more power and half the price than comput avail __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
an i __PUNCT__ pod can hold more song than you can listen to in a month __PUNCT__
we can talk to anyon __PUNCT__ anywher __PUNCT__ at ani time us __NUM__ centuri inform technolog __PUNCT__ which ha transform our economi __PUNCT__
but all of thi depend on a power grid all but unchang in half a centuri __PUNCT__
it is time to start build a __NUM__ centuri grid __PUNCT__
right now the system run on auto __PUNCT__ pilot __PUNCT__
the onli connect between your home and the grid is the power you draw __PUNCT__
but what if we har all of the advanc in inform technolog __PUNCT__ imagin if you could time your air condition __PUNCT__ or your dishwash or you dryer to turn on when demand for power wa less and the cost lower __PUNCT__
imagin if you could charg your car in your garag at night __PUNCT__ and sell power back to the util when your car is park at work dure the hour of peak energi demand __PUNCT__
imagin if you could sell back the excess power you gener with solar panel on your roof __PUNCT__
imagin if the system could manag the stress on the grid continu __PUNCT__ cut peak demand to avoid brown out __PUNCT__ conserv power and save monei __PUNCT__
just a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ drop in peak demand would save __MONEY__ billion in energi cost over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can har thi technolog __PUNCT__
as presid i will fund ten __PUNCT__ smart grid citi __PUNCT__ provid smart grid tax incent to util and encourag state util commiss to provid incent as well __PUNCT__
we will also make applianc more effici __PUNCT__ save consum __MONEY__ billion between now and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
you know the epa success energi star program provid valuabl inform to consum about how to save energi and save monei by purchas more effici product __PUNCT__
let take it further and creat a climat star initi __PUNCT__ to provid consum with inform to compar the carbon footprint of product that thei bui __PUNCT__
we will also phase out the incandesc light bulb __PUNCT__ the technolog that thoma edison pioneer __PUNCT__
i think thoma edison would support thi idea __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ he probabl be there help us develop the replac __PUNCT__ from l.e.d. to compact fluoresc __PUNCT__
compact floresc bulb __PUNCT__ thei mai look funni __PUNCT__ thei us a quarter the amount of energi and last __NUM__ to __NUM__ time longer than the typic incandesc bulb __PUNCT__
if we move to compact fluoresc __PUNCT__ or other equal energi save altern __PUNCT__ we will cut our nation electr bill by more than __MONEY__ billion over just __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i also want to launch a green build fund to invest __MONEY__ billion per year into energi effici in public build like school __PUNCT__ polic station __PUNCT__ firehous __PUNCT__ and offic __PUNCT__
we help __NUM__ million low __PUNCT__ incom famili modern their home to be more energi effici __PUNCT__
build account for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of america carbon emiss __PUNCT__ and there ar so mani simpl __PUNCT__ cost effect step we can take to reduc heat bill __PUNCT__ light bill __PUNCT__ save taxpay __PUNCT__ monei __PUNCT__ and cut pollut __PUNCT__
in the process we can creat hundr of thousand of new job __PUNCT__
i will also creat a program call __PUNCT__ conni mae __PUNCT__ that stand for the carbon neutral mortgag associ __PUNCT__
thi is a great idea that vice presid gore ha champion __PUNCT__
the extra cost of thicker insul and effici window coat __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ ar often shun by builder and buyer look to save monei __PUNCT__ even though these green product actual pai for themselv in lower util bill __PUNCT__
conni mae will make it easier for famili to secur afford loan from privat lender to improv the effici in their own home __PUNCT__
it a win for the banker __PUNCT__ homebuy and the planet __PUNCT__
yesterdai night i wa at the great river medic center __PUNCT__
it in west burlington __PUNCT__ and i learn it is the most energi effici hospit in america __PUNCT__
thi is happen in iowa right now __PUNCT__
it just happen so rare and on such an individu basi that we don't realiz all of the benefit that we can get __PUNCT__
the great river medic center is power by the world largest lake __PUNCT__ coupl geotherm heat and cool system __PUNCT__
i thought that wa pretti neat __PUNCT__
right here in iowa __PUNCT__
the most energi effici hospit in america __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ the second piec of my agenda ask the nation govern to set the rule and lead the wai __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will put in place a market __PUNCT__ base cap and trade system to reduc carbon pollut __PUNCT__
here how it will work __PUNCT__ the feder govern auction permit for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the nation carbon dioxid emiss __PUNCT__
compani purchas those allow but thei can be trade __PUNCT__ borrow __PUNCT__ bank __PUNCT__ bought __PUNCT__ and sold __PUNCT__
the market will determin the cost of carbon pollut and compani will be reward for cut emiss __PUNCT__
in combin with effici __PUNCT__ fuel economi standard and other propos __PUNCT__ thi system will ensur we meet our goal of reduc our contribut to global warm below __NUM__ level by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we know thi can work __PUNCT__
it wa exactli what we did in the 1990 to reduc acid rain __PUNCT__ cut sulfur dioxid emiss by __NUM__ million ton below __NUM__ level __PUNCT__
while set down the rule __PUNCT__ the feder govern will also set an exampl __PUNCT__
all new feder build design after noon __DATE__ when i becom presid __PUNCT__ will have to be carbon neutral __PUNCT__ that is zero emiss __PUNCT__
no new feder build that don't meet that standard __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i will ask the depart of hous and urban develop to strengthen energi effici standard for public hous and develop model standard for all new construct __PUNCT__
and we will make energi effici a core mission for the govern servic administr __PUNCT__ which manag feder build __PUNCT__
i also want to help local govern go green __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ mayor have sign a pledg to cut their citi contribut to climat chang and meet the standard set by the kyoto protocol __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i will ask automak to plai a role __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ your car mai have a cd player __PUNCT__ a navig system and gp __PUNCT__
we have front and side impact airbag __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ lock brake __PUNCT__ technolog that sens tini chang in road condit __PUNCT__
henri ford would be dumbfound until he open the hood __PUNCT__
becaus he would recogn the intern combust engin underneath __PUNCT__
it is the same basic concept that he put in to the model t almost a centuri ago __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ that model t got better ga mileag than your typic suv doe todai __PUNCT__
we can't continu thi __PUNCT__
it time for a chang __PUNCT__
for two decad __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ fuel economi ha stagnat __PUNCT__
car and light truck account for 40%of the __NUM__ million barrel of oil consum everi dai in america __PUNCT__
i believ america should do what we do best __PUNCT__ lead the innov race __PUNCT__
imagin if over the past centuri __PUNCT__ we advanc as far in power our car as we have in keep our car safe __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will rais the fuel effici standard to __NUM__ mile per gallon by __NUM__ and __NUM__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that will save consum more than __MONEY__ billion dollar in fuel bill each year and save us __NUM__ million barrel of oil each dai __PUNCT__
but i not go to ask the auto compani to do it alon __PUNCT__
i want to be a partner __PUNCT__ a good partner __PUNCT__ to help them transit to a clean energi futur __PUNCT__
i provid __MONEY__ billion in __PUNCT__ green vehicl bond __PUNCT__ to help domest automak retool their older plant to manufactur new __PUNCT__ more effici car and truck __PUNCT__
we also got to invest more in new batteri __PUNCT__ transmiss and other technolog __PUNCT__
i will creat a tax credit to help auto maker cover the legaci health care and retir cost thei face __PUNCT__
next __PUNCT__ we acceler the product of plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__
these ar vehicl that can be fill up at the ga station and charg up in a standard outlet __PUNCT__
a vehicl power by electr releas on __PUNCT__ third less global warm pollut __PUNCT__ even if the electr come from coal __PUNCT__
these car can offer the promis of __NUM__ mile to the gallon __PUNCT__
and if the plug __PUNCT__ in is a flex __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl run on e85 ethanol __PUNCT__ it could potenti travel __NUM__ mile for everi gallon of ga consum __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ the good new is __PUNCT__ detroit is alreadi embrac thi exist technolog __PUNCT__
it is pois to be a world leader __PUNCT__
gener motor plan to bring a plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid to market in __NUM__ and ford is look at plug __PUNCT__ in as well __PUNCT__
but the plug __PUNCT__ in revolut can't happen fast enough __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion in research and develop to reduc the cost __PUNCT__ improv the capac and the lifespan of lithium __PUNCT__ ion batteri __PUNCT__
i will offer consum a tax credit of up to __MONEY__ for purchas a plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__
and i want to add __NUM__ plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid to the feder fleet by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we got to increas access to public transport __PUNCT__
for everi mile you travel on a subwai __PUNCT__ a bu or a train instead of in a car __PUNCT__ you produc __NUM__ __PUNCT__ less carbon monoxid and half as much carbon dioxid __PUNCT__
if we have clean buse __PUNCT__ more effici locomot __PUNCT__ the reduct could even be greater __PUNCT__
i want to increas fund for public transit by more than __MONEY__ billion each year and link that to smart polici that discourag sprawl and congest __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we ask the oil compani to do their part __PUNCT__
i have propos a __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund to invest in the clean energi technolog of the futur __PUNCT__
here how we pai for it __PUNCT__ by end the tax break that oil compani receiv to maintain the exist oil depend economi __PUNCT__

we cannot let the middl class pai twice to solv the energi crisi __PUNCT__ in higher price at the pump and in bear the largest burden of transit to a green economi __PUNCT__
a portion of the oil compani __PUNCT__ profit should also be us to spark the r&d that will help america the world leader in export that technolog __PUNCT__
i will also requir oil compani and other major gasolin retail to instal e85 pump at half of their station in the next five year and all of their station in ten __PUNCT__
