dure those forti year __PUNCT__ our countri ha vote ten time for presid __PUNCT__
democrat won onli three of those time __PUNCT__
and the man who won two of those elect is with us todai __PUNCT__
we made tremend progress dure the 90 under a democrat presid __PUNCT__ with a flourish economi __PUNCT__ and our leadership for peac and secur respect around the world __PUNCT__
just think how much more progress we could have made over the past __NUM__ year if we had a democrat presid __PUNCT__
think about the lost opportun of these past seven year __PUNCT__ on the environ and the economi __PUNCT__ on health care and civil right __PUNCT__ on educ __PUNCT__ foreign polici and the suprem court __PUNCT__
imagin how far we could come __PUNCT__ how much we could achiev if we had just had a democrat in the white hous __PUNCT__
we cannot let thi moment slip awai __PUNCT__
we have come too far and accomplish too much __PUNCT__
now the journei ahead will not be easi __PUNCT__
some will sai we can't do it __PUNCT__
that it too hard __PUNCT__
that we just not up to the task __PUNCT__
but for as long as america ha exist __PUNCT__ it ha been the american wai to reject __PUNCT__ can't do __PUNCT__ claim __PUNCT__ and to choos instead to stretch the boundari of the possibl through hard work __PUNCT__ determin __PUNCT__ and a pioneer spirit __PUNCT__
it is thi belief __PUNCT__ thi optim __PUNCT__ that senat obama and i share __PUNCT__ and that ha inspir so mani million of our support to make their voic heard __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ i am stand with senat obama to sai __PUNCT__ ye we can __PUNCT__
togeth we will work __PUNCT__
we have to work hard to get univers health care __PUNCT__
but on the dai we live in an america where no child __PUNCT__ no man __PUNCT__ and no woman is without health insur __PUNCT__ we will live in a stronger america __PUNCT__
that why we need to help elect barack obama our presid __PUNCT__
we have to work hard to get back to fiscal respons and a strong middl class __PUNCT__
but on the dai we live in an america whose middl class is thrive and grow again __PUNCT__ where all american __PUNCT__ no matter where thei live or where their ancestor came from __PUNCT__ can earn a decent live __PUNCT__ we will live in a stronger america and that is why we must elect barack obama our presid __PUNCT__
we have to work hard to foster the innov that make us energi independ and lift the threat of global warm from our children futur __PUNCT__
but on the dai we live in an america fuel by renew energi __PUNCT__ we will live in a stronger america __PUNCT__
that why we have to help elect barack obama our presid __PUNCT__
we have to work hard to bring our troop home from iraq __PUNCT__ and get them the support thei earn by their servic __PUNCT__
but on the dai we live in an america that as loyal to our troop as thei have been to us __PUNCT__ we will live in a stronger america and that is why we must help elect barack obama our presid __PUNCT__
thi elect is a turn point elect and it is critic that we all understand what our choic realli is __PUNCT__
will we go forward togeth or will we stall and slip backward __PUNCT__
think how much progress we have alreadi made __PUNCT__
when we first start __PUNCT__ peopl everywher ask the same question __PUNCT__ could a woman realli serv as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we answer that on __PUNCT__
and could an african american realli be our presid __PUNCT__ senat obama ha answer that on __PUNCT__
togeth senat obama and i achiev mileston essenti to our progress as a nation __PUNCT__ part of our perpetu duti to form a more perfect union __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on a person note __PUNCT__ when i wa ask what it mean to be a woman run for presid __PUNCT__ i alwai gave the same answer __PUNCT__ that i wa proud to be run as a woman but i wa run becaus i thought i be the best presid __PUNCT__
but i am a woman __PUNCT__ and like million of women __PUNCT__ i know there ar still barrier and bias out there __PUNCT__ often unconsci __PUNCT__
i want to build an america that respect and embrac the potenti of everi last on of us __PUNCT__
i ran as a daughter who benefit from opportun my mother never dream of __PUNCT__
i ran as a mother who worri about my daughter futur and a mother who want to lead all children to brighter tomorrow __PUNCT__
to build that futur i see __PUNCT__ we must make sure that women and men alik understand the struggl of their grandmoth and mother __PUNCT__ and that women enjoi equal opportun __PUNCT__ equal pai __PUNCT__ and equal respect __PUNCT__
let us resolv and work toward achiev some veri simpl proposit __PUNCT__ there ar no accept limit and there ar no accept prejudic in the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri __PUNCT__
you can be so proud that __PUNCT__ from now on __PUNCT__ it will be unremark for a woman to win primari state victori __PUNCT__ unremark to have a woman in a close race to be our nomine __PUNCT__ unremark to think that a woman can be the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and that is truli remark __PUNCT__
to those who ar disappoint that we couldn't go all the wai __PUNCT__ especi the young peopl who put so much into thi campaign __PUNCT__ it would break my heart if __PUNCT__ in fall short of my goal __PUNCT__ i in ani wai discourag ani of you from pursu your __PUNCT__
alwai aim high __PUNCT__ work hard __PUNCT__ and care deepli about what you believ in __PUNCT__
when you stumbl __PUNCT__ keep faith __PUNCT__
when you knock down __PUNCT__ get right back up __PUNCT__
and never listen to anyon who sai you can't or shouldn't go on __PUNCT__
as we gather here todai in thi histor magnific build __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ woman to leav thi earth is orbit overhead __PUNCT__
if we can blast __NUM__ women into space __PUNCT__ we will somedai launch a woman into the white hous __PUNCT__
although we weren't abl to shatter that highest __PUNCT__ hardest glass ceil thi time __PUNCT__ thank to you __PUNCT__ it got about __NUM__ million crack in it __PUNCT__
and the light is shine through like never befor __PUNCT__ fill us all with the hope and the sure knowledg that the path will be a littl easier next time __PUNCT__
that ha alwai been the histori of progress in america __PUNCT__
think of the suffragist who gather at seneca fall in __NUM__ and those who kept fight until women could cast their vote __PUNCT__
think of the abolitionist who struggl and di to see the end of slaveri __PUNCT__
think of the civil right hero and foot __PUNCT__ soldier who march __PUNCT__ protest and risk their live to bring about the end to segreg and jim crow __PUNCT__
becaus of them __PUNCT__ i grew up take for grant that women could vote __PUNCT__
becaus of them __PUNCT__ my daughter grew up take for grant that children of all color could go to school togeth __PUNCT__
becaus of them __PUNCT__ barack obama and i could wage a hard fought campaign for the democrat nomin __PUNCT__
becaus of them __PUNCT__ and becaus of you __PUNCT__ children todai will grow up take for grant that an african american or a woman can ye __PUNCT__ becom presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
when that dai arriv and a woman take the oath of offic as our presid __PUNCT__ we will all stand taller __PUNCT__ proud of the valu of our nation __PUNCT__ proud that everi littl girl can dream and that her dream can come true in america __PUNCT__
and all of you will know that becaus of your passion and hard work you help pave the wai for that dai __PUNCT__
