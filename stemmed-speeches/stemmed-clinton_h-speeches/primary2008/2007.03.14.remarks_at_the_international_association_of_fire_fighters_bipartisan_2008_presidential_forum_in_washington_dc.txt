you know __PUNCT__ we were rais to believ that if you work hard and if you plai by rule you be abl to build a better life for yourself and your famili __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think in the last six year our countri ha actual been live up to that basic bargain __PUNCT__
the leadership here in washington seem to ignor middl class and hardwork famili across our countri __PUNCT__
under thi presid leadership household debt ha soar __PUNCT__ healthcar cost have skyrocket __PUNCT__ assum that you have it __PUNCT__
wage have remain stagnant __PUNCT__
now corpor profit ar up __PUNCT__
and product is up __PUNCT__ which mean american ar work harder than anybodi in the world __PUNCT__ but we not get reward __PUNCT__
i tell you who is get reward __PUNCT__
compani like halliburton ar get reward with no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ then thei move their ceo across the ocean to anoth countri and leav us hang right here at home __PUNCT__
i tell you someth els that we ar go to have to deal with __PUNCT__ the altern minimum tax __PUNCT__ which fall heavili on a lot of you and your famili __PUNCT__

to him __PUNCT__ thei invis __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ if you a child sit in a crumbl school __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you a small busi owner who worri about energi cost or someon who can't afford to fill up your tank __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__

and i want to sai in thi public set that when i in the white hous i go to be there for you whenev you need me on whatev you need me for __PUNCT__
becaus there isn't anyth more import to me than take care of our first respond __PUNCT__
it is part of our nation secur __PUNCT__ it is part of our moral oblig __PUNCT__
and be there for you mean continu the fight to ensur that you have everyth you need to do your job __PUNCT__ the equip __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__ whatev it take __PUNCT__
so let me tell you when georg w __PUNCT__ bush tri to cut the fund for the safer act __PUNCT__ which i co __PUNCT__ sponsor __PUNCT__ and the fire act __PUNCT__ i took that person __PUNCT__
and with my colleagu __PUNCT__ we fought him __PUNCT__

now be there for you also mean care for everi firefight __PUNCT__ everi polic offic __PUNCT__ everi paramed __PUNCT__ everi volunt or worker who ha fallen ill in the aftermath of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
it wasn't just peopl from new york who respond that dai and the dai to follow and the month to follow __PUNCT__
it wa peopl from all over our countri __PUNCT__ and when i first visit the site __PUNCT__ the afternoon of __DATE__ the __NUM__ i could bare see anyth __PUNCT__ the dark cloud wa so thick __PUNCT__
but i could smell it __PUNCT__ i could tast it __PUNCT__ i could feel it __PUNCT__
as i watch the first firefight walk out of that curtain of dark __PUNCT__ cover in black soot __PUNCT__ bare abl to stand __PUNCT__ drag their ax behind them __PUNCT__ i knew that the effect of 9/11 would last long after __DATE__ __PUNCT__
within dai the so call world trade center cough began to appear __PUNCT__
young men and women in the prime of their live develop asthma and bronchiti and laryng __PUNCT__ and their liver were pollut and their lung were fail __PUNCT__
and peopl who __PUNCT__ befor __DATE__ could lift three time their bodi weight __PUNCT__ could bare stand thei were so bent over in pain __PUNCT__
thei couldn't sleep ly flat in their bed anymor __PUNCT__ thei had to sit up all night long __PUNCT__
peopl who us to be abl to run mile without stop could no longer breath go up a flight of stair __PUNCT__
work hand in hand with mani of you and with the iaff we creat a program to screen and monitor those who were sick __PUNCT__
and we got __MONEY__ million to expand it __PUNCT__
and when presid bush tri to take __MONEY__ million back __PUNCT__ we knew we had to draw the line __PUNCT__
and you onc again came in and help us win that fight __PUNCT__
let just sai the presid pick a fight with the wrong peopl __PUNCT__
we won it but we didn't stop there __PUNCT__
with your help i wa abl to introduc legisl ask for more than __MONEY__ billion for medic and mental health monitor and treatment __PUNCT__
we go to keep work on thi __PUNCT__ not just thi year or next year but as long as our first respond __PUNCT__ our worker __PUNCT__ our volunt __PUNCT__ our resid need help __PUNCT__
be there for you also mean get smart about homeland secur __PUNCT__
as you know all too well __PUNCT__ we confront a new enemi and a new kind of warfar __PUNCT__
it realli the warfar of coward __PUNCT__
it peopl who sneak around and blow themselv up or place bomb in car __PUNCT__ who have a philosophi of nihil __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thei mai dress it up in a kind of pervers version of religion __PUNCT__ but it realli about destruct and death __PUNCT__
and it is imper that we stand against them __PUNCT__
their warfar is not conduct by armi or navi but by crimin __PUNCT__ by insurg __PUNCT__ by militia driven by thi twist hate __PUNCT__
and it been frustrat for mani of us becaus we can't get the resourc to match the rhetor __PUNCT__
we got a lot of tough rhetor out of washington __PUNCT__ but when it come to pai overtim __PUNCT__ get you the equip you need not the equip thei want to give you __PUNCT__ provid the monei directli to local commun and not pass it through the state __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we haven't gotten what we know you need to protect our countri __PUNCT__
and in thi latest budget __PUNCT__ the presid is propos to cut fund for first respond at the depart of homeland secur to the tune of __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
the wai i see it __PUNCT__ sai you believ in homeland secur without fund first respond is like sai you believ in build a hospit without doctor and nurs __PUNCT__
if we don't fund you __PUNCT__ we not fund our first line of defens __PUNCT__ and we go to need to work togeth to make that happen __PUNCT__
and as harold know __PUNCT__ and all my folk from new york know __PUNCT__ we have been fight for interoper commun sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we have put in legisl __PUNCT__
we ask for more monei __PUNCT__ but when firefight can't talk to polic offic __PUNCT__ when emerg respond can't talk to those form anoth __PUNCT__ we not onli saw it on __DATE__ we saw it again dure hurrican katrina __PUNCT__
a crisi that realli __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ put firefight in the forefront __PUNCT__
just think about what happen where your brother and sister ar try to oper out of trailer __PUNCT__ and thei still us ruin equip that we still haven't replac __PUNCT__
what wa a natur disast wa turn into a nation disgrac __PUNCT__ and we need to get the fund directli where thei ar need __PUNCT__
and be there for you mean try to end the war in iraq in the right wai __PUNCT__ becaus firefight have fought and di in iraq __PUNCT__
and we were heartbroken to learn that those who had fought and had been injur were languish in walter reed __PUNCT__
i went out there a week ago fridai earli in the morn to meet with a bunch of soldier from new york __PUNCT__
some of them had been ti up in the bureaucrat red tape until thei were just beyond word __PUNCT__
thei couldn't figur out __PUNCT__ what had i done to deserv thi __PUNCT__ i serv my countri __PUNCT__ activ duti __PUNCT__ nation guard __PUNCT__ or reserv __PUNCT__
why am i be treat like that __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ elect sent a strong messag that we do not want our young men and women in uniform to be in the middl of a sectarian civil war __PUNCT__ where thei don't know who is shoot at them __PUNCT__ and thei can figur out whose side thei suppos to be on __PUNCT__
we try to introduc some ration in thi __PUNCT__ in the congress __PUNCT__ try to stop the escal becaus i profoundli believ that put more of our young men and women into harm wai __PUNCT__ unless the iraqi decid to defend themselv __PUNCT__ we cannot end thi war for them __PUNCT__
if thei not go to stand up and take respons __PUNCT__ we should not lose anoth american life __PUNCT__
we should end thi escal now __PUNCT__
i hope that the presid will extric us from iraq befor he leav offic __PUNCT__
but let me assur you __PUNCT__ if you doesn't __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__
be there for you mean stand side by side with you in the fight for your most fundament right __PUNCT__
as harold said in hi introduct __PUNCT__ i believ that it is absolut essenti to the wai america work that peopl be given the right to organ and bargain collect __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ when __NUM__ deleg gather for the first iaff convent __PUNCT__ __NUM__ hour work __PUNCT__ week were the norm __PUNCT__ and terribl condit were a fact of life __PUNCT__
you know why that no longer the case __PUNCT__ becaus of you __PUNCT__
you organ __PUNCT__ you union __PUNCT__ you stood up for your right __PUNCT__
you said __PUNCT__ we not go to be invis __PUNCT__
we do our part __PUNCT__
you have to give us safe work condit __PUNCT__ fair treatment __PUNCT__ and the right to bargain __PUNCT__
but some peopl still don't get it __PUNCT__
you know thei sai that collect bargain will undermin our nation secur __PUNCT__
thei think you haven't earn the right to organ __PUNCT__
you know what i sai to them __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__ would you chang place __PUNCT__ would you go into that fire __PUNCT__ would you stand on those collaps floor and under those crumbl ceil __PUNCT__ well the wai i see it __PUNCT__ when you plung head first into burn build for a live __PUNCT__ you have more than earn the right to organ for better condit on the job __PUNCT__
make no mistak about it __PUNCT__ the dai of georg bush think the union bug is someth he need to squash ar over __PUNCT__
we ar here to stand up for the right of peopl who pull children out of rage water and rescu peopl from flame rooftop __PUNCT__
we ar here to stand up for the peopl who stand up for us __PUNCT__
we have a lot of work head of us __PUNCT__ and we could get some small victori along the wai until we final get the major we need to complet have an agenda that we support in the senat __PUNCT__
thei can still stop a lot of what we believ in __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ but we just have to keep elect more peopl who see the world the wai we do __PUNCT__
and we certainli will make a lot more progress when we take back the white hous __PUNCT__
back after the dai of __DATE__ so mani of you came to me and said that the famili of firefight who had been kill were confront pile of paperwork just to get the benefit thei were ow __PUNCT__
thei were told it would take week or month __PUNCT__ and the famili didn't have that kind of time __PUNCT__
so again __PUNCT__ work with harold and hi team __PUNCT__ we put togeth a bill __PUNCT__ and my friend jerri nadler sponsor it in the hous __PUNCT__ and within a week that bill pass into law __PUNCT__
and when the bill pass __PUNCT__ we didn't declar victori or do some kind of big celebr __PUNCT__ becaus the truth is __PUNCT__ in the end __PUNCT__ there wa noth we could do to give back to those famili the peopl thei had love and lost __PUNCT__
all we could do is to come togeth as a team and help as best we could __PUNCT__
and in the end __PUNCT__ we just follow the basic rule you live by __PUNCT__ you never leav a brother or sister behind __PUNCT__
well that how i tri to serv in the senat __PUNCT__
that how i tri to set my prioriti __PUNCT__ and i want you to know that __PUNCT__ if i do have the honor and the opportun to be your presid __PUNCT__ that what i will continu to do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ peopl who know me will tell you i don't back down from a fight __PUNCT__
and other us more color languag sometim about me __PUNCT__
but that just fine with me __PUNCT__
i don't care what thei sai __PUNCT__ i just care about what we do __PUNCT__

i know that if we stand togeth __PUNCT__ we get our messag out to america __PUNCT__
if we steel ourselv to all of the critic and the counter __PUNCT__ attack and the stereotyp and everyth that thei put out __PUNCT__ then we be victori __PUNCT__
i have a littl experi at stai the cours and in stick with peopl who stick with me __PUNCT__
st __PUNCT__ augustin said a long time ago that hope is realli the combin of two thing __PUNCT__
it a combin of anger at the wai thing ar and courag to chang the wai thing ar __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ live by hope and understand __PUNCT__ we can't be satisfi by what we see befor us on homeland secur or collect bargain __PUNCT__
