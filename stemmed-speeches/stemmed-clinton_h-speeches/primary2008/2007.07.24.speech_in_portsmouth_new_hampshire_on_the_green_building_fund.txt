i want to thank howard __PUNCT__ and john tabor __PUNCT__ and everyon associ with seacoast media group __PUNCT__
thi is a wonder idea and a beauti facil for all of us to meet talk about issu __PUNCT__
and i am delight that the candid have been invit to come and address you and to answer your question about some of the realli signific challeng we face as a countri __PUNCT__
the seacoast here in new hampshir is a perfect place for thi convers __PUNCT__
you have mani differ form of energi within a veri short distanc from where we ar right now __PUNCT__ nuclear __PUNCT__ coal __PUNCT__ oil __PUNCT__ wood __PUNCT__
you got peopl who ar work on har the power of the tide __PUNCT__
you got wind __PUNCT__
you have some veri excit local initi that you undertaken by town across new hampshir __PUNCT__
and certainli here in portsmouth __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__ what you done to make a real commit to cleaner energi __PUNCT__ more energi effici build __PUNCT__ and the lead design that you got for the librari __PUNCT__
all of that is realli demonstr so strongli how import it is that local commun be a part of the solut __PUNCT__
there a lot of evid __PUNCT__ as howard also talk about __PUNCT__ that new hampshir suffer from the failur of the nation govern to do what we should be do with respect to energi and global warm __PUNCT__
and in veri specif term the impact of pollut __PUNCT__ ozon __PUNCT__ smog __PUNCT__ particul __PUNCT__ mercuri that come and deposit themselv on new hampshir even though thei ar not produc in thi state __PUNCT__
when we talk about what we need to do at the feder level __PUNCT__ and what i want to do as presid __PUNCT__ deal with our twin problem of improv our energi system by becom more independ __PUNCT__ therefor __PUNCT__ more secur and more effici __PUNCT__
it is also a wai we will approach global warm __PUNCT__ which will begin to deal with greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__
both of those effort will have an impact on the qualiti of the environ and begin to reduc some of the damag that is done by the power plant far awai from here that drop acid rain and other kind of pollut onto you as it doe the adirondack and the hudson river in new york __PUNCT__
i done a lot of work on that __PUNCT__
so thi is an interrel issu __PUNCT__ and i think it import that we consid it in that wai __PUNCT__
becaus all too often we talk about energi __PUNCT__ we have a kind of stovepip discuss about that __PUNCT__
then we talk about global warm or climat chang and we talk about that __PUNCT__
and then i also like to talk about the health impact from the environ becaus i think that anoth issu that ha to be relat __PUNCT__
so what i want to do in __NUM__ minut or so and then get to your question is talk a littl bit about what i like to do to address all these issu __PUNCT__
and some of it ha to come from the feder govern __PUNCT__ but some of it ha to be thi partnership that you ar so clearli pursu at the state and local level __PUNCT__
but then we also have to address what we can do as individu __PUNCT__
in our home __PUNCT__ and our busi __PUNCT__ our drive habit __PUNCT__ and everyth els __PUNCT__ becaus we have to have a unit front in order to address energi and global warm and environment health __PUNCT__
let me sai __PUNCT__ about energi __PUNCT__ we all know that we ar depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
we know that about a third of our trade deficit come from the fact that we have an insati appetit for foreign oil __PUNCT__
we ar us more monei than we were befor 9/11 __PUNCT__
and much of the monei that we spend import and us thi foreign oil goe to regim that ar unfriendli to mani of our __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we have to address our depend on foreign oil as a secur issu __PUNCT__
and it not that these regim ar unstabl and unfriendli __PUNCT__
but there is on area in saudi arabia where __NUM__ out of everi __NUM__ gallon of gasolin is produc __PUNCT__
if there were an accid or an attack on that site __PUNCT__ it would throw the global economi into a tailspin __PUNCT__
thi is an imper and frankli __PUNCT__ we have been unwil to face up to thi for a number of reason __PUNCT__
among them ar the great power of the oil compani and ga compani __PUNCT__ the influenc thei have in washington __PUNCT__
the fact that after the first oil shock in the 1970 when opec came into exist and us their power as a cartel to realli squeez oil suppli and rais demand and price __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we all stood in line and wait to get our car fill up __PUNCT__
i can rememb that __PUNCT__ get to a ga station at __NUM__ o'clock in the morn __PUNCT__ rememb __PUNCT__ we were all determin to do someth about it __PUNCT__
and to jimmi carter credit __PUNCT__ he did try __PUNCT__ he put into effect a number of provis that were at least aim at wean us off foreign oil __PUNCT__ make us more energi consciou and effici __PUNCT__
and then the price of ga fell __PUNCT__ becaus rememb it can be manipul __PUNCT__ anybodi who tell you it just market suppli is naiv __PUNCT__
it can be manipul and it ha been __PUNCT__
the price of ga drop __PUNCT__ so we all go __PUNCT__ oh good __PUNCT__ back to low ga price __PUNCT__
polit pressur off __PUNCT__ we back to look for realli low ga price __PUNCT__
my late father __PUNCT__ we would drive __NUM__ mile to bui ga __PUNCT__ in a ga war __PUNCT__ you know you have two ga station on on each side of the street __PUNCT__ on would be at __NUM__ cent the other would be at __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we had that mental __PUNCT__ that how we grew up that somehow there wa an inexhaust suppli that could carri us anywher we cant in our automobil __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ presid reagan came in __PUNCT__ total elimin all the energi effici and conserv and technolog research program that presid carter put in and as citizen __PUNCT__ that wa fine with us __PUNCT__ we were back to cheap ga price __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ two place didn't do that __PUNCT__
brazil said __PUNCT__ we don't want to be depend of foreign oil __PUNCT__
and thei began a long __PUNCT__ term research project with led to their us of ethanol from sugar cane __PUNCT__ which thei produc in great quantiti __PUNCT__
thei ar e practic independ from import foreign oil now __PUNCT__ becaus thei didn't give up __PUNCT__
polit wind blew and chang but thei kept on thi research project __PUNCT__
california did not chang their energi conserv law __PUNCT__
thei kept stress energi conserv and in fact __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ in california __PUNCT__ the per capita usag of electr in california ha remain constant __PUNCT__
wherea it ha gone __NUM__ percent in the rest of the countri becaus we didn't have law and we didn't have public inform campaign __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
sometim __PUNCT__ when i talk about get off of foreign oil and becom more effici and conserv mind __PUNCT__ somebodi who ha been brainwash by the republican and the oil compani sai __PUNCT__ we can't do that __PUNCT__ we ruin the economi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the fact is __PUNCT__ brazil did it and california ha done and these ar just tow thing we can do if we ar seriou about our oil secur __PUNCT__
when it come to conserv and energi effici __PUNCT__ you have a program that we ar all familiar with __PUNCT__ if you live in cold state like new hampshir and new york and elsewher is the weather program __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it send out peopl to actual weather home __PUNCT__ to make them more energi effici __PUNCT__
out of the weather program we creat about __NUM__ job around the countri __PUNCT__
you can creat about __NUM__ job in everi million dollar you invest in energi effici __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we have __NUM__ job from do what make sens __PUNCT__ weather peopl home __PUNCT__ help them save monei __PUNCT__
becaus we know that low incom peopl __PUNCT__ peopl that should be elig for liheap but do not alwai get the monei becaus it keep be cut __PUNCT__
on in three forgo medic or dental servic for energi reason __PUNCT__
thei have to pai heat or cool in come part of the countri __PUNCT__
and on in four forgo rent or mortgag assist or thei pai forgo for the heat and pai their mortgag instead __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we know that we can make progress in thi area if we ar smart about it and creat new good job __PUNCT__
todai i announc anoth on o my plan __PUNCT__ in deal with thi and that is to creat a fund call the green build fund __PUNCT__ __NUM__ billion dollar a year that will be given in grant to state and local to help make build more effici and by the wai __PUNCT__ put __NUM__ peopl to work __PUNCT__
so we know that we can creat million of job if we ar smart about how we go about deal with energi and global warm and the build fund would be on exampl that is veri specif about how we would do that __PUNCT__
the other part of my energi secur plan would be to creat a __NUM__ billion dollar fund __PUNCT__
the model for thi come from thing we alreadi done __PUNCT__ the apollo program __PUNCT__ the manhattan program that we were so good at as american __PUNCT__
we would see our challeng and would go about meet them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ energi secur and global warm ar the two greatest technic challeng we confront __PUNCT__ just like send a man to the moon or build an atom bomb were in the earlier gener __PUNCT__
and so what i am propos is the strateg energi fund that would be fund with __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
ten billion dollar would come from the oil compani pai royalti on drill on public land __PUNCT__
thei have escap from pai their fair share __PUNCT__
public land ar just that and thei need to be pai more __PUNCT__
__NUM__ billion would come from remov the tax subsidi that have been increas under the bush administr __PUNCT__ remov the tax subsidi from the oil compani __PUNCT__ thei don't need it thei been make more monei than anyon ha ever made in the histori of the world and that __NUM__ billion will go into these strateg energi fund __PUNCT__
the remain __NUM__ billion would come from a deal that i will offer the oil compani __PUNCT__ here the deal __PUNCT__
you all have been hear how the oil refineri ar just all be shut down __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ ga is more than __NUM__ dollar a gallon here on the seacoast and everi time you turn around __PUNCT__ you red about a refineri that had to shut down becaus it had a mechan problem or it had some other kind of difficulti __PUNCT__
it just alwai intrigu to me that refineri shut down in the summer __PUNCT__
it doesn't sound like a coincid to me __PUNCT__
and then the oil compani come back and sai thei don't have enough refineri capac and the oil compani argu with you when you tell them that you want low sulfur diesel and we want the summer blend of ga and it all too complic __PUNCT__ appar __PUNCT__ for these enorm corpor to figur out __PUNCT__
so here the deal __PUNCT__
thei can either invest the remain __NUM__ billion dollar themselv in altern technolog __PUNCT__ thei can build clean __PUNCT__ better refineri that will not break down all the time __PUNCT__ thei can take step that will actual put them on the side of help them to solv both our energi secur issu and our global warm issu or we will tax their windfal profit __PUNCT__
we will take an averag of their profit between __NUM__ and __NUM__ whenev we get thi pass and we will tae __NUM__ percent abov that level __PUNCT__
there will be all kind of crocodil tear and i can hear the gui on cabl tv sai i go after the oil compani __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i am go after the oil compani __PUNCT__
and with good reason __PUNCT__
thei ar a huge part of the problem we have and thei refus to be a part of the solut __PUNCT__
and thei have had a friend in the whit hous name dick chenei who ha protect them and help them to profit so enorm __PUNCT__
it is time for them to start contribut to america again __PUNCT__
the third thing is __PUNCT__ as we go forward on thi __PUNCT__ we got to have feder legisl explicitli to deal with global warm __PUNCT__
becaus what will be done with the strateg energi fund that i just said __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__
we start with the __NUM__ or __NUM__ that we start with and go forward but we need to be put all the technolog that ar possibl out there for us on a veri fast track __PUNCT__
we need the veri best mind in america __PUNCT__ get our univers get our privat sector laboratori get our govern scientist all on the same page __PUNCT__
instead of have a presid who will not utter the word global warm __PUNCT__ we will have a global warm agenda __PUNCT__
and we will also make it clear that as we move forward we want everi american to particip __PUNCT__ we want the best idea __PUNCT__
it is excit to me that we could unleash a whole new era of innov __PUNCT__ let call it energi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ let be as creativ with thi as we were with inform technolog __PUNCT__
it is exactli what i think will help tot spur american competit and put million of american to work __PUNCT__
i have sign on to the most aggress cap and trade global warm bill that we have __PUNCT__
senat boxer chair who the environ committe on which i serv __PUNCT__
senat sander __PUNCT__ your neighbor from vermont __PUNCT__
have put forward a plan for an economi wide cap and trade system aim at lower greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ percent below the __NUM__ level __PUNCT__
we will try to get the to __NUM__ level by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i know these ar aggress target __PUNCT__
but i think that we have to set aggress target and set big goal to unleash the geniu of the american economi __PUNCT__
if you think about the internet __PUNCT__ it wa realli a combin of govern research __PUNCT__ start in the 1950 after sputnik went up with someth call the darpa __PUNCT__ we put billion dollar in __PUNCT__ over time __PUNCT__ help to spur the space program __PUNCT__ but that is also where the internet start __PUNCT__
and peopl __PUNCT__ liter __PUNCT__ invent in their garag and come up with amaz idea __PUNCT__ be taken to market __PUNCT__
so we now have what we see in the world todai __PUNCT__
the world wide net and all the advanc we have __PUNCT__
i not sure we even know todai __PUNCT__ what form of energi we know we could be us in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that someth i am excit about __PUNCT__
that is we realli got seriou about thi __PUNCT__ there mai be a substitut for the intern combust engin __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ we ar look for wai to make it burn more cleanli __PUNCT__ we ar look for better sourc of fuel from cellulos ethanol and other sourc __PUNCT__ we look at hydrogen __PUNCT__
i not even sure we know all the possibl __PUNCT__
i want young peopl to be as excit about pioneer energi and deal with global warm as __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ peopl like bill gate were about pioneer the internet __PUNCT__
i also want to acceler the us of altern fuel __PUNCT__ particularli in transport __PUNCT__
we just pass a senat energi bill a few week ago __PUNCT__ we did sever good thing __PUNCT__ we rais ga mileag __PUNCT__ though there ar mani who wish who wish could gone further and of cours i understand that __PUNCT__
but just get fro __NUM__ to __NUM__ and get the vote we have in the face of tremend resist __PUNCT__ wa a great step forward __PUNCT__
we also did work veri hard to increas the potenti goal for ethanol __PUNCT__
and we rais the ratio __PUNCT__
peopl ar start to rais legitim concern about the impact of corn __PUNCT__ base ethanol on life style price __PUNCT__ on food price __PUNCT__ the effect on land __PUNCT__
so what we said is that we want to get to __NUM__ million gallon but we want to revers so we have __NUM__ from corn ethanol and __NUM__ from what call cellulos ethanol __PUNCT__ which is just about anyth that grow to see whether we can get the energi out of the plant and turn it into ethanol that can be mix with ga __PUNCT__
and dartmouth ha done some veri interest work on thi __PUNCT__ creat a process to extract the sugar energi and the carbohydr energi out of the plant base materi and i excit becaus the first plant that will be built to see if the dartmouth process work __PUNCT__ will be in rochest __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__
so we realli go to see a lot of great work be done now with differ form of ethanol __PUNCT__
we also need to look at what more we can do to try to encourag effici __PUNCT__
i mention the green build fund __PUNCT__
i also introduc legisl with senat kerri __PUNCT__ john kerri __PUNCT__ he and i have legisl to requir that feder build get more effici __PUNCT__
the feder govern own or rent over __NUM__ build around the countri __PUNCT__
thei spend __MONEY__ billion heat __PUNCT__ cool __PUNCT__ and power those build and the fact is that if the feder govern took the lead on make these build effici __PUNCT__ thei would creat a market that would help the all rest of us __PUNCT__
becaus you know the feder govern is out their sai we want to have floresc bulb __PUNCT__ but we like them to have a somewhat better color of their light __PUNCT__ than the usual floresc light __PUNCT__ can you come up with some new idea __PUNCT__
with a huge buyer like that __PUNCT__ it would realli move peopl __PUNCT__
so that compact floresc bulb might have __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ somewhat softer light __PUNCT__
and you know the big problem with floresc bulb is that too mani women tri on bath suit in front of too mani mirror __PUNCT__
and we don't like that color light __PUNCT__
so you know my husband walk around the hous with bag of compact fluoresc put them in anywher he can find a place __PUNCT__
and we were take about it the other dai and he said the big object with those is how to make them those have a slightli softer look to them __PUNCT__
so that we all look good __PUNCT__
and that sort of the aesthet of that __PUNCT__
so there a lot of research we could do there __PUNCT__ and if the feder govern would lead the wai __PUNCT__ it would move much more quickli __PUNCT__
we also know that right now we could make chang in a lot of our build __PUNCT__
and i actual team up much to everyon surpris with probabl the congress __PUNCT__ lead skeptic on global warm __PUNCT__ jim inhoff __PUNCT__ the senat from oklahoma who chair the environ committe for most of my time in the senat when i serv on the committe __PUNCT__
but senat inhoff and i just got pass in the energi bill a provis to tell the feder govern to look at how thei could power their build differ right now __PUNCT__
don't wait __PUNCT__
includ look a geotherm __PUNCT__ which in mani part of the countri ha tremend possibl __PUNCT__
we done some geotherm work in new york __PUNCT__
there a town auburn __PUNCT__ new york where geotherm is heat and cool the citi hall where their us geotherm in a few other of the facil __PUNCT__
we just want a lot of other differ idea to happen __PUNCT__
solar energi remain an under util sourc of power __PUNCT__ particulari electr __PUNCT__
other countri have move much more quickli __PUNCT__
germani is get a lot of their power from solar now __PUNCT__
and thei not a tropic climat and yet thei have a combin of govern incent and public educ program go on that had move a lot of peopl toward photovolta cell on their roof in their construct __PUNCT__
we got to figur out how to incentiv that __PUNCT__
on of the problem we face is the resist to us the tax structur to chang behavior becaus by us the tax structur __PUNCT__ you will move peopl awai from fossil fuel __PUNCT__ that where the oil compani and the ga and the coal compani come back in __PUNCT__
thei don't want us to give a lot of tax incent __PUNCT__
we tri to do that in the energi bill __PUNCT__ we got __NUM__ bipartisan vote but we need __NUM__ under the rule of the senat __PUNCT__ so we ar go to go back and try again __PUNCT__
but the reason we didn't is becaus if we put more tax monei on more solar __PUNCT__ more wind __PUNCT__ more geotherm it would mean that the oil compani __PUNCT__ coal compani __PUNCT__ ga compani would obvious start lose market share __PUNCT__
so we still have real polit challeng here that we ar go to try and address __PUNCT__
let me just finish by talk about __NUM__ thing that ar realli near and dear to me that i have work on sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i not new to these issu i care deepli about them and have been involv in them for a long time __PUNCT__
the first wa someth that i understand a lot of your school ar do and i couldn't find the real brochur so i brought thi copi __PUNCT__ but back in __NUM__ i sent out thi brochur to everi school district in new york and it sai __PUNCT__ smart school save energi __PUNCT__
becaus i did a survei about how much monei school district __PUNCT__ which ar alwai hard press for monei in new york and i know here in new hampshir that most school spend more monei on energi than thei do on book or comput __PUNCT__
and by simpl chang that might cost some front __PUNCT__ end monei __PUNCT__ thei would begin to save __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent through better build design __PUNCT__ us of renew energi technolog and sensibl chang in oper and mainten __PUNCT__
and that wa back in __NUM__ becaus as a travel around new york i realiz there ar a lot of old school build __PUNCT__ thei need to be weather __PUNCT__ thei need to be upgrad __PUNCT__ with some initi invest __PUNCT__ thei could save a lot of monei of the next __NUM__ to __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
the other thing i done over the last sever year is work veri hard with rochest __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ as you just heard is go to be the place of the plant that will us the dartmouth technolog __PUNCT__
and i brought in the us green build council and other folk that were interest __PUNCT__
and we creat a green print for rochest __PUNCT__
we spent a coupl of year do it __PUNCT__ bring everyon to the tabl __PUNCT__ privat sector __PUNCT__ public sector __PUNCT__ outsid expert and thi report is the result __PUNCT__
look at how on citi could move on all level at on time __PUNCT__
what could be done to make build more effici __PUNCT__ to have an outreach campaign to citizen so we would turn off light when we left the room __PUNCT__
we would unplug applianc that would such up energi when thei were not work __PUNCT__
that we would us compact floresc bulb that we would try to be more consciou about how we drove __PUNCT__ mayb be more effici in our drive pattern and so much els that we could do on a local person level as well as a local level through municip plan __PUNCT__
and i am realli convinc that we have to move on all these level at on time __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we cannot be success if we don't have a presid who believ in thi mission __PUNCT__
i believ in thi mission __PUNCT__
and i will start be reignit our intern involv __PUNCT__
we cannot sit here __PUNCT__ in the unit sate and expect to deal with global warm if we do not cooper with other countri __PUNCT__
get back into process __PUNCT__ you know when presid bush took us out of kyoto __PUNCT__ i regret that but he had an opportun to start hi own process __PUNCT__ he didn't want to do kyoto __PUNCT__ do someth els __PUNCT__
reach out to india and china thei have to be part of thi __PUNCT__
on of the flaw of the kyoto process wa i don't think peopl anticip __PUNCT__ even in the earli 90 how quickli china and india would grow __PUNCT__
china is now grow at __NUM__ percent a year __PUNCT__
thei ar the second highest user of energi but thei ar now the highest emitt of green hous gase in the world __PUNCT__
india is not far behind __PUNCT__
we have got to get a new intern process __PUNCT__
the disput about the scienc is thankfulli over the ipcc final put that rest last year __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ get that off the tabl __PUNCT__
what is it that we ar go to do __PUNCT__ what kind of presidenti leadership do we have internation __PUNCT__ and then build a coalit here at home to pass the energi legisl to the global warm legisl and let not forget the environment health piec of thi __PUNCT__
and that the last thing i go to sai __PUNCT__
everi year i have been a senat i have introduc legisl to creat an environment health track system __PUNCT__
there ar realli three trigger __PUNCT__ genet __PUNCT__ behavior and environ and their interact __PUNCT__ what we know is that the environ plai a big roll __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i repres place in new york citi where w25 __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ percent of the children have seriou asthma __PUNCT__
it just so happen thei live in poor live condit __PUNCT__
thei live where there ar a lot of bu depot and taxi depot where lost of car ar run a spew out emiss all the time and there is a connect __PUNCT__ we know that __PUNCT__
and i know __PUNCT__ have work for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ on behalf of the victim of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ firefight __PUNCT__ polic offic and other who have been sever affect by what thei breath that dai __PUNCT__
how anyon could argu that what we breath doe not affect our health __PUNCT__ after __NUM__ is just imposs to understand __PUNCT__
and we now have peopl who ar dy becaus of their exposur on __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so the debat should be over about environment effect __PUNCT__
clean air is good for us on mani level __PUNCT__
but it is especi good for our health __PUNCT__ it is especi good for our children health __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i am pleas to be here and excit about talk to you __PUNCT__
these issu ar critic to our countri __PUNCT__ our secur __PUNCT__ our environ __PUNCT__ and our employ opportun to creat million of new job __PUNCT__
and the unit state must lead the wai and i will do that when i am elect presid __PUNCT__
