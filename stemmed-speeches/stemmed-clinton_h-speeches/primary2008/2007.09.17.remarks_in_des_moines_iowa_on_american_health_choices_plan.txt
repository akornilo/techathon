becaus like you __PUNCT__ i rememb how we enter the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ fill with hope __PUNCT__ readi to seiz the promis of a more prosper nation and a more peac world __PUNCT__
but like you __PUNCT__ i seen how in the last six and a half year __PUNCT__ we done just the opposit __PUNCT__
we gotten mire in anoth countri civil war __PUNCT__ a war without a militari solut __PUNCT__
we have fail to invest in our futur __PUNCT__ in our school __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ scienc and infrastructur __PUNCT__
and we fall behind __PUNCT__
cost ar rise and wage ar lag __PUNCT__
premium have almost doubl __PUNCT__ up __NUM__ no __PUNCT__ up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and half of all person bankruptci in america ar caus by medic bill __PUNCT__
if there wa ever a need for chang in america it is now __PUNCT__
and if there wa ever a moment to do what america doe best __PUNCT__ to confront the challeng we face __PUNCT__ thi is it __PUNCT__
that what we alwai done __PUNCT__ whether it wa teddi roosevelt bust the trust __PUNCT__ or fdr seek to end elderli poverti __PUNCT__ whether it wa presid truman send the gi to colleg and into the middl class __PUNCT__ or presid johnson ensur health care for all american in their golden year and who were poor __PUNCT__
when the time for chang came __PUNCT__ we weren't afraid __PUNCT__ we didn't look awai __PUNCT__ we came togeth and we made american stronger __PUNCT__ more prosper __PUNCT__ and more fair __PUNCT__
we ar and have alwai been a nation of opportun __PUNCT__ a nation that believ in give everyon a chanc to make the most of their own live __PUNCT__
and of cours we believ in respons __PUNCT__
but when famili ar struggl __PUNCT__ when thei don't have the basic necess that allow them to see these opportun __PUNCT__ we don't leav them to fend for themselv __PUNCT__
unfortun that exactli what we seen in the past six and a half year __PUNCT__
instead of an era of opportun __PUNCT__ we had a __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__ era __PUNCT__
so mani peopl __PUNCT__ famili who can't afford health care __PUNCT__ young peopl who can't afford colleg __PUNCT__ senior who can't afford to retir __PUNCT__ it like thei ar invis to the presid __PUNCT__ like he look right through them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think anyon in america should be invis __PUNCT__
i believ everi child should have a world class educ __PUNCT__ everi worker should have a job with good wage and good benefit __PUNCT__ everi american should have a secur retir __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ as we strive for a new begin to the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ i believ everyon __PUNCT__ everi man __PUNCT__ woman and child __PUNCT__ should have qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care in america __PUNCT__
we should do it __PUNCT__
we should do it becaus in thi new economi __PUNCT__ when peopl move job more than ever befor __PUNCT__ their health insur should move with them __PUNCT__
we should do it becaus doctor and nurs __PUNCT__ not insur compani employe __PUNCT__ should be call the shot on patient care __PUNCT__
we should do it becaus solv the health care crisi is kei to ensur american competit in the global marketplac __PUNCT__
we should do it becaus in a nation where we split the atom __PUNCT__ sent a man to the moon __PUNCT__ map the human genom __PUNCT__ where we have some of the most promis treatment and cure avail __PUNCT__ hard work peopl should get the care thei need when thei sick __PUNCT__
and we should do it becaus it is the right thing to do __PUNCT__
becaus we can no longer toler the injustic of a system that shut out nearli on in six american __PUNCT__
ultim thi is about who we ar as a peopl and what we stand for __PUNCT__
we can talk all we want about freedom and opportun __PUNCT__ about life __PUNCT__ liberti and the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__ but what doe all that mean to a mother or father who can't take a sick child to the doctor __PUNCT__ to someon who can't take the job of hi dream becaus it doesn't offer health care __PUNCT__ to a famili file for bankruptci or lose their home becaus their medic bill were just too high __PUNCT__ we ar the richest countri in the world and we spend right now __PUNCT__ more on health care than anyon els in the world __PUNCT__
two trillion dollar a year __PUNCT__
but we rank __NUM__ in life expect and __NUM__ in child mortal __PUNCT__
each year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ peopl die in america becaus thei don't have health care __PUNCT__
let me repeat that __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ peopl ar dy becaus thei couldn't get the care thei need when thei were sick __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ over the past six and a half year __PUNCT__ the special interest have had a field dai at the expens of the middl class and hard __PUNCT__ work famili __PUNCT__
just look at our prescript drug program __PUNCT__
it doesn't allow medicar to us it purchas power to negoti lower drug price __PUNCT__
so everi year __PUNCT__ billion of dollar go straight from the pocket of famili to the profit of drug compani __PUNCT__
thi is unconscion __PUNCT__ it is intoler and it is time to put an end to it __PUNCT__
it is time for us to come togeth and to start live up to our own valu __PUNCT__
to provid qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
and i intend to be the presid who accomplish that goal final for our countri __PUNCT__
now as you mai know __PUNCT__ i been fight on health care for nearli thirti year __PUNCT__
start as first ladi of arkansa __PUNCT__ where i head a task forc to improv rural health care __PUNCT__
and most memor of cours back in the earli 1990 __PUNCT__ and i still have the scar to show from that exercis __PUNCT__
but i also learn some valuabl lesson that have shape how i approach health care reform todai __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i think we have all learn that america need to provid health insur for all american __PUNCT__
the last twelv year have shown how left on their own __PUNCT__ thi crisi and those who contribut to it __PUNCT__ and peopl from all corner of our economi will see our situat deterior __PUNCT__
a grow number of ceo and union leader ar come togeth becaus thei agre that now is the right time to renew the nation call for qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care __PUNCT__
when andi stern __PUNCT__ the presid of seiu stand with lee scott __PUNCT__ the presid of wal __PUNCT__ mart __PUNCT__ and thei both demand health care reform that cover everyon __PUNCT__ you know we readi for chang __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i learn that peopl who ar satisfi with their current coverag __PUNCT__ want assur that thei can keep it __PUNCT__
part of our health care system is the best in the world and we should build on it __PUNCT__
part is broken __PUNCT__ and we should fix it __PUNCT__
the first rule of medicin is do no harm __PUNCT__
and we will do no harm to the part of our system that ar work __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we will build on them __PUNCT__
that mean not just expand coverag __PUNCT__ but also cut cost and improv qualiti __PUNCT__ so that we will have health care for all __PUNCT__ and better health care for all __PUNCT__
becaus we need to address the concern of those who have insur __PUNCT__ as well as those who do not __PUNCT__
that why i start my path to thi place here __PUNCT__ at broadlawn __PUNCT__ with a seri of health care speech __PUNCT__
i gave a speech on lower health care cost which help everyon in the system __PUNCT__
and i gave a speech on improv qualiti __PUNCT__ which also help everyon __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i learn how import it is to present a plan that is clear and easi to understand __PUNCT__
todai plan is simpler __PUNCT__ yet still bold __PUNCT__
now i know my republican oppon will try to equat health care for all american with govern run health care __PUNCT__
well don't let them fool us again __PUNCT__
thi is not govern run __PUNCT__
there will be no new bureaucraci __PUNCT__
you can keep the doctor you know and trust __PUNCT__
you keep the insur you have if you like it __PUNCT__
but thi plan expand person choic and increas competit to keep cost down __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ i learn about how to build the nation consensu you need to get health care pass __PUNCT__
my plan is the result of discuss with mani peopl __PUNCT__ doctor and nurs __PUNCT__ hospit administr __PUNCT__ and lawyer __PUNCT__ union and most importantli __PUNCT__ america famili __PUNCT__ who ar frustrat with the system we have now __PUNCT__
i have been ask a lot of question and do a lot of listen __PUNCT__
have spent six year in the senat __PUNCT__ i know that fix health care will requir polit will to get the vote we need __PUNCT__ and it will take a movement for chang __PUNCT__ a solid nation consensu for reform that can withstand the impact of the special interest __PUNCT__
and i will work to build that movement throughout my campaign and as your presid __PUNCT__
becaus in the end __PUNCT__ chang is just a word unless you have the strength and experi to make it happen __PUNCT__
these ar new time and thi is a new plan __PUNCT__
and when it come to health care reform __PUNCT__ i believ i have exactli the experi we need to get it done in my first term as presid __PUNCT__
while i wa disappoint by what happen in __NUM__ i did not give up __PUNCT__
i continu to fight __PUNCT__
i work to expand coverag step by step __PUNCT__ person by person __PUNCT__
i began work to expand and improv health care for children __PUNCT__ help to creat the state children health insur program __PUNCT__
it known as the hawk __PUNCT__ i program here in iowa __PUNCT__
that program provid insur for more than six million low __PUNCT__ incom children __PUNCT__
and i work to creat the vaccin for children program __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ childhood immun ar at an all __PUNCT__ time high __PUNCT__
i work to ensur that new prescript drug ar test not just for adult __PUNCT__ but for children too __PUNCT__
and i wrote legisl in the senat to get that accomplish __PUNCT__ becaus children should have access to the best and safest treatment and cure avail __PUNCT__
i also work as first ladi to ensur that breast and cervic cancer treatment would be cover by medicaid __PUNCT__
and i help to establish the commiss that recogn gulf war ill as the seriou problem it is for our vet who serv in the first gulf war __PUNCT__ and we began to address it __PUNCT__
in the senat i work to expand health care to our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
believ it or not __PUNCT__ mani of our nation guard and reserv member __PUNCT__ the men and women who have been call to fight in iraq and afghanistan did not have health insur for themselv or their famili when thei were activ __PUNCT__
i proud of the legisl i pass to address that glare problem __PUNCT__
i been fight more gener to improv health care for veteran becaus it is outrag that so mani servic member ar return home and be told to take a number and wait in line for the health care thei need __PUNCT__
and i will pass what call the hero at home legisl that help those affect by traumat brain injuri and support their famili __PUNCT__
i fight to improv care for our senior __PUNCT__ to lower prescript drug cost by empow medicar to negoti with drug compani and by allow import of our drug from canada at lower price __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ follow the horrif attack of 9/11 __PUNCT__ i fought the epa and the bush administr when thei claim that the air at ground zero wa safe __PUNCT__ safe for our first respond and emerg worker __PUNCT__ safe for our construct and build trade worker __PUNCT__ safe for our resid and our volunt __PUNCT__
it wasn't __PUNCT__
so i fought for health care for all of the first respond __PUNCT__ the worker __PUNCT__ the volunt and resid who have gotten sick and some have even di __PUNCT__
and i will keep fight to protect them until thei have the care thei need __PUNCT__
i know that reform health care take a consensu for chang __PUNCT__
that what i been do __PUNCT__ build that consensu vote by vote __PUNCT__ work to bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__ to get my colleagu from across the aisl to join our caus __PUNCT__
unfortun back in __NUM__ and __PUNCT__ __NUM__ too mani of our oppon adopt a strategi that allow them to __PUNCT__ just sai no __PUNCT__
thei said no __PUNCT__ not just to our health care plan __PUNCT__ but ani health care plan __PUNCT__
and the current administr hasn't even tri __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the presid most newsworthi contribut on health care wa hi recent threat to veto coverag for low __PUNCT__ incom children __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ todai american ar impati __PUNCT__
we seen that do noth make the problem wors __PUNCT__
we gone from __NUM__ million uninsur in __NUM__ to __NUM__ million todai __PUNCT__
from spend __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our gross domest product for health care to spend __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and now we ar spend __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more per person than the next highest spend countri in the world __PUNCT__ switzerland __PUNCT__ which ha high qualiti and good outcom for the peopl there __PUNCT__
so todai we ar spend more monei and cover fewer peopl and too mani of our famili ar pai the price __PUNCT__
we know we have to act __PUNCT__
and so the question is __PUNCT__ if union leader and employ can come togeth __PUNCT__ that the mayo clinic ha just done an extens survei includ __NUM__ expert come to a report urg that we have health care reform __PUNCT__ if democrat and republican governor and legislatur can work togeth on health care __PUNCT__ if doctor __PUNCT__ nurs __PUNCT__ patient __PUNCT__ hospit administr __PUNCT__ ceo __PUNCT__ small busi owner can all agre that it is time for a chang __PUNCT__ then why can't washington __PUNCT__ i believ that togeth we can chang washington by stick to our principl and reach out to find common ground __PUNCT__
america face a choic __PUNCT__ continu the statu quo as more and more peopl lose coverag or chang our system to cover all of our peopl __PUNCT__
i believ that is america choic __PUNCT__ to do someth about health care __PUNCT__ america choic to tackl problem of cost __PUNCT__ qualiti __PUNCT__ and coverag __PUNCT__
it should be everi american choic to have the kind of health care that thei want __PUNCT__
that choic is at the heart of my plan __PUNCT__
i call my plan __PUNCT__ the american health choic plan __PUNCT__
thi plan is the result of a thorough analysi of the natur and extent of the health care crisi __PUNCT__ start with the realiti that roughli eight in ten of the uninsur __PUNCT__ those who come through the door of thi medic center __PUNCT__ come from work famili __PUNCT__ most ar middl class __PUNCT__
and famili earn between __MONEY__ and __MONEY__ dollar a year ar the fast grow group of the uninsur __PUNCT__
we all know that younger adult __PUNCT__ ag __NUM__ and older adult __PUNCT__ ag __NUM__ __PUNCT__ ar the most suscept to lose insur coverag __PUNCT__ indic that it hard to obtain coverag when you first start out in the world of work and harder to maintain it as you ag and experi health problem __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ employ sponsor health insur is on the declin __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of employ offer health benefit __PUNCT__ down from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ six year ago __PUNCT__
thi is at a time when peopl ar chang job more frequent than ever befor __PUNCT__
mani american ar now self __PUNCT__ emploi __PUNCT__ run busi out of their home and thei struggl to bui health insur __PUNCT__
my plan take all of these realiti into account and address them head on __PUNCT__
and thi plan isn't just my plan __PUNCT__
it the product of hundr of discuss with thousand of peopl in hospit __PUNCT__ and union hall __PUNCT__ home and busi across america and go forward in thi campaign and then as presid __PUNCT__ i go to keep reach out __PUNCT__ ask for idea __PUNCT__ not just in improv and enact the plan __PUNCT__ but in the daili work to make it a realiti __PUNCT__
now here how thi plan would work __PUNCT__
if you have privat insur you like __PUNCT__ noth chang __PUNCT__ you can keep that insur __PUNCT__
if you like the doctor you have __PUNCT__ you can keep see that doctor __PUNCT__
if you like the hospit where you receiv care __PUNCT__ you can keep receiv care at that hospit __PUNCT__
if __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ you don't have health insur or you don't like the insur you have __PUNCT__ you can choos from the same wide varieti of privat plan that member of congress choos from __PUNCT__
i call it a health choic menu __PUNCT__
so essenti the congression health care plan becom the american health care plan __PUNCT__
the idea here is simpl __PUNCT__
the american peopl should have access to the same arrai of health care choic and benefit as the senat and repres thei elect __PUNCT__
you will also have as on of those choic a public plan __PUNCT__ just like medicar is a public plan __PUNCT__
you will have access to a public plan that will provid a stabl __PUNCT__ competit altern to privat insur if that is your choic __PUNCT__
my plan doe not creat a singl new govern depart __PUNCT__ agenc __PUNCT__ or bureaucraci __PUNCT__
it is not a govern takeov of health care __PUNCT__
it is a public __PUNCT__ privat partnership that provid more choic __PUNCT__
if you an employ __PUNCT__ you choos whichev plan is best for your busi __PUNCT__
if you an individu __PUNCT__ you choos whichev plan is best for you and your famili and we will provid tax credit to ensur that you can pai for it __PUNCT__
now whether you keep the insur you have __PUNCT__ or you choos on of the option in the health choic menu __PUNCT__ you will have the follow guarante __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ you will never be deni coverag becaus of preexist condit or risk factor __PUNCT__
insur compani will no longer be allow to discrimin against high risk patient or charg exorbit premium to screen them out __PUNCT__
so whether you were sick in the past or a genet test show you mai get sick in the futur __PUNCT__ you will never again have to worri about find afford coverag __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ your coverag will be guarante __PUNCT__
if you pai your premium and follow the rule your insur compani will be requir to renew your coverag each year at a price you can afford __PUNCT__ even if you lose your job __PUNCT__ even if you decid to start your own busi or stai home with your children for a few year __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ your coverag will be afford __PUNCT__
my plan provid tax credit to make health care both univers and afford for everyon __PUNCT__
these new tax credit guarante that you never pai more than a certain percentag of your incom for your premium __PUNCT__
no more worri that on ill or on accid will lead to financi ruin __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ you will alwai have an option for coverag that is fulli afford __PUNCT__
i will requir insur compani in the health choic menu to let you take your plan with you as you move from job to job or even state to state __PUNCT__
now exactli __PUNCT__ how will all of thi be possibl __PUNCT__ well it go to take share respons __PUNCT__
everyon with a stake in our health care system will have to step forward and do their part __PUNCT__
while i will be requir all american to have health care __PUNCT__ i will be call on employ to do their part as well __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ larg american compani compet in a global economi against compani in countri that impos far lower health care burden on employ and mani of our manufactur ar struggl to pai for retire health commit that our foreign competitor simpli don't have __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ larg compani will be requir to help pai for their employe __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__
those that do so can simpli maintain their current polici that thei choos __PUNCT__
those that don't __PUNCT__ will need to contribut toward the cost of cover their employe on a slide scale base on their size and averag wage __PUNCT__
my plan also help american manufactur becom more competit by provid a tax credit for those struggl with the high cost of retire health benefit __PUNCT__
these cost ar make it virtual imposs for american manufactur to compet with their foreign counterpart __PUNCT__ who don't have these kind of cost __PUNCT__
how can we possibl compet if a car compani like gener motor pai __MONEY__ in health care cost per car produc while toyota is onli pai __MONEY__ per car __PUNCT__ and think about the retire who reli on these benefit todai __PUNCT__
peopl have accept lower wage over the year in return for the promis of a secur retir __PUNCT__
the tax credit i provid will help employ cover catastroph cost abov a certain threshold __PUNCT__ cost incur by a few retire with the most of your health problem __PUNCT__ cost that can run hundr of thousand of dollar for a singl person __PUNCT__
thi relief will be a temporari measur design to address the need of the ag babi boomer and it will be avail not just to qualifi privat sector manufactur but to state to help pai retire cost for teacher __PUNCT__ polic offic __PUNCT__ fire fighter __PUNCT__ and other __PUNCT__
in return for thi assist __PUNCT__ compani will have to modern their plan with initi to cut wast and improv qualiti __PUNCT__ and thei will have to show that thei us the tax credit to enhanc their competit and support their worker __PUNCT__
we also know that health care cost ar plagu too mani of our small busi __PUNCT__
that a seriou problem __PUNCT__ becaus small busi ar now the engin of job creation in america __PUNCT__
accord to the feder reserv __PUNCT__ sinc __NUM__ compani with fewer than __NUM__ employe were respons for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the addit new job in america __PUNCT__ job that often cannot be outsourc __PUNCT__
but at the same time __PUNCT__ small busi face higher premium becaus of their limit purchas power __PUNCT__ and thei tend to emploi lower __PUNCT__ incom worker __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ thei cover far fewer of their employe __PUNCT__
and that coverag is erod __PUNCT__
sinc __NUM__ the percentag of small busi offer benefit ha fallen from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ under my plan __PUNCT__ we won't requir small busi to cover employe __PUNCT__
instead we will provid tax credit to ensur that mani of them do __PUNCT__
these tax credit will be base on size and averag wage __PUNCT__ so that small busi can provid health care without destroi their bottom line __PUNCT__
thi credit could be as high as __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of premium for firm with fewer than __NUM__ employe __PUNCT__
it a good start that small busi ar lead the wai in creat new job __PUNCT__
my goal is for them to creat new job with good health care benefit as well __PUNCT__
govern also need to do it part to promot share respons __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ the govern will provid tax __PUNCT__ credit to insur that everi singl american can afford health insur __PUNCT__
the govern will also invest in measur to improv health care qualiti and cut cost __PUNCT__
thi will result in dramat save which i will us to continu to make health care afford __PUNCT__
i outlin my cost __PUNCT__ save measur in a speech back in mai __PUNCT__
i propos a seven __PUNCT__ point plan to save __MONEY__ billion nation each year by bring our health care system into the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri __PUNCT__ by transit from outdat paper record to an electron medic record system __PUNCT__ by get our chronic diseas manag cost under control __PUNCT__ by allow compani to compet for medicar prescript drug busi __PUNCT__ and more __PUNCT__
last month in new hampshir __PUNCT__ i laid out my agenda to improv health care qualiti __PUNCT__ a plan to rais standard __PUNCT__ educ patient and help our doctor and nurs provid world __PUNCT__ class care __PUNCT__
taken togeth these polici could save hundr of dollar a year for the averag american famili __PUNCT__ and make american healthier __PUNCT__
individu will have to share the respons as well __PUNCT__
much like driver in most state ar requir to purchas car insur __PUNCT__ all american will have a respons to get and keep health insur in a system where insur will now be afford __PUNCT__
the sad realiti is that the uninsur don't just struggl with cost themselv __PUNCT__ thei impos cost on the rest of us __PUNCT__
it a hidden tax __PUNCT__
the high cost of emerg room visit that could have been prevent by a much less expens doctor appoint __PUNCT__ the cost of unpaid medic bill that lead insur compani to rais rate on the rest of us __PUNCT__
cover these individu is the onli wai to get rid of these hidden tax __PUNCT__
the onli wai to guarante afford coverag for everyon is to cover everyon __PUNCT__ and that is the choic we need for america __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i call on drug compani and insur compani to do their part as well __PUNCT__
it is time that we put patient __PUNCT__ not drug compani and insur compani __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__
that mean chang the wai thei do busi __PUNCT__
now clearli with drug compani we have to do more to get gener drug to market __PUNCT__ includ the new biolog that ar come into the marketplac and ar often extrem expens __PUNCT__
we do have to provid more negoti to get drug price down and to import from canada and other countri that ar similar to our __PUNCT__
becaus ultim __PUNCT__ the american tax payer pai for the develop of a lot of these drug through nih grant and other kind of research grant __PUNCT__ we pai for the clinic trial __PUNCT__ and then we pai the highest price in the world __PUNCT__
and we go to begin to rein that in __PUNCT__
it also mean chang the wai insur compani do busi in america __PUNCT__
i will start by ban insur compani discrimin __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ insur compani have free reign to cherri pick the healthiest patient and shut out anyon who seem to them like a bad risk __PUNCT__
insur compani spend __MONEY__ billion a year on elabor calcul and scheme to figur out how not to insur peopl __PUNCT__
__MONEY__ billion try to shut out those who need care the most __PUNCT__
and everydai thei deni peopl coverag becaus of pre __PUNCT__ exist condit or the result of genet test __PUNCT__
think about what thi might mean down the road with advanc in genet test __PUNCT__
the vast major of us could wind up be bad risk becaus genet most of us will probabl show we ar suscept to someth and therefor we will becom uninsur __PUNCT__
so on of the urgenc behind thi plan now is that the insur industri as it ha been construct and execut over decad now will no longer be abl to take care of increas number of american if thei stick with the polici that elimin our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
thi legal discrimin against the sickest of american is unfair and immor and it defeat on of the central purpos of insur __PUNCT__ which is to share risk __PUNCT__
my plan put an end to thi __PUNCT__
it forc insur compani to compet base on cost and qualiti __PUNCT__ not how skillfulli thei can weed out the sickest patient __PUNCT__
my plan also ha a prevent initi __PUNCT__ requir the insur industri and public program like medicar and medicaid to promot well as well as treat ill and provid everi american with comprehens prevent care __PUNCT__
todai we pai doctor and hospit to treat diseas and injuri but not to prevent them from occur in the first place __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we made it increasingli difficult for doctor to do that becaus of the wai insur compani reimburs physician __PUNCT__
diabet care is a perfect exampl __PUNCT__
mani insur compani won't pai for a diabet to see a nutritionist to learn how to eat properli or a podiatrist to get their feet check __PUNCT__ but if you wind up have to have your foot amput from complic due to diabet __PUNCT__ the insur compani will pai for that __PUNCT__
and if you ask why __PUNCT__ the insur compani will tell you __PUNCT__ thei don't want to pai for prevent health care becaus the patient might switch to a differ compani and thei will lose the benefit of the invest in prevent __PUNCT__
but if a patient need hi foot amput __PUNCT__ the reason he goe __PUNCT__ the insur compani is pretti much stuck with that on their watch __PUNCT__
now that is upsid down and backward and i go to chang it becaus i think it time we focus on keep peopl healthi __PUNCT__ not just on treat them when thei becom sick __PUNCT__
now i know that these propos will not make me the insur industri woman of the year __PUNCT__
but i don't think i been in the run for that titl sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ i truli believ there ar plenti of peopl in the insur industri who wish their compani did not make a profit by exclud the woman who discov she genet predispos toward get breast cancer __PUNCT__ or by burden the famili whose child ha autism with unmanag premium __PUNCT__
the idea is not to put the health insur industri out of busi __PUNCT__ but to help it find a better wai to make a live __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ insur compani employe will have a whole new set of incent __PUNCT__
thei will wake up everydai and focu on make profit by provid the highest qualiti care at the lowest cost and thei never again be torn between turn a profit and improv the health care of individu who make sure of commun and our countri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ how will i pai for thi plan __PUNCT__ first let me tell you how i will not pai for it __PUNCT__
i won't pai for it by pour monei into a broken system __PUNCT__
i won't pai for it by rais tax on middl class famili who ar alreadi struggl with rise cost and stagnant wage __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ i pai for part of it by implement the cost save measur i outlin in mai __PUNCT__
and i will pai for some of it by roll back part of presid bush fiscal irrespons tax break for the highest incom american __PUNCT__
and i pai for some of it by limit the tax break for peopl make over __MONEY__ a year to the same level that ordinari __PUNCT__ middl class american get __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the highest incom american get some of the most gener health care benefit and the most gener tax deduct to go with them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ off american should be abl to deduct the cost of the same qualiti health plan that middl __PUNCT__ incom famili can deduct __PUNCT__
if thei want to receiv extra benefit beyond what most middl incom famili get __PUNCT__ thei should pai for it themselv __PUNCT__ not have tax payer foot the bill for them __PUNCT__
announc my plan todai is just on step in a larger process __PUNCT__
in the come month __PUNCT__ i will continu to reach out to peopl all across america and ask for their idea and their reaction __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ to truli reform health care in america __PUNCT__ we need more than a plan __PUNCT__
we need a movement __PUNCT__ a movement of peopl determin to chang the system who will not rest until we succe __PUNCT__
lisa scott from greenvil __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__ whom i met back in mai __PUNCT__ is on of those peopl __PUNCT__

she wa sick for almost a year __PUNCT__

her death certif list the caus of death as unknown __PUNCT__ becaus janel wa never abl to afford a proper diagnosi __PUNCT__ a diagnosi that with care might have save her life __PUNCT__
it too late to help her daughter __PUNCT__ but lisa scott hasn't stop speak out and call on us to come togeth and fix our health care system __PUNCT__
she is determin to help other famili __PUNCT__ to spare them the loss and pain that her famili felt __PUNCT__

where we do understand we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ that when a child is sick and can't see a doctor __PUNCT__ the famili lose everyth becaus someon had an accid __PUNCT__ when a mother or a father li awak at night worri about how thei possibl care for the peopl thei love __PUNCT__
that diminish all of us __PUNCT__
now after __NUM__ when peopl ask me if i wa go to give up on health care reform __PUNCT__ i alwai had the same answer __PUNCT__
why would i give up on america and the american peopl __PUNCT__ for so mani year i have listen to their stori __PUNCT__
