women ar now a major of student in colleg __PUNCT__ and the major of those who vote in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it is noth short of breathtak when you stop to think about it __PUNCT__
but all of thi progress is not a quirk of fate __PUNCT__
it didn't happen by accid __PUNCT__
it is the result of the contribut of women and men from everi background __PUNCT__ serv at everi level __PUNCT__ us their divers arrai of skill and talent to move our nation forward __PUNCT__
contribut from nation leader like carri chapman catt and her colleagu in the suffrag movement __PUNCT__
trailblaz right here in iowa like arabella mansfield who __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ becam the first woman in america formal admit to the bar __PUNCT__
women like sojourn truth who campaign both against slaveri and for women suffrag __PUNCT__
or harriet tubman who risk her life time and again so other could tast the fruit of freedom __PUNCT__
courag women around the world like aung san suu kyi who ha been a virtual prison for decad in the caus of freedom for the burmes peopl __PUNCT__
women who run for offic in their own countri against some tough odd like angela merkel in germani and michel bachelet in chile __PUNCT__ and ellen johnson __PUNCT__ sirleaf in liberia __PUNCT__
but it is not just the women leader in the histori book who made histori __PUNCT__
it is also those unsung hero who transform live and commun everi singl dai __PUNCT__
the teacher who tell our daughter __PUNCT__ you ar just as smart and capabl as the boi __PUNCT__ don't you fail to live up to your potenti __PUNCT__
i think about my __NUM__ grade teacher mr __PUNCT__ king quot from the bibl said not to hide your light under the bushel basket __PUNCT__
the women on the pta who wonder why aren't more girl in those honor math and scienc class __PUNCT__
i rememb when my daughter wa in first grade join up with a coupl of other mother to do extra scienc program for our first grader __PUNCT__
and all those mother who work all dai __PUNCT__ sleep a few hour __PUNCT__ do the night shift __PUNCT__ becaus thei want someth better for their children __PUNCT__
some women have fought lone battl __PUNCT__ forg ahead on their own when no on els would stand by their side __PUNCT__
i think of edna griffin __PUNCT__ call the __PUNCT__ rosa park of iowa __PUNCT__
on __DATE__ she wa refus servic at a de moin lunch counter __PUNCT__
but edna griffin respond by organ picket in front of the store __PUNCT__ and when no on els join her __PUNCT__ she would picket alon __PUNCT__
she took her case all the wai to the iowa suprem court __PUNCT__ and she won __PUNCT__
other women have had the benefit of network of women drawn togeth by share experi and aspir __PUNCT__
i had the privileg of travel to more than __NUM__ countri __PUNCT__
and everywher i been as first ladi and now as senat __PUNCT__ i have tri to find time to meet with women in the countri where i find myself __PUNCT__ to ask them what their live ar like __PUNCT__ what kind of opportun and challeng thei face __PUNCT__
i rememb a woman in northern ireland by the name of joyc mccartan __PUNCT__
joyc __PUNCT__ a cathol __PUNCT__ had lost more than a dozen famili member dure the so call __PUNCT__ troubl __PUNCT__ includ her own seventeen __PUNCT__ year old son who wa shot dead by protest gunmen __PUNCT__
but instead of retreat into anger and grief and want reveng __PUNCT__ she brought togeth a group of both protest and cathol women to set up a safe hous for women of both tradit to talk about their need and their fear over cup of tea __PUNCT__
i sat down with those women on dai and i listen as thei talk about how thei had discov that thei all worri when their husband and son left their home __PUNCT__ and thei were all reliev when thei return safe __PUNCT__
and despit their differ __PUNCT__ thei want a better futur for their countri and their children __PUNCT__
it wa these women __PUNCT__ and other like them __PUNCT__ sit around at kitchen tabl __PUNCT__ share pot of tea __PUNCT__ who help chart the path to peac __PUNCT__
here at home __PUNCT__ dure my time in the senat __PUNCT__ i have cherish the opportun to work with my women colleagu in both hous and on both side of the aisl __PUNCT__
now we mai not see ey to ey on everyth __PUNCT__ but we get togeth and we trade those veri import bit of advic like what kind of shoe to wear on marbl floor when you on your feet all dai __PUNCT__
and when it come to the issu that we can agre on __PUNCT__ whether it afterschool fund or healthcar and educ for women here in america or for women in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we ar a forc to be reckon with __PUNCT__
i been honor to work throughout my career on issu like foster care and adopt __PUNCT__ famili leav __PUNCT__ equal pai and preschool for our children __PUNCT__
and i have alwai been struck when peopl label these as women issu __PUNCT__
i disagre with that character __PUNCT__
while these so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ kitchen tabl __PUNCT__ issu ar certainli women issu __PUNCT__ thei also men issu and children issu __PUNCT__
thei issu that we all have a stake in __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ too mani men have to choos between health insur for themselv or for their children __PUNCT__ becaus thei can't afford both __PUNCT__
when women make just __NUM__ cent for everi dollar a man earn __PUNCT__ it not just women who ar affect __PUNCT__ but famili with less incom to pai the bill __PUNCT__
we all worri about whether the next gener of children will have the tool thei need to compet in the global economi __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ mani father ar struggl to spend more time with their famili just like mother alwai have __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the issu of famili leav provid a particularli good exampl __PUNCT__
i never forget a newspap advic column that i read in the earli 1980 __PUNCT__
i wa work at a law firm at the time and my daughter wa about three year old __PUNCT__
someon had written into thi column ask __PUNCT__ i about to get a big promot and i go to have my own offic for the first time __PUNCT__
what kind of decor ar appropri for my offic __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the advic columnist respond that he need to know if the writer wa a man or a woman becaus it would affect the answer __PUNCT__
if you a man __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ and you have a famili __PUNCT__ put up lot of pictur of your famili becaus peopl will think when thei come into your offic __PUNCT__ thi is a stabl person with a good set of famili valu __PUNCT__
but if you a woman __PUNCT__ don't put ani pictur of your famili in your offic becaus peopl will think you can't keep your mind on your job __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ i immedi fill my offic with pictur of my famili __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ a lot ha chang sinc then __PUNCT__
but unfortun thi attitud is still around __PUNCT__
it kind of sum up too mani peopl feel toward women and parent in the workplac __PUNCT__ keep your famili life to yourself __PUNCT__ struggl on your own to meet the demand of work and famili and don't let it affect your work __PUNCT__
but think about thi for a minut __PUNCT__
a lot of work father wish thei had more time with their children __PUNCT__
all employ want employe to be focus and product __PUNCT__ which is hard to achiev when work and famili ar out of balanc __PUNCT__
and everi american ha a stake in how the next gener is rais __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ we rais our futur innov __PUNCT__ our colleg professor __PUNCT__ our nurs __PUNCT__ our busi leader __PUNCT__ our farmer __PUNCT__ teacher and so much more __PUNCT__
so when we fight to strengthen famili leav __PUNCT__ that help not just women __PUNCT__ but all american who want to spend more time with the peopl thei love and care for __PUNCT__
that why i fight for paid famili leav __PUNCT__ becaus no on should have to worri if thei need a coupl of hour to take their child to the doctor __PUNCT__
and no on should be deni the chanc to bond with their newborn or adopt babi or to care for an ag parent __PUNCT__
i think we should encourag the develop of famili work to take care of on anoth __PUNCT__
there so much care give that goe on in our countri __PUNCT__ we sometim overlook it __PUNCT__
but if all the caregiv __PUNCT__ peopl who devot most or all of their time care for a child __PUNCT__ care for a parent __PUNCT__ care for a love on with a disabl __PUNCT__ if all of those american were to decid tomorrow to stop give that out of love __PUNCT__ to replac that care would cost __NUM__ billion dollar a year __PUNCT__
peopl give it becaus thei love __PUNCT__ thei have a sens of famili oblig __PUNCT__ thei want to do the right thing and we make it veri __PUNCT__ veri hard for famili to care for on anoth __PUNCT__
instead of focus on what is realli go on in peopl live __PUNCT__ too often our polit is about distract __PUNCT__
who up __PUNCT__ who down __PUNCT__
what peopl ar wear more than what thei ar sai __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ there will alwai be that kind of analysi __PUNCT__
but in the end __PUNCT__ none of that realli matter veri much __PUNCT__
what matter ar the live of peopl i meet everi dai who feel like thei invis __PUNCT__
like no on pai attent to them and their struggl __PUNCT__
like the woman i met from leclair who had to sell half her famili farm to pai for her famili medic bill __PUNCT__
she sure feel invis __PUNCT__
or the woman i met at the maid __PUNCT__ rite in toledo who wa work two job and still struggl to get by and she wonder whether anybodi realli see how hard she been work __PUNCT__
the woman in greenvil whose daughter got sick __PUNCT__ but didn't have health insur __PUNCT__
she di a year later __PUNCT__
she wa just eighteen year old __PUNCT__
her death certif list the caus of death as unknown __PUNCT__ becaus she wa never abl to afford to get a proper diagnosi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think that ani of these peopl should be invis in our countri __PUNCT__
thei certainli not invis to me __PUNCT__
i see them __PUNCT__ i hear them __PUNCT__ and i carri their stori with me where ever i go __PUNCT__
and thei shouldn't be invis in our polit process __PUNCT__
on of the aspect of polit that ha chang dramat with the entri of some mani women is that a lot of these stori ar now just out there __PUNCT__ peopl ar talk about them __PUNCT__ try to determin what to do to give someon who is struggl a better chanc __PUNCT__
when i think about the struggl that women had to even get the vote i don't get discourag __PUNCT__ i get inspir __PUNCT__
the first women convent wa held in seneca fall __PUNCT__ new york in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it wa a hot __DATE__ and a group of women decid that thei want to meet togeth at the wesleyan chapel in seneca fall to see if thei could draft a statement claim their right as women __PUNCT__
at that time of cours our law didn't realli give women right in ani aspect of life __PUNCT__ not just at the vote booth but in inherit and marriag and child custodi and so much els __PUNCT__
so these women and a few brave men join togeth on that hot __DATE__ dai to begin a process that led to the declar of sentiment __PUNCT__
it wa the first document that we know of anywher in the world where a group of peopl had come and said women deserv their right __PUNCT__
onli on woman who wa there ar that convent live long enough to see women get the vote in america __PUNCT__
it took more than __NUM__ year from the start of the movement until nineteenth amend wa pass __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ year of faith and devot __PUNCT__ protest and lobbi __PUNCT__
and when i think about the challeng we face todai in polit __PUNCT__ i alwai am in aw of how hard these other women had to struggl to get what we take for grant __PUNCT__
ultim __PUNCT__ thei did succe __PUNCT__ becaus even in the face of the most heartbreak set __PUNCT__ back __PUNCT__ thei never lost sight of what matter and thei refus to give up __PUNCT__
i alwai love the stori of how __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ catt and her colleagu believ that win in new york wa critic to win at the feder level __PUNCT__ so thei fought their heart out __PUNCT__
thei held __NUM__ meet __PUNCT__
thei hand out seven and a half million leaflet __PUNCT__
and thei rais nearli __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ a stagger sum in those dai __PUNCT__
but in the end __PUNCT__ thei lost by nearli __NUM__ vote __PUNCT__
that night __PUNCT__ catt wa ask how long thi defeat would delai their fight nation __PUNCT__
she repli __PUNCT__ onli until we can get a littl sleep __PUNCT__
and two dai after that loss __PUNCT__ thei start a new campaign with a new slogan __PUNCT__ victori in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i grate to her and countless other becaus i know that everi dai i walk in the path thei clear and benefit from the victori thei won __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some might sai that their work is finish in america sinc women no longer face legal obstacl to educ or employ or the right to vote __PUNCT__
but we know that even though legal barrier have fallen awai __PUNCT__ econom and attitudin on still remain __PUNCT__
and that so long as there ar gap between our aspir and our realiti __PUNCT__ their work and our is not finish __PUNCT__
that more perfect union still await __PUNCT__
if we truli want to finish what catt and her colleagu had start __PUNCT__ then it is time we stop pai women __NUM__ cent on the dollar when thei work __NUM__ minut of the hour __PUNCT__ just like men __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we can see that we ar still not where we need to be becaus just thi year the unit state suprem court heard a case of a woman name lilli ledbett __PUNCT__
lilli ledbett work in a factori in alabama __PUNCT__
she work there for over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
she wa a good worker __PUNCT__
she becam a supervisor __PUNCT__ the onli woman to becom a supervisor and year after year she did the same work that all of the male supervisor did __PUNCT__
and about __NUM__ year into her work she learn she had never been paid the same as all of the men __PUNCT__
men with lesser senior __PUNCT__ younger men __PUNCT__ and she wonder why __PUNCT__
and she tri to find out and basic her employ wouldn't answer her question __PUNCT__
and lilli ledbett didn't want to take that for an answer __PUNCT__
so she start talk to peopl in town and somebodi sent her to a lawyer and the lawyer said that against the equal pai act __PUNCT__ we had an equal pai act on the book sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thei can't do that __PUNCT__
the lawyer call the factori and the factori wouldn't talk to the lawyer so the lawyer brought a law suit __PUNCT__
and lilli ledbett won in court and the factori appeal it __PUNCT__
and she won in the appel court and the factori appeal it to the suprem court __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha chang in composit as you know and all of a sudden after everyon thought that the case had been settl __PUNCT__ that if you were discrimin for do the same job as a woman that a man is do you ar entitl to back pai for as long as you have been do that job as a wai to deter other employ from practic discrimin and to make good on the mani hour of work that were not fairli compens __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the new suprem court found a reason to deni lilli ledbett back pai for all of those year __PUNCT__
thei came up with a theori that nobodi had ever heard of befor __PUNCT__
so don't believ that the hard work is over __PUNCT__ we still have a long wai to go __PUNCT__
if we truli want to finish what catt and her colleagu start __PUNCT__ then it time we did more than just talk about famili valu __PUNCT__ we need to adopt polici that truli valu famili __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we stand for univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten all the wai through to afford colleg __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ from qualiti __PUNCT__ afford healthcar for everi american to retir secur for everi american __PUNCT__
paid leav __PUNCT__
flexibl workplac __PUNCT__
we need to recogn the challeng that so mani peopl face todai __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the economi is much more difficult __PUNCT__
the averag american famili ha lost a thousand dollar in incom in the last six year but the cost of everyth els have gone up __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ energi and ga __PUNCT__
it much tougher for young famili to realli pull togeth the time thei need for each other __PUNCT__
the biggest concern that a lot of young famili tell me is that thei don't have enough time __PUNCT__
thei work as hard as thei can __PUNCT__ thei worri about their futur __PUNCT__ thei anxiou about everyth from whether thei have enough to put awai to tide them over on a raini dai to what happen in the mortgag market and what go on if somebodi in their famili get sick __PUNCT__
if we truli want to finish what catt and her colleagu start __PUNCT__ then we need to do someth about our nation debt __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion and count __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ everi babi born todai start life with __MONEY__ of debt on hi or her tini shoulder __PUNCT__ the largest birth tax in histori __PUNCT__
and if we truli want to finish the work that carri chapman catt and her colleagu start __PUNCT__ then we must truli us the power of the vote to make our voic heard __PUNCT__
to take our leader to task __PUNCT__
to build the kind of futur we want for our children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ more than __NUM__ million women did not vote __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ for so long __PUNCT__ carri chapman catt and all the women who work with her were silenc by other __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ too mani women silenc themselv __PUNCT__
as catt onc said __PUNCT__ the vote is a power __PUNCT__ a weapon of offens and defens __PUNCT__ a prayer __PUNCT__
understand what it mean and what it can do for your countri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ more than ever __PUNCT__ we know what the vote can do for our countri __PUNCT__
i meet peopl who ar readi to us it who have never us it befor __PUNCT__
i alwai struck when someon tell me thei vote for the first time __PUNCT__
often it a young person turn __NUM__ __PUNCT__
sometim it a much older person who ha just never regist and never vote __PUNCT__
and then i meet peopl who never miss an elect __PUNCT__
thei believ it their duti and respons to show up whenev the poll ar open __PUNCT__
i meet a lot of women in their nineti who told me thei were born befor women could vote __PUNCT__ and thei want to live long enough to see a woman in the white hous __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and i love it when i hear mother and father whisper to their littl girl __PUNCT__ see honei __PUNCT__ in thi countri you can be anyth you want to be __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that what i believ about our son and our daughter __PUNCT__
there should be no limit on ani of our children in america __PUNCT__
but we have to do the hard work to make sure that is true __PUNCT__
and all too often __PUNCT__ peopl give up their belief and convict becaus thei don't vote leav the field free to those who mai not share their view __PUNCT__ don't care about the same issu that thei care about __PUNCT__ but ar will to be there when it count __PUNCT__
we need to do everyth we can to heed carri chapman catt admonit to __PUNCT__ roll up your sleev and set your mind to make histori __PUNCT__ that what american have been do for over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
it wasn't by accid that the first meet ever held in the world to talk about and write down what right women were entitl to happen in america __PUNCT__
we have to keep faith with the work __PUNCT__ the struggl and the sacrific of those who have come befor __PUNCT__
we have to be remind from time to time that freedom isn't free and equal cannot be taken for grant __PUNCT__
everi gener face new challeng and everi gener ha to step up and be heard and exercis their constitut right to make a differ __PUNCT__
that what we do when we at our best in america __PUNCT__
