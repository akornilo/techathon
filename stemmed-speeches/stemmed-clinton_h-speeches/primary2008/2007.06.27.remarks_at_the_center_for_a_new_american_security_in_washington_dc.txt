toward a new american secur __PUNCT__ is exactli the right titl for thi forum __PUNCT__
we ar in a moment of profound chang and challeng that requir new think and a new direct __PUNCT__
as american we bear much respons for the global econom __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ and democrat revolut we ar experienc __PUNCT__
everi dai the world grow smaller and histori move faster __PUNCT__
decis by a factori owner in china impact the health and safeti of children in chicago __PUNCT__
american research us the web to share best practic __PUNCT__ but so do islamist extremist __PUNCT__
and pandem do not know where evil nation end and good nation begin __PUNCT__ a fact that i sure greatli disturb the vice presid __PUNCT__
amidst the global transform to an interdepend world our nation confront possibl of promis and peril __PUNCT__
we know the current secur polici with it excess relianc on unilater forc __PUNCT__ it reject of intern agreement of all kind __PUNCT__ and it prefer for polici make base on ideolog __PUNCT__ not evid __PUNCT__ ha to chang __PUNCT__
but let begin with some basic assumpt root in realiti __PUNCT__
in thi interdepend world __PUNCT__ the unit state cannot unilater kill __PUNCT__ jail __PUNCT__ occupi or isol all of our actual or potenti adversari __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ while a strong militari remain essenti to our secur __PUNCT__ it is not suffici __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ there ar few secur challeng we can meet entir on our own __PUNCT__
so in the word of secretari albright __PUNCT__ we should cooper with other whenev we can and act alon onli when we have to __PUNCT__
not the other wai around __PUNCT__
when i wa first ladi __PUNCT__ i wa honor to visit __NUM__ countri repres our nation __PUNCT__
i wit the promis of america in the ey of men __PUNCT__ women and children __PUNCT__
america repres hope __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__
as a unit state senat i continu to meet with leader from around the globe and as a member of the senat arm servic committe __PUNCT__ travel to place where our militari ha been engag and perform heroic __PUNCT__
and what we have seen here and around the world is that the administr ha systemat broken down and thrown asid our hard __PUNCT__ won partnership and allianc and undermin our greatest asset __PUNCT__ america moral author __PUNCT__ not just destroi the work of the previou decad but the difficult work of more than a half centuri of internation practic by democrat and republican administr alik __PUNCT__
all too often the administr ha favor ideolog over realiti __PUNCT__ promot tough talk over tough decis __PUNCT__ and sown alien instead of cooper __PUNCT__
the next presid will take offic at a time when the unit state face the greatest confluenc of challeng in our countri recent histori __PUNCT__
we must regain our place in the world with a new secur polici that serv our nation interest __PUNCT__ recaptur our moral author __PUNCT__ work with our alli __PUNCT__ modern our militari __PUNCT__ and confid project our valu __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ we must rebuild our strength and widen and deepen it scope __PUNCT__
we have to be both internationalist and realist __PUNCT__
we have to renew those allianc around the world __PUNCT__ around a common set of goal includ combat genocid __PUNCT__ expand human right __PUNCT__ promot reconcili through diplomaci __PUNCT__ stop nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ and address global warm __PUNCT__
we have to realiz that we ar in the middl of a sectarian civil war in iraq and that it is well past time to start withdraw our troop in the middl of that war __PUNCT__
and we must also realiz that the global threat of terror demand that we secur our home front __PUNCT__ take on the terrorist network abroad __PUNCT__ and combat a fals doctrin of hate __PUNCT__ death and destruct __PUNCT__
america must be the world leader and yet we cannot lead unless we restor the great and good of america in the ey of the world __PUNCT__
that why we must stand for freedom and fair __PUNCT__ justic and progress __PUNCT__ peac and secur __PUNCT__
let me sai a few word about iraq __PUNCT__
i know that cna ha releas a new report on iraq with a set of propos for the wai forward __PUNCT__
i have some differ with the specif of the propos __PUNCT__ but i believ it is time to end the war and bring our troop home as soon as possibl __PUNCT__
the fail ideolog and flaw decis make that led us into iraq ha had a devast impact on us here at home and around the world __PUNCT__
iraq continu to steal young american live and to consum __MONEY__ billion a month __PUNCT__ sap our militari readi and stand __PUNCT__
i travel to iraq three time to meet with soldier and command as well as the iraqi polit leader __PUNCT__
there is no doubt that our militari ha perform heroic and ha done what thei were ask to do accord to the author that wa pass nearli five year ago __PUNCT__
not a dai goe by that i don't think of our men and women who ar over there right now __PUNCT__ patrol the street of baghdad __PUNCT__ mosul __PUNCT__ and other place __PUNCT__ trap by a fail strategi and sectarian civil war and i never stop think about the live that have been lost and the live that have been so drastic affect by profound injuri __PUNCT__
the presid claim he listen to our militari command __PUNCT__ but he appar doesn't hear what i have heard for sever year now __PUNCT__
gener petraeu __PUNCT__ gener casei __PUNCT__ gener pace __PUNCT__ gener abizaid __PUNCT__ admir fallon and other have told him and us __PUNCT__ there is no militari solut to the iraq conflict __PUNCT__ onli a polit on __PUNCT__
without concert u.s. __PUNCT__ led intern polit and diplomat effort __PUNCT__ as the iraq studi group support but the bush administr disregard __PUNCT__ ani iraqi govern is condemn to failur __PUNCT__
in the absenc of credibl and strong incent back by u. __PUNCT__ pressur __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern ha degener into protect ethnic and sectarian interest __PUNCT__
in the absenc of sustain diplomat effort involv the parti affect and the nation in the region __PUNCT__ we risk the expans of the conflict beyond the border of iraq __PUNCT__
the coalit build effort dure the first gulf war and affect the former yugoslavia demonstr that sustain polit and diplomat effort ar critic to establish and maintain u. __PUNCT__ nation secur interest __PUNCT__
what work for the first bush administr and the clinton administr ha been abandon or execut poorli __PUNCT__
it is not a matter of partisanship __PUNCT__ it is a matter of learn from lesson of success american statesmanship of both democrat and republican presid __PUNCT__
the catalog of misjudg offend common sens and shock the conscienc __PUNCT__ the unilater decis to rush to war without allow inspector to finish their work or diplomaci to run it cours __PUNCT__ the failur to send enough troop and the disgrac lack of equip for those we sent __PUNCT__ the drain of manpow __PUNCT__ resourc and intellig capabl from afghanistan __PUNCT__ the inabl to stop riot or to secur weapon cach __PUNCT__ dismantl iraq secur and government capac __PUNCT__ the ignor of a rise insurg __PUNCT__ and the adher __PUNCT__ which continu to the present dai __PUNCT__ to a broken polici more than four year after the invas began __PUNCT__
sinc __NUM__ i call for the strateg redeploy of u. __PUNCT__ forc out of iraq __PUNCT__
i introduc the iraq troop protect and reduct act to begin withdraw our troop __PUNCT__
and i continu to press for a basic three step approach that would end the war while preserv our secur interest __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ start bring the troop home now __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ demand __PUNCT__ and back up those demand __PUNCT__ that the iraqi take respons for their countri or lose the aid we ar provid them __PUNCT__
and third __PUNCT__ begin intens region and intern diplomaci on a sustain basi __PUNCT__
we need to forc the administr to chang it fail polici in iraq __PUNCT__
that why i gone further and with senat robert byrd propos de __PUNCT__ author the war by __DATE__ the five year anniversari of the origin us of forc resolut __PUNCT__
senat byrd and i plan to offer an amend de __PUNCT__ author the war when the senat consid the defens author bill after the __DATE__ recess __PUNCT__
it a civil war in iraq and we must extric ourselv from it __PUNCT__
i also call on both the secretari of defens __PUNCT__ secretari gate __PUNCT__ and gener pace __PUNCT__ to brief congress on the exist plan for the withdraw of us troop from iraq or to explain why no such detail plan exist __PUNCT__
the seed of mani problem that continu to plagu our troop and mission in iraq were plant in a failur to adequ plan for the conflict that the administr wa so anxiou to begin __PUNCT__
we cannot allow our failur in deploi into iraq to be repeat when we redeploi out of iraq __PUNCT__
among the most import reason for extric ourselv from iraq ar the loom challeng in the region and around the world to our nation secur __PUNCT__
there is a global threat of terror and we have to confront it __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ the polici of the bush administr have set us back __PUNCT__
america must reli on the intellig of our alli along with our own __PUNCT__ yet the bush administr polici have alien our friend and embolden our enemi __PUNCT__
new threat requir us to modern and reform our intellig servic __PUNCT__
and we find ourselv often trap in veri short __PUNCT__ sight __PUNCT__ unproduct debat trigger by the presid and vice presid desir to expand execut author beyond ani previous imagin limit __PUNCT__
it is danger for us to be caught up in debat about wiretap scheme and it is danger for the administr to refus to disavow tortur __PUNCT__
we ar in a long term struggl in which our valu must be more than rhetor __PUNCT__
but we ar weaken by guantanamo and abu ghraib and by thi administr polici on detaine and tortur __PUNCT__
i vote against the militari commiss act becaus i believ we have to stand for the rule of law befor the world __PUNCT__ especi when we ar under threat __PUNCT__
democrat and republican alik believ that terrorist have to be caught __PUNCT__ captur __PUNCT__ sentenc __PUNCT__ punish __PUNCT__ kill __PUNCT__
i believ there should be no merci for those who perpetr __NUM__ and other crime against human __PUNCT__
but in the process of accomplish what is essenti for our secur we must hold onto our valu and set an exampl we can point to with pride and not shame __PUNCT__
the bill allow the admiss into evid of statement deriv from cruel __PUNCT__ inhuman __PUNCT__ and degrad interrog __PUNCT__
will our enemi be less like to surrend __PUNCT__ will inform be less like to come forward __PUNCT__ will our soldier be more like face tortur themselv if captur __PUNCT__ will the inform we obtain be less reliabl __PUNCT__ as lieuten __PUNCT__ gener __PUNCT__ john f __PUNCT__ kimmon __PUNCT__ the armi deputi chief of staff for intellig ha said __PUNCT__ no good intellig is go to come from abus interrog practic __PUNCT__
allow coerciv treatment and tortur action toward prison violat the rule of law __PUNCT__ fail in intellig gather __PUNCT__ and promot radic __PUNCT__
al __PUNCT__ zawahri __PUNCT__ osama bin laden second __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ command __PUNCT__ the architect of mani of the attack on our countri __PUNCT__ throughout europ and the world ha said over and over again if we would onli pai attent __PUNCT__ it is on their websit __PUNCT__ that tortur help the caus of extrem __PUNCT__ water the seed of jihad __PUNCT__
i call for the close of the prison at guantanamo bai becaus it repres in the ey of the world abus __PUNCT__ secreci __PUNCT__ and contempt for the rule of law __PUNCT__
rather than keep us more secur __PUNCT__ guantanamo is harm our nation secur __PUNCT__
it compromis our long __PUNCT__ term militari and strateg interest and impair our stand oversea __PUNCT__
we also cannot allow the failur take place in iraq to caus us to lose focu on the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
the first time i visit afghanistan in __NUM__ a young soldier said to me __PUNCT__ welcom to the forgotten front line of the war against terror __PUNCT__
thi administr is not onli fail in iraq __PUNCT__ it inattent risk failur in afghanistan __PUNCT__
dure my visit to afghanistan last __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i heard disturb report about continu cross border infiltr from pakistan into afghanistan by taliban and al __PUNCT__ qaeda fighter __PUNCT__
the tension between the afghan and pakistani govern were palpabl __PUNCT__
dure my meet with presid karzai and presid musharraf __PUNCT__ i ask if thei thought that a special presidenti envoi from the unit state would help them resolv their disput and thei both express the belief that such an envoi could be veri us __PUNCT__
when i return to the unit state __PUNCT__ i call the white hous to suggest a special envoi and to convei the reaction of presid karzai and musharraf __PUNCT__
the white hous __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ did not follow up on thi idea and the tension between those two critic countri continu unab __PUNCT__
we must widen the scope of our strength by lead strong allianc which can appli militari forc when requir and promot our valu __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ peopl were look toward america for leadership __PUNCT__
when ethnic cleans wa take place in the balkan __PUNCT__ the unit state led our european alli in put togeth a coalit to stop it __PUNCT__
there is no better wai to combat anti __PUNCT__ american than to do our best to demonstr that america is invest in lift up peopl around the world __PUNCT__
some of you have heard thi befor __PUNCT__ but it wa strike to me that after presid bush ask hi father and my husband to repres our countri with respect to the relief follow the tsunami __PUNCT__ thei travel togeth __PUNCT__ thei were there when our militari wa evacu peopl and bring in suppli __PUNCT__ and the public opinion about the unit state increas dramat in a posit direct base on that veri visibl show of american concern __PUNCT__ most notabl in indonesia where there had been track of public attitud toward us befor and after __PUNCT__
instabl and extrem fester in place where infrastructur __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and opportun ar also lack __PUNCT__
i introduc the educ for all act to provid __MONEY__ billion over five year toward the goal of basic educ for everi boi and girl around the world __PUNCT__
from pakistan to sudan __PUNCT__ parent want their children to have an educ __PUNCT__ but too often govern fail in deliv that basic servic or find themselv without the resourc to do so even if thei ar will __PUNCT__
educ is a tool to combat hiv/aid __PUNCT__ empow women __PUNCT__ and certainli for econom develop __PUNCT__
and i believ all of that plai to our strength __PUNCT__
for six year __PUNCT__ the threat of terror at home ha not been met successfulli with a lot of bluster and intimid __PUNCT__ that onli isol us __PUNCT__
it not right and it not smart __PUNCT__
the attack which have been prevent ar a result of cooper with other nation in intellig __PUNCT__ law enforc and monei track effort __PUNCT__
and those kind of cooper relationship have to be deepen and strengthen __PUNCT__
allianc ar also essenti in safeguard against other secur threat like pandem __PUNCT__ be thei act of terror or act of god __PUNCT__
and there need to be better cooper global for us to be prepar to deal with these kind of threat __PUNCT__
i think it import that we also focu on the most signific threat of all __PUNCT__ nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ public discours project __PUNCT__ an outgrowth of the __NUM__ commiss __PUNCT__ argu that __PUNCT__ prevent terrorist from gain weapon of mass destruct must be elev abov all other problem of nation secur becaus it repres the greatest threat to the american peopl __PUNCT__
we wouldn't know it by the discuss and dialogu in thi citi __PUNCT__
the bush administr ha join the choru sai that __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ that is our biggest threat __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ their respons ha founder at a nexu of ideolog and intransig __PUNCT__
thei have follow a polici that permit north korea __PUNCT__ whose plutonium product wa frozen by the last administr __PUNCT__ to reprocess enough materi in the last four year to make half a dozen nuclear bomb and test a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
in the past few month we seen sign of revers __PUNCT__ but the damag is alreadi done __PUNCT__
iran __PUNCT__ meanwhil __PUNCT__ ha been given six year of the silent treatment __PUNCT__
in thi vacuum __PUNCT__ iran continu it progress toward develop nuclear weapon and increas it influenc in the region __PUNCT__
after initi talk with iran and syria on iraq __PUNCT__ the administr sai it isn't sure that we need ani more discuss with either of them __PUNCT__
i think we should keep talk __PUNCT__
rather than engag those who seek to develop nuclear weapon and work more urgent with alli to secur the nuclear materi that al qaeda and other covet __PUNCT__ the administr ha abandon the comprehens test ban treati and neglect non __PUNCT__ prolifer and even promot two new small nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ includ the robust nuclear earth penetr __PUNCT__ the so __PUNCT__ call bunker buster __PUNCT__
i introduc the nuclear terror prevent act __PUNCT__ a bill base on the report publish by the nuclear threat initi __PUNCT__ head by senat sam nunn __PUNCT__
he clearli see thi threat __PUNCT__ outrun our respons __PUNCT__
and my bill seek to reinvigor and acceler our effort to ensur that the natur and urgenc of our respons is commensur with the threat __PUNCT__
my legisl would first devot real resourc to combat the threat by increas fund for the global threat reduct initi to convert research reactor around the world from highli enrich uranium to low enrich uranium and to remov the highli enrich uranium from such facil __PUNCT__
i wa with warren buffett last night who ha pledg __MONEY__ million of hi own monei to thi effort and believ that he could amass an even greater amount of monei from the privat sector if our govern would lead us with some urgenc toward take on thi challeng __PUNCT__
we need to expand the materi protect __PUNCT__ control and account program to lock down nuclear materi and invest in forens measur which advanc our abil to discov the origin of a nuclear weapon in the horrif event of an attack __PUNCT__
thi legisl would also requir the presid to work to creat specif intern guidelin to rais the secur standard at foreign nuclear site __PUNCT__
to paraphras harvard graham allison __PUNCT__ no access to nuclear materi mean no nuclear terror __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ to coordin these effort __PUNCT__ my legisl would creat a senior advisor to the presid for the prevent of nuclear terror __PUNCT__ respons for an annual report to congress list all site worldwid with nuclear weapon and weapon __PUNCT__ usabl fissil materi and for develop and coordin the implement of a plan to elimin __PUNCT__ remov and secur all such materi __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ we will never be serv by polici that isol us from those who can be our alli in stop prolifer __PUNCT__
and i hope that we will turn to thi with greater urgenc now __PUNCT__
we cannot wait __NUM__ month for the next administr __PUNCT__
we should be focus on do as much as possibl as quickli as we can __PUNCT__
there ar so mani other challeng across the board from obvious the middl east to latin america __PUNCT__ from the ongo isra __PUNCT__ palestinian conflict to the ongo violenc in darfur __PUNCT__
the next presid will face a rise china with grow econom __PUNCT__ diplomat and militari power __PUNCT__
china is us it power throughout the world in new wai that challeng our current think and polici __PUNCT__
we should neither fear a stronger china nor ignor it __PUNCT__
that mean engag and understand __PUNCT__ but also frank dialogu on issu rang from trade to currenc manipul to human right abus and the environ __PUNCT__
i rememb travel to china in __NUM__ to repres the unit state at the fourth world confer on women __PUNCT__
shortli befor the confer wa to start __PUNCT__ the chines govern imprison a dissid __PUNCT__ as some of you might rememb __PUNCT__ and mani felt that we shouldn't go in order to send a strong messag of disapprov __PUNCT__
but i thought we should send anoth messag __PUNCT__
that why i did go and spoke out about the import of human right and particularli emphas the import of women right __PUNCT__
i don't think we lose by speak out and engag with those with whom we disagre __PUNCT__ even in profound wai __PUNCT__
latin america present anoth challeng __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i think we have ignor develop in latin america at our peril __PUNCT__
the presid came into offic with great promis but unfortun it ha not been realiz __PUNCT__
and we must redoubl our effort to creat better ti and look for specif project of develop that can perhap make a differ __PUNCT__
the clinton foundat just announc a __MONEY__ million fund to do just that in latin america __PUNCT__ work for sustain develop and work to train peopl to do job connect with sustain develop __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we face seriou challeng in africa __PUNCT__
in sudan __PUNCT__ zimbabw and other countri long __PUNCT__ term conflict __PUNCT__ extern and intern __PUNCT__ persist __PUNCT__
certainli in the horn of africa we see islamist extremist attempt to lai down root __PUNCT__
and we ar watch the chines gain influenc __PUNCT__ build soccer stadium and parliament build __PUNCT__
the pentagon is creat a separ command for africa __PUNCT__ and i fulli support that __PUNCT__ but thei have a problem figur out where to place it __PUNCT__ becaus the countri of north africa ar not welcom us the wai that i believ thei would have at a previou period __PUNCT__
we seen what happen when we fail to focu on africa __PUNCT__
the genocid in darfur is a prime exampl __PUNCT__
the unit nation must do more to hold it member countri respons for meet basic human right standard __PUNCT__
and the unit state must do more to creat an environ in which countri ar will to place their resourc at the dispos of the mission to end genocid __PUNCT__
we got to look for wai that we can creat these opportun within darfur __PUNCT__
if sudan doe not live up to it commit to allow a full hybrid u.n __PUNCT__ and african union peacekeep forc __PUNCT__ we should work with nato to take militari action __PUNCT__
i would suggest a no __PUNCT__ fly zone that would be blanket over darfur and be focus on the air support that the sudanes provid to the janjawe as thei rape and pillag their wai through the villag __PUNCT__ the bomb come befor __PUNCT__ dure and after __PUNCT__
and i think it is time for us to make a much more seriou effort both to support the troop on the ground with airlift and logist __PUNCT__ and to have the threat of the no __PUNCT__ fly zone and action taken against those who violat it __PUNCT__ in order for thi new effort that the u.n __PUNCT__ and the a.u __PUNCT__ ar proceed with to be success __PUNCT__
but there ar some good new stori in africa that we got to do more to support __PUNCT__ and i particularli am pleas about liberia __PUNCT__
we seen the veri impress presid of presid ellen johnson __PUNCT__ sirleaf __PUNCT__
her commit to good govern ha serv as a real exampl __PUNCT__
we have support debt relief for liberia __PUNCT__ and the congress is pass that insofar as the american portion of it __PUNCT__
but we got to do more to help the countri rebuild __PUNCT__ and to try to creat some exampl of good govern and posit develop in africa with our help __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ there global warm __PUNCT__ a particular challeng that ha secur implic __PUNCT__
eleven retir three __PUNCT__ and four __PUNCT__ star admir __PUNCT__ and gener __PUNCT__ includ gener zinni __PUNCT__ had come out with a report entitl __PUNCT__ nation secur and the threat of climat chang __PUNCT__
it conclud that global warm did present a seriou nation secur threat becaus of it project impact on reduc access to fresh water and impair food product __PUNCT__ the displac of popul __PUNCT__ the mass migrat that will occur __PUNCT__ the fail state __PUNCT__ the conflict over scarc resourc __PUNCT__
i author an amend for the defens author bill to implement mani of the recommend of thi report __PUNCT__
it is not the first on __PUNCT__
the pentagon actual did their own report __PUNCT__ sever year ago __PUNCT__ which never saw the light of dai to ani great extent __PUNCT__
and it is time that we clearli focu on global warm as a secur challeng __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ there is a challeng we face right here at home in try to figur out how to rebuild our militari and transform our govern to face the threat of the __NUM__ centuri and to take advantag of the opportun __PUNCT__
i a member of the transform advisori group __PUNCT__ which is a part of the u. __PUNCT__ joint forc command __PUNCT__
i wa ask to join sever year ago __PUNCT__
it a uniqu advisori group __PUNCT__ charg with think of new idea to move our militari and govern into a more forward lean __PUNCT__ forward think postur __PUNCT__
and it import that we look at the lesson from thi group discuss __PUNCT__ that it not just about what the militari can and must do __PUNCT__ but how the rest of the govern ha to be valu __PUNCT__ ad and work togeth in a much more coordin wai __PUNCT__
our increasingli interconnect world demand an interconnect strategi that take into account polit __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ diplomat and militari concern __PUNCT__
when develop militari strategi __PUNCT__ our militari leader no longer speak of the battlefield __PUNCT__ but thei talk about the situat __PUNCT__
thei ar much more adept than mani peopl actual understand __PUNCT__ that the battlespac goe far beyond the battlefield __PUNCT__
and we need that kind of multidimension think __PUNCT__ both insid and outsid the wall of the pentagon __PUNCT__
so let make an effort to increas the number of soldier profici in foreign languag __PUNCT__ instead of kick out interpret who happen to be gai __PUNCT__
let be sure our polici reflect concern for the will of govern and the percept of peopl __PUNCT__
let make sure that we look just not at the quadrenni defens review but at a document that look at all of the govern respons to the threat and opportun we face __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ despit the profess attempt at militari transform __PUNCT__ much more need to be done __PUNCT__
we do need to increas the size of the armi to address the myriad threat that we still face __PUNCT__ even after we begin withdraw from iraq __PUNCT__
we need to reform the pentagon acquisit system to rein in the cost of weapon system and spend on outsid contractor __PUNCT__
and we need to find the right mix between legaci system that our servic member ar current us and newer program that will allow us to keep our technolog __URL__ experi in iraq and afghanistan mean that we must not just learn but incorpor the lesson of asymmetr warfar and train and equip our forc __URL__ we need to re __PUNCT__ evalu the entir train and educ that servic member need in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
everi challeng we face begin with the biggest challeng __PUNCT__ restor our leadership by onc again valu allianc __PUNCT__ respect our valu __PUNCT__ and understand that american strength is more than just a show of forc __PUNCT__
i want to end with a stori that i particularli like __PUNCT__ in part becaus it realli doe remind me of all that america can be when we have leadership that understand all that america should be __PUNCT__
it a stori that secretari albright ha told __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ she wa ask to go to europ to commemor the __NUM__ anniversari of the end of world war ii __PUNCT__
and she wa particularli excit about go becaus she would go to the czech republ __PUNCT__ have been born and rais in the former czechoslovakia and have confront nazism and commun through her famili __PUNCT__
so as she travel around to these variou commemor __PUNCT__ she notic peopl wave american flag __PUNCT__
but as she look more close __PUNCT__ she realiz those flag had onli __NUM__ star __PUNCT__
and she kept ask peopl __PUNCT__ where did these flag come from __PUNCT__ and everyon told her the same thing __PUNCT__ when the american g.i. liber europ __PUNCT__ thei pass out these flag __PUNCT__
and peopl had treasur them __PUNCT__ pass them on from grandpar to parent to child __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ keep them at some risk to themselv __PUNCT__ becaus if thei been discov under soviet occup with an american flag __PUNCT__ thei could have gotten into troubl __PUNCT__
so she ask them __PUNCT__ why did you keep these flag for fifti year __PUNCT__ and everyon said the same thing __PUNCT__ becaus thei love america and thei love the hope that those flag repres and the valu that stood behind them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i want to see a restor of those feel about us around the world __PUNCT__
but i also want to see their restor here at home __PUNCT__
we have to begin believ again in our good and our great __PUNCT__ in our abil to be both smart and tough __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago thi month __PUNCT__ presid kennedi spoke just a short distanc from where we ar todai at american univers __PUNCT__
and he said __PUNCT__ i speak of peac becaus of the new face of war __PUNCT__
in thi new centuri __PUNCT__ we ar confront by yet anoth new face of war and a new realiti of global interdepend __PUNCT__
it is a moment of peril and of promis __PUNCT__
how we proce is entir up to us __PUNCT__
we can repair the damag that ha been done to our secur and our stand over these past six year __PUNCT__
we can rebuild our allianc and restor our moral author __PUNCT__ and reestablish our leadership in the world __PUNCT__
and by do so __PUNCT__ we can forg a new american secur for thi new centuri __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
