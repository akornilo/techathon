and thei ar an urgent issu for america __PUNCT__ becaus america will never achiev our potenti until all american can achiev their __PUNCT__
now obvious we have come a long wai in thi countri __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ we have our work cut out for us if we go to keep the promis that we should __PUNCT__ that we will continu to work for a more perfect union that includ america __PUNCT__
for the past seven year __PUNCT__ it as though peopl with disabl have been invis to thi presid and hi administr __PUNCT__
if you a child who can't get the special educ class you need __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you a citizen who want to vote __PUNCT__ but the poll place doesn't have the right equip or the right help __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you a worker want a job __PUNCT__ but can't find on that accommod your disabl __PUNCT__ you invis too __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ peopl with disabl mai be invis to georg bush __PUNCT__ but thei ar not invis to you __PUNCT__ and thei will never be invis to me __PUNCT__
thi is a caus i been involv with for throughout my __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
my first job out of law school wa with the children defens fund __PUNCT__
i did not want to go to work for big law firm __PUNCT__
i didn't want to work for feder judg __PUNCT__
i want to work on behalf of children __PUNCT__
i wa assign to go to new bedford __PUNCT__ massachusett as part of a nationwid effort to understand why so mani children were not enrol in school __PUNCT__
and how did we know that __PUNCT__ becaus we had censu figur of how mani children there were in a commun between the ag of five and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and we had school enrol figur __PUNCT__
and thei didn't match __PUNCT__
where were those children __PUNCT__ knock on those door wa ey __PUNCT__ open and heart __PUNCT__ break experi __PUNCT__
i found children who weren't in school becaus of physic disabl like blind and deaf __PUNCT__
on the small back porch off her famili home __PUNCT__ i met a girl in a wheelchair who told me how much she want to go to school __PUNCT__
but she knew she couldn't go __PUNCT__ simpli becaus she couldn't walk __PUNCT__
these children were kept home becaus the school couldn't __PUNCT__ and wouldn't __PUNCT__ accommod them __PUNCT__
thei want to learn __PUNCT__
thei want to succe __PUNCT__
but thei never had the chanc __PUNCT__
i knew then that i want to spend my life fight to be a voic for children who had been left out and left behind __PUNCT__
i want to give them the same opportun i had grow up __PUNCT__
the children defens fund submit our result to the congress __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ with the help of strong leader like senat kennedi __PUNCT__ and all of you who ar advoc __PUNCT__ it led to the individu with disabl educ act __PUNCT__ mandat that children with physic __PUNCT__ emot and learn disabl be educ in the public school system __PUNCT__
my work on thi issu came full circl __PUNCT__ when as a senat __PUNCT__ when i help write the idea reauthor act in __NUM__ to ensur we have target resourc dedic to teacher train __PUNCT__
in the senat __PUNCT__ i have also work to pass the commun choic act __PUNCT__ which will final __PUNCT__ we hope __PUNCT__ elimin the institut bia in our medicar and medicaid system __PUNCT__
i have aggress fought to investig the linkag between environment toxin and disabl __PUNCT__
and i have strongli support the ada restor act __PUNCT__ and look forward to sign it into law as presid __PUNCT__ and you all invit to the sign ceremoni when i am presid __PUNCT__ my white hous will welcom you __PUNCT__
our govern will be a partner with you __PUNCT__
and new opportun will be open to you __PUNCT__
i have laid out an agenda to increas employ among peopl with disabl __PUNCT__
these reform ar long overdu __PUNCT__
american with disabl have half the employ rate and doubl the poverti rate of those without disabl __PUNCT__
even those who have graduat from colleg work at onli two __PUNCT__ third the rate of other __PUNCT__
we need to provid more opportun for peopl with disabl to break into the middl class __PUNCT__ not just to surviv __PUNCT__ but to thrive __PUNCT__
on of my first act will be to reinstat my husband execut order that commit the feder govern to hire __NUM__ peopl with disabl __PUNCT__
presid bush wa wrong to abandon that commit __PUNCT__ and i go to get us back on track __PUNCT__
i also doubl our invest in work __PUNCT__ enabl technolog __PUNCT__ by provid more low interest loan for purchas them __PUNCT__
i provid real __PUNCT__ time support for employ so thei can make the accommod necessari for their employe to do their job __PUNCT__
i want to also propos __PUNCT__ and work to pass __PUNCT__ a __MONEY__ per worker tax credit to offset the expens of work and transport for worker with disabl __PUNCT__
in addit to the posit agenda that i will pursu __PUNCT__ i want to get rid of the disincent for work in so mani feder program __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ peopl with disabl can lose their social secur disabl insur __PUNCT__ their supplement secur incom __PUNCT__ their medicar __PUNCT__ and medicaid benefit when thei earn even a tini salari __PUNCT__
that is absolut upsid __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__
so just think about it __PUNCT__
it make no sens __PUNCT__
even if you can work and want to work __PUNCT__ there a penalti if you try to work __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that believ in work and we want peopl to make a contribut __PUNCT__
we believ it in the individu interest __PUNCT__ as well as the countri __PUNCT__
that bad for taxpay __PUNCT__ it unfair to peopl with disabl __PUNCT__ and we need to end it onc and for all __PUNCT__
on of the proudest accomplish of the clinton administr wa to sign the ticket to work and work and the work incent improv act into law __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ __NUM__ state have enact polici to reduc the disincent to work __PUNCT__
that signific progress __PUNCT__ but state polici ar still uneven __PUNCT__
that why we need to move at the feder level __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i help work individu with disabl bui __PUNCT__ in to medicaid __PUNCT__ elimin the medicar elig time limit on the number of year an individu can work __PUNCT__ and conduct a review to determin where disincent to work still exist in feder benefit program and where we can and must do better __PUNCT__
i think we can break down these barrier to employ and empow peopl with disabl to find the job and career that ar fulfil and import to them and the rest of us __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i want to mention my health care plan __PUNCT__
it call the american health choic plan and it ha real signific for peopl with disabl __PUNCT__
my health care plan will let you keep your exist coverag if you ar satisfi with it __PUNCT__ but it provid afford choic if you don't have coverag or you ar dissatisfi __PUNCT__
and it cover everi singl american __PUNCT__
everyon will have access to the same choic member of congress have now __PUNCT__
we have a congression plan that cover member of congress and feder employe __PUNCT__
it work pretti well and you pai for it __PUNCT__
it provid more than __NUM__ option and it ha a lower cost than you find through most employ and certainli on your own in the marketplac __PUNCT__
i believ if it good enough for member of congress __PUNCT__ it good enough for you and everi other american __PUNCT__
and under my plan __PUNCT__ you will never be deni coverag becaus of pre __PUNCT__ exist condit or risk factor __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ health insur compani spend __MONEY__ billion a year try to figur out how not to cover peopl __PUNCT__
i mean that their busi model __PUNCT__
thei claim thei in the health insur busi __PUNCT__ but thei realli in the health no insur busi __PUNCT__
thei try to avoid cover peopl __PUNCT__ and then if thei some how get caught __PUNCT__ and thei actual cover you __PUNCT__ thei try to avoid pai for the servic that you receiv __PUNCT__
i think that wrong __PUNCT__
and i offer a new busi plan __PUNCT__
and in fact __PUNCT__ i go to save them a fortun __PUNCT__
becaus here the new polici __PUNCT__ more discrimin __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
cover everybodi __PUNCT__
my plan requir insur compani to compet base on cost and qualiti __PUNCT__ not how skillfulli thei can exclud patient with the greatest medic need __PUNCT__
we also go to start cover prevent __PUNCT__
i believ we can actual avoid some disabl if we provid prevent __PUNCT__
the clearest exampl of that is that govern and health insur plan __PUNCT__ rare pai for a visit to a podiatrist for a diabet __PUNCT__
but thei pai for the amput of the foot __PUNCT__
therefor we have a creat a disabl instead of prevent a disabl __PUNCT__
and there ar mani other exampl that i could through in the absolut backward wai that the health care system current oper __PUNCT__
my health plan __PUNCT__ my disabl agenda __PUNCT__ and all of the polici i put forward have on unifi principl __PUNCT__ that we all in thi togeth and it time to start act like it again __PUNCT__
i do not believ in the bush republican polici of you in thi on your own __PUNCT__
thei call it the ownership societi __PUNCT__
and thei ar try to put the entir burden of cope with all of life unpredict event on the individu __PUNCT__
that wa what wa behind their attempt to privat social secur __PUNCT__
that is what is behind their effort to cut back on support from other system that enabl peopl to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
well i believ that whenev anyon in america can't live up to hi or her potenti that diminish all of us __PUNCT__
and we ow all of our peopl wise __PUNCT__ sensibl polici that recogn the digniti __PUNCT__ the valu __PUNCT__ and the human of their all american __PUNCT__
i know that what most american believ __PUNCT__
we just need our polit system onc again to show the leadership necessari to make it happen __PUNCT__
i am excit by my campaign becaus of the broad support i am receiv across new hampshir __PUNCT__
but i know we have a veri tough two month plu to go __PUNCT__
and i go to do everyth i can to travel thi state to meet with as mani citizen as possibl to answer your question __PUNCT__
but on thing i that am proud to be repres is the chang that american deserv to have __PUNCT__
now chang is just a word unless you have the strength and experi to make it happen __PUNCT__
but i don't ani peopl who ar stronger __PUNCT__ than peopl with disabl __PUNCT__ who get up everi singl dai and do the best thei can __PUNCT__ reach out to other __PUNCT__ and i want to recogn that strength __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ kind is call for from all of us to on anoth __PUNCT__
i believ that we got to get back to treat each other with that sens of recognit and respect __PUNCT__
but never forget that justic is at the core of the american dream __PUNCT__
and we must onc again stand for just here at home and around the world __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
