clinton __PUNCT__ and everywher i go across pennsylvania __PUNCT__ i in harrisburg right now __PUNCT__
about __NUM__ dai ago __PUNCT__ i met with some independ trucker who ar go to forc out of busi if these ga price continu to rise __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ i wa in johnstown __PUNCT__ introduc by a man who said he didn't know what he wa go to do becaus hi truck had cost __MONEY__ to fill up __PUNCT__
and it is becom a huge econom crisi for most american __PUNCT__
here what i would do if i were presid right now __PUNCT__
number on __PUNCT__ i would investig these price __PUNCT__
i not satisfi at all that there isn't ani manipul go on or price __PUNCT__ goug __PUNCT__
i still rememb dure the enron scandal find out that there were trader in energi who were deliber manipul the market so that consum in california __PUNCT__ oregon and washington paid higher electr price __PUNCT__
i would also releas some of the oil from the strateg petroleum reserv __PUNCT__ which would help bring down the price __PUNCT__
it usual doe __PUNCT__
i would also consid a ga tax holidai __PUNCT__ if we could make up the lost revenu from the highwai trust fund __PUNCT__
and my suggest would be a windfal profit tax on the oil compani __PUNCT__
thei been make record profit in the last year __PUNCT__
but i would also do someth els __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i would make it absolut clear that the unit state wa not go to be over the oil barrel ani longer __PUNCT__ that we were go to get seriou about energi independ __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__ if we did that __PUNCT__ if our presid said that tomorrow and realli meant it and work with congress to pass everi piec of legisl we need __PUNCT__ that he ha so far resist support __PUNCT__ the oil compani and the oil countri would drop the price __PUNCT__ becaus thei would want to lull us back into a fals sens of secur __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ __URL__ that mayb we wouldn't follow through __PUNCT__
but thi time __PUNCT__ we must follow through __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ so all of the abov __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ all of the abov __PUNCT__
and it could be done tomorrow if the presid were will __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__

let look at a bit of it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip from hillari clinton for presid campaign ad __PUNCT__ unidentifi male __PUNCT__ it the toughest job in the world __PUNCT__
you need to be readi for anyth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ we saw bin laden there __PUNCT__
barack obama sai that you practic the polit of fear __PUNCT__
how do you respond to that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i am talk in that ad about the realiti __PUNCT__ that the next presid will inherit some of the most danger and difficult decis that ani presid ha had to make in a veri long time __PUNCT__
and i think it import that we have an elect that ask peopl to consid who thei would hire for the toughest job in the world __PUNCT__
we got two war __PUNCT__
we have to end the war in iraq and we need to win the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we got these spiral oil cost that ar realli hurt peopl __PUNCT__ an economi that in crisi __PUNCT__
i don't think there ani doubt in anyon mind that whoever we elect ha to be readi to take on these decis __PUNCT__
and we don't know what els might be out there wait __PUNCT__
and i want peopl to think serious about leadership __PUNCT__ becaus that what i offer in thi campaign __PUNCT__
i think i readi __PUNCT__
i have a uniqu set of qualif that will prepar me to step into that oval offic and __PUNCT__ on dai on __PUNCT__ be the command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief we need to end the war in iraq and to be the presid to turn the economi around __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ how do you respond __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ to the complaint that the campaign __PUNCT__ both campaign __PUNCT__ in a sens __PUNCT__ have gotten so neg __PUNCT__ robert reich __PUNCT__ the former labor secretari in your husband administr __PUNCT__ a longtim friend of your __PUNCT__ is on of the peopl who sai that he now back obama __PUNCT__
here what he told cnn __PUNCT__
i be interest in your comment __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ robert reich __PUNCT__ former secretari of labor __PUNCT__ but thi crescendo of neg mudsling from the clinton camp __PUNCT__ divert attent from the big issu thi countri face __PUNCT__
i just thought __PUNCT__ i can't be silent ani longer __PUNCT__
i got to take a stand and i got to follow my conscienc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ did that hurt you __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i don't think that he follow the campaign veri close __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ clearli __PUNCT__ there ha been a relentless seri of attack come from the other side __PUNCT__
i spent the vast major of thi campaign give veri specif speech about the solut that i offer on all of the import issu face our countri __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the press that cover me on a regular basi __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ is kind of bore __PUNCT__ becaus i just talk about solut and what we go to do to get more job and get health care for everyon and make sure we have a clean __PUNCT__ renew energi futur and all of the other concern that voter talk to me about __PUNCT__
but in the last __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ coupl of week __PUNCT__ senat obama campaign ha becom increasingli neg __PUNCT__
he sai on thing on the stump and hi campaign doe someth els __PUNCT__
i like noth better than to stai focus on the differ between our health care plan __PUNCT__
i have a plan that will get to univers health care and cover everyon and he doesn't __PUNCT__
i have a plan to end the home foreclosur crisi and i don't think hi measur up __PUNCT__
so i would be realli pleas to talk about a lot of the hard question that ar go to face the next presid __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ in a campaign __PUNCT__ it doe get sometim back __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ forth __PUNCT__
actual __PUNCT__ i think thi ha been __PUNCT__ on balanc __PUNCT__ a pretti civil and posit campaign __PUNCT__ compar to mani that we seen in the last year __PUNCT__
and it is fair to compar and contrast the differ between us __PUNCT__
and voter get to make up their own mind about __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ who thei can count on to make the veri difficult decis and bring about the posit result we need __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ it mai be percept then __PUNCT__
we have an e __PUNCT__ mail from collin in riverview __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ who sai __PUNCT__ i notic you start with the neg ad onc you fell behind in the nomin race __PUNCT__
so my question is __PUNCT__ do you think you be in content at thi point if you had not gone neg __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ you don't think you gone neg __PUNCT__
would you agre that a lot of the public think you have __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i don't know what the public think __PUNCT__
but i certainli believ that ani fair read of thi campaign __PUNCT__ the kind of thing that my oppon campaign ha said __PUNCT__ the kind of ad that thei and their alli have run __PUNCT__ the sort of phone call and mail __PUNCT__ rememb in ohio __PUNCT__ i had to call them out on the mislead __PUNCT__ neg mail that thei were send out about my health care plan and about my posit to chang and fix nafta __PUNCT__
and i think the peopl of ohio took a hard look at who wa be mislead and who wasn't __PUNCT__ and that why i won such an overwhelm vote in ohio __PUNCT__
so i can imagin the peopl who onli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ follow it from __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ some of the snippet on tv might __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ not be sure exactli who sai what and what the campaign ar do __PUNCT__
but the peopl in the state where we compet who follow it veri __PUNCT__ veri close __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ar well awar of __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ who is run what kind of ad and the fact that senat obama is outspend me three or four to on and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ liter just run ad around the clock __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ that all part of the campaign __PUNCT__
and at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ voter get to decid who thei think would be best suit to do the tough job that the next presid will face __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ and a big part of that decis will happen tomorrow __PUNCT__
senat clinton will be here right after the break __PUNCT__ where we ar just get __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ __URL__ a big on tomorrow __PUNCT__
we just get start __PUNCT__
stick around __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you elect a presid to solv problem __PUNCT__ not to give speech __PUNCT__
and that should be what we focus on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ the veri tough senat hillari clinton on the stump in pennsylvania __PUNCT__
the campaign __PUNCT__ the primari is tomorrow __PUNCT__
some sai __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i almost said hillari __PUNCT__ becaus i known you such a long time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ i left out the __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ ha __PUNCT__ ha __PUNCT__ we known each other a long time __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
that all right __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ that thi campaign ha been so rough that whoever win __PUNCT__ it go to be a pyhrric victori __PUNCT__ that the winner is go to lose in __DATE__ becaus you knock each other around so much __PUNCT__
a good chanc of that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i don't think so at all __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ by ani histor standard __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__ thi ha been a veri civil and posit campaign __PUNCT__
i know we both have veri intens support and peopl take thi campaign incred person __PUNCT__
but at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ we go to have a unifi democrat parti __PUNCT__
whatev differ there ar between my oppon and myself pale in comparison to the differ we have with senat mccain and the republican __PUNCT__
and the import question for democrat is who is stronger to actual go up against john mccain in the fall __PUNCT__ becaus i believ that the democrat parti __PUNCT__ the peopl who have turn out and vote __PUNCT__ will fall in behind our nomine __PUNCT__
and then it will be up to the nomine to make the case against a veri tough candid __PUNCT__
there is no doubt in my mind that the republican ar not go to give up the white hous without a terrif fight __PUNCT__
and i happen to believ that i better suit to go up against senat mccain __PUNCT__
but i said on mani occas __PUNCT__ i go to do whatev i can do to make sure we have a democrat presid in the white hous next __DATE__ __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ in a recent debat __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ you reiter it __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ that you thought barack obama could defeat mccain __PUNCT__
is he better prepar than mccain __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think he can win __PUNCT__ but i think i will win __PUNCT__
i realli believ that or i wouldn't be sit here talk to you __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ but is he better prepar __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__
from harrisburg __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think that he would be __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ is he a better prepar candid __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that go to be up to the voter to try to sort through __PUNCT__
lot of what senat mccain is sai is just wrong for the countri __PUNCT__
so it doesn't realli matter what credenti he offer __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ he ha veri extraordinari credenti __PUNCT__ with hi militari servic and hi servic in the senat __PUNCT__
but the bottom line is that hi polici ar wrong for america __PUNCT__
i don't think we want to continu georg bush polici in iraq __PUNCT__
and i sure don't think we want to follow along with what senat mccain said __PUNCT__ that he be happi if we had to have troop in iraq for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ if that what it took __PUNCT__
and i sure don't believ that peopl want to continu georg bush econom polici __PUNCT__ which have brought us these skyrocket ga price and increas cost for everyth and stagnant wage for most middl __PUNCT__ class american __PUNCT__
so senat mccain certainli will plai up hi credenti and he ha everi right to do so __PUNCT__
that who he is __PUNCT__
but at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ i want thi elect in the fall to be not a person contest __PUNCT__
it should be about what thi person will do come the time when thei sworn in as the presid __PUNCT__
rememb __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl mai have been taken in by georg bush back in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
he ran as a compassion conserv __PUNCT__
and i not sure peopl realli understood or even knew what that meant __PUNCT__
and mani peopl have been sore disappoint at the outcom __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thi elect in the fall need to be between the republican and the democrat candid __PUNCT__ toe __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ toe on nation secur __PUNCT__ take them to task over the economi __PUNCT__ stand up for univers health care __PUNCT__ talk about the issu that matter here at home and around the world __PUNCT__
and i believ that i am the better candid to do that __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ senat mccain said __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ on thi program __PUNCT__ that he a good friend of your __PUNCT__
is that true __PUNCT__ ar you friendli in the senat and out of the senat __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ we ar friend __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ i deepli respect senat mccain and hi servic and patriot __PUNCT__
we gone to iraq and afghanistan togeth __PUNCT__
we work on behalf of a sensibl polici to deal with global warm __PUNCT__
so i enjoi hi compani __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ i go to ask him to come over to the white hous quit often and take trip with me __PUNCT__ becaus he ha a perspect __PUNCT__
i don't agre with it and i think that he the wrong person to be presid at thi time __PUNCT__ but we friend and we remain friend __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ ar you sai if you presid __PUNCT__ you would us senat mccain __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i go to reach out to republican __PUNCT__ all kind of republican __PUNCT__ becaus i think it import that we try to have a bipartisan foreign polici __PUNCT__
i have veri strong convict about what we should do __PUNCT__ but i go to listen and enlist republican __PUNCT__ as well as democrat __PUNCT__ not onli elect on __PUNCT__ but distinguish american of both parti __PUNCT__
we have a lot of repair work to do in the world __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i would ask peopl to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ realli help me restor american leadership __PUNCT__
i like to have a bipartisan foreign polici __PUNCT__
i think it been unfortun that the presid and the vice presid have been so partisan in their pursuit __PUNCT__ wrongli __PUNCT__ of the goal that thei have had in foreign polici __PUNCT__
so a lot of peopl in the senat that i don't agre with on mani issu will have __PUNCT__ and at differ set and on differ concern __PUNCT__ a lot to contribut to america __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ so mayb a republican or two in the cabinet __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i think we should look at that __PUNCT__
we need to try to have a bipartisan govern __PUNCT__
we got to restor confid and compet to the american govern __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ dure __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the american peopl actual have to believ that their presid can solv problem for them __PUNCT__
that why i spent so much time in thi campaign talk about be a problem solver and a chang maker __PUNCT__ somebodi with a proven track record of experi in do that __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
dure the campaign __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ you constantli tout yourself as the candid with experi __PUNCT__ been through fire __PUNCT__ know how washington work __PUNCT__
senat obama frame your experi thi wai __PUNCT__
watch __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ here is __PUNCT__ essenti __PUNCT__ senat clinton argument __PUNCT__
her basic argument in thi elect __PUNCT__ and it becom clearer as time goe on __PUNCT__ is that you can't realli chang washington __PUNCT__
you can't realli chang the sai anyth __PUNCT__ do anyth __PUNCT__ special interest driven game in washington __PUNCT__
and becaus you can't chang it __PUNCT__ you might as well select somebodi who know how to plai the game better becaus thei been at the game longer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ doe he have a point __PUNCT__ that you __PUNCT__ can you chang the system you been a part of for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think that most of our great presid who actual produc transform chang have been involv in the polit life of our countri __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ senat obama wa in the state senat about three and a half year ago __PUNCT__
and i wa in the senat of the unit state __PUNCT__ work on a lot of these issu __PUNCT__
i repres chang __PUNCT__
the fact that i am __PUNCT__ as a woman __PUNCT__ compet to becom the presid of the unit state would be an extraordinari chang __PUNCT__
but it also more than that __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
i taken on the special interest __PUNCT__
it easi to talk about it and to give speech __PUNCT__ but i wa there __NUM__ year ago fight for univers health care __PUNCT__
and i still am __PUNCT__
i wa there when we help to form the children health insur program and took on the insur compani and had the drug compani have to final agre to test drug for kid __PUNCT__ instead of just have them prescrib __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i took on the bush white hous over health care for nation guard and reserv member __PUNCT__
and on so mani issu __PUNCT__ i been on the front line of make chang __PUNCT__
i think i know exactli what it will take __PUNCT__ becaus i do have thi uniqu experi __PUNCT__ have been in the white hous __PUNCT__ have serv a full term and then reelect with __NUM__ percent of the vote __PUNCT__ becaus i serv the peopl of new york __PUNCT__ who gave me the chanc to go to the senat __PUNCT__ i think give me a perspect that is essenti __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ i got to __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i wish it were that easi __PUNCT__ to show up in washington and sai __PUNCT__ let get everybodi togeth and we all just go to chang becaus the presid want us to __PUNCT__
that not the wai it ever work __PUNCT__
not the wai it will work __PUNCT__
but i have a proven record of get bipartisan legisl through the senat as a first ladi __PUNCT__ as someon who understand what it go to take __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ i got to __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ and i think that count for a lot __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ we got to get a break __PUNCT__
we not finish just yet __PUNCT__
we got some more to ask senat clinton ahead on larri king live __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ we back with senat clinton __PUNCT__
if the level of violenc in iraq __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ is the same or wors __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ of next year __PUNCT__ would you still advoc your plan of phase redeploy __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i would __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__ becaus i don't think anyon can predict the futur __PUNCT__
we don't know what the consequ of ani of our action will be in iraq __PUNCT__
on thing i confid of __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ is stai there is not the right decis for america __PUNCT__
our militari is stretch thin __PUNCT__
we have given the iraqi the preciou gift of freedom __PUNCT__
our young men and women have perform heroic __PUNCT__
the iraqi have not step up and taken respons __PUNCT__ as we had hope __PUNCT__ that thei would begin to make those decis that onli thei can make for themselv __PUNCT__
and by our stai in iraq __PUNCT__ we ar lose ground elsewher in the world __PUNCT__
our militari and foreign polici expert have all said that we have lost ground in afghanistan __PUNCT__
the middl east is in a much more danger posit than it wa __PUNCT__
we have all kind of problem __PUNCT__ from latin america to africa to asia __PUNCT__
china and russia ar reassert their posit in the world __PUNCT__
we ar not move to realli take the global leadership that america must take for our own secur and for the stabil of the rest of the world __PUNCT__
as we begin to withdraw our troop __PUNCT__ i believ that will help to focu the iraqi __PUNCT__ unlik the blank check that presid bush ha given them __PUNCT__
and that thei will have to understand that we ar not go to be there to save them __PUNCT__ protect them __PUNCT__ to step in for them __PUNCT__
and we also have to engag in veri vigor diplomat effort with the other countri in the region that have a big stake in a stabl iraq __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i am commit to do it respons __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ __URL__
but i will begin to withdraw troop within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ how ar you go to do tomorrow __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i hope i do well __PUNCT__
i never make predict __PUNCT__
i campaign hard __PUNCT__
we been all over the state __PUNCT__
i think peopl have work extrem hard for me and i hope to do well __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ it import for me __PUNCT__
but i think it also import for my oppon __PUNCT__
he should try to win thi state __PUNCT__ which he been do __PUNCT__ becaus he know he hasn't won ani big state except hi own __PUNCT__
and i think that import for democrat __PUNCT__ who won the big state __PUNCT__ who been there to put togeth the elector map that we need to win in the fall __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ if you __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ he ha yet to close the deal on those big state __PUNCT__
king __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ if you win it __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ percent or less __PUNCT__ will that be a measur stick __PUNCT__ there ar those who will sai __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ you should leav the race if you that close in pennsylvania __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ or you don't look at that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i sure don't __PUNCT__ larri __PUNCT__
a win is a win __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i think thi is such a close race __PUNCT__
and neither of us ha the deleg we need to get the nomin __PUNCT__
we got nine more contest after pennsylvania __PUNCT__ some veri import state that ar still up to bat __PUNCT__
and i think we go to go all the wai through thi process and see where we stand in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we also __PUNCT__ don't forget __PUNCT__ have to decid how we go to seat the deleg from florida and michigan __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million peopl vote __PUNCT__
i don't want to disenfranchis either of those state __PUNCT__
thei also critic to an elector victori for a democrat __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thei sai that the path to the white hous on pennsylvania avenu goe through pennsylvania __PUNCT__
and if i fortun enough to win tomorrow __PUNCT__ that will be yet anoth state that i have won in __PUNCT__ be outspent dramat by my oppon __PUNCT__ and have been abl to put togeth the coalit that is realli go to be the base of our campaign against john mccain in the fall __PUNCT__
