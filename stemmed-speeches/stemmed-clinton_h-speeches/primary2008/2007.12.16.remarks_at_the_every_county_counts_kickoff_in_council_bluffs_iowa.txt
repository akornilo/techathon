i grew up in a middl class famili outsid of chicago __PUNCT__ right here in the midwest __PUNCT__
my father came home after serv in the navi for five year and he want to do three thing __PUNCT__ he want to start a small busi __PUNCT__ he want to start a famili __PUNCT__ and he want to save enough monei to bui a hous __PUNCT__
my mother __PUNCT__ who didn't have a veri easi upbring __PUNCT__ she want to give her children she never had a chanc to do and that wa to go to colleg __PUNCT__
so we live the middl class valu __PUNCT__
we understood __PUNCT__ as my parent taught me __PUNCT__ that we had to work hard __PUNCT__ be self __PUNCT__ reliant __PUNCT__ be resili __PUNCT__ but also to be compassion and care __PUNCT__
to be part of the larger commun in order to give everi american __PUNCT__ particularli everi child __PUNCT__ a chanc to live up to hi or her god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
well my __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year old mother __PUNCT__ god bless her __PUNCT__ still live with me __PUNCT__
i brought her out on the campaign trail as some of you mai have seen from the media and she had such a great time that she decid she might do a littl more of that if she had enough rest in between stop __PUNCT__
but as we travel around __PUNCT__ it wa a great remind to me of the commit i feel to make sure that those who ar in the twilight of their year and those who ar at the veri dawn of their live __PUNCT__ all have a chanc to pursu that american dream that ha meant so much to all of us __PUNCT__
and so i run for presid becaus i know that there ar a lot of famili in america todai __PUNCT__ certainli here in iowa __PUNCT__ whom i met __PUNCT__
thei been kind enough to share their stori and concern with me __PUNCT__ and their worri thei feel anxiou and insecur __PUNCT__
thei don't know whether life will be better for their children and their grandchildren __PUNCT__
thei ask themselv everydai __PUNCT__ why is it no on seem to notic that i work as hard as i can and i not get ahead __PUNCT__ that i don't have health care for myself or my children __PUNCT__ that my job ha been outsourc and i don't know where i suppos to go to get anoth on __PUNCT__
these ar the real life concern that iowan have share with me over the past eleven month __PUNCT__
i want to tell you that there will not be ani invis american when i am presid __PUNCT__
everyon will be seen __PUNCT__ respect __PUNCT__ heard __PUNCT__
and just as i sai that everi counti count in my campaign __PUNCT__ i want you to know that you be abl to count on me when i am your presid __PUNCT__
i will get up everi singl dai think about what i could do that dai to make life a littl easier __PUNCT__ to make our countri fairer __PUNCT__ to restor share prosper and econom opportun __PUNCT__ to restor our moral author around the world and to give american back our pride in our countri that we love so veri much __PUNCT__
after seven year of georg bush __PUNCT__ america is readi for chang __PUNCT__
we ar readi for a new begin __PUNCT__
now it all come down to on question __PUNCT__
who is readi and abl to make the chang we need start on dai on in the white hous __PUNCT__ audienc __PUNCT__ you ar __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ some peopl believ you make chang by demand it __PUNCT__
some peopl believ you make chang by hope for it __PUNCT__
i believ you make chang by work hard for it __PUNCT__
that what i done all my life and that is what i will do for you __PUNCT__
i know that how you make real chang in the live of the real peopl that i know and care about __PUNCT__ that i have fought for for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
now that hard work demand that you know when to stand your ground and when to find common ground __PUNCT__
if you too unyield __PUNCT__ you won't get anyth done __PUNCT__
not in america __PUNCT__ we not a dictatorship __PUNCT__
you have to work with other peopl __PUNCT__
but if you don't stand up and refus to compromis on what import __PUNCT__ then you could lose out the opportun to make chang __PUNCT__
so you have to know how to balanc it __PUNCT__ how to stand your ground and how to find common ground __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year i have been a chang __PUNCT__ maker and that is exactli what i hope to do for all of you and for everi american __PUNCT__
now for me that mean that i start when i got out of law school __PUNCT__ not go to work for a big corpor law firm but go to work for the children defens fund __PUNCT__
and i did that becaus i watch and learn about my mother life __PUNCT__
the fact that she had to go to work as a mother helper when she wa __NUM__ and it wa hard __PUNCT__
and i believ that kid should be given a better shot than that __PUNCT__ and that a lot of kid draw the short straw in life __PUNCT__
on of the first thing i work on wa go door to door __PUNCT__ try to find out where miss children were __PUNCT__
miss not becaus somebodi had kidnap them but miss becaus thei weren't in school __PUNCT__
back in the earli __NUM__ you could look at censu figur about the number of children who live in a particular area __PUNCT__
then you could look at school enrol figur and there were children who were in the area who weren't in school and nobodi could figur out why __PUNCT__
and i found out why __PUNCT__
i found children who were blind __PUNCT__ children who were deaf __PUNCT__ children in wheelchair __PUNCT__ children with other kind of disabl __PUNCT__
there wa no place for them in a beauti school like thi __PUNCT__
so i work with mani other to chang the law __PUNCT__ to make it possibl for children with disabl to get a public educ and i wa proud to be part of make chang that help million and million of american __PUNCT__
in arkansa i work to expand rural health care into some of the poorest place in the state __PUNCT__
i work to reform school so if you were a poor child live in a realli poor area of arkansa you often would go to a school that didn't have physic __PUNCT__ it didn't have advanc mathemat __PUNCT__ or chemistri __PUNCT__ it didn't have foreign languag __PUNCT__
so no matter how talent you were __PUNCT__ no matter how hard work you were will to be __PUNCT__ you would never be abl to compet for a first class educ __PUNCT__
so we chang that __PUNCT__
we chang the standard __PUNCT__
we improv educ and independ observ said it wa on of the best reform in the countri __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ you see __PUNCT__ i knew that to make chang you had to work with peopl __PUNCT__ to rais teacher salari and to expand the curriculum __PUNCT__ so thousand of arkansa student now have an educ that wa deni to previou gener and i am proud that i wa part of make those chang as well __PUNCT__
and as i continu to work __PUNCT__ i chair the legal servic corpor to make sure that equal justic under law wasn't some cruel hoax in america __PUNCT__
that if you were poor and you had a legitim legal problem __PUNCT__ you would have somebodi who would give you your dai in court __PUNCT__
and i wa veri pleas that i could __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ work with a lot of veri knowledg peopl to try to bring univers health care to our countri __PUNCT__
now we were not success but i am veri proud we tri becaus it wa the right thing to do and now we ar go to get it done when i becom presid again __PUNCT__
i travel to beij as first ladi on behalf of all of you __PUNCT__ to stand up for a veri simpl proposit __PUNCT__ that women right ar human right and human right ar women right __PUNCT__
it not onli what we believ __PUNCT__ here in our countri __PUNCT__ it what we know is import for our nation secur __PUNCT__
countri that deni women their right ar often countri that we have problem with __PUNCT__ aren't thei __PUNCT__ so we got to continu to stand up for american valu and make sure those valu ar heard around the world __PUNCT__ and when i am presid i will continu to make the chang on behalf of women that ar good and right for women and smart for american secur __PUNCT__
i wrote a book call __PUNCT__ it take a villag __PUNCT__ becaus that what i believ __PUNCT__ about how we can build a better countri for our children __PUNCT__
i wa pleas to turn all of the proce from that book __PUNCT__ over a million dollar __PUNCT__ to children chariti __PUNCT__
becaus it not onli what we do in our govern that count __PUNCT__ it what we do in our daili live __PUNCT__
how we support charit enterpris that ar there with a help hand for peopl that need it __PUNCT__
and i want __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ to inspir more philanthropi __PUNCT__ to get more american involv in help their neighbor __PUNCT__
there more than enough work to do __PUNCT__ and we want to har what is realli the geniu of our countri __PUNCT__ the willing of our citizen to give of themselv __PUNCT__
when we weren't success with health care for everyon __PUNCT__ i did not give up __PUNCT__
i sometim think you can tell more about a person when you see what thei do after thei don't succe than if thei have alreadi succeed __PUNCT__
becaus we want peopl who pull themselv up __PUNCT__ don't we __PUNCT__ who get up after be knock down and keep go __PUNCT__
and that is what i did when i help to creat the children health insur program and we have seen that program over the last __NUM__ year expand health care to million of kid and now georg bush ha veto our effort to expand it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i tell you __PUNCT__ when i becom presid __PUNCT__ we go to expand health care for everi singl american child __PUNCT__
in the senat __PUNCT__ i have work across the aisl to make chang __PUNCT__
when i wa elect __PUNCT__ the peopl of new york took a chanc on me and it wa a great honor that thei did __PUNCT__
but i knew that i had to go and get thing done __PUNCT__
i couldn't just sai __PUNCT__ we i been elect __PUNCT__ thank you veri much __PUNCT__

work to make sure we had a nation emerg system so that when you hit __NUM__ on your cell phone __PUNCT__ somebodi would know where you were __PUNCT__
work to make sure that despit the differ we have in philosophi or ideolog __PUNCT__ that we cannot let partisanship stand in the wai of improv the live of the peopl in our countri __PUNCT__
