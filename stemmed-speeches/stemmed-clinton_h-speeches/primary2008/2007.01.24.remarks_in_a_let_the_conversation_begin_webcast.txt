hillari clinton __PUNCT__ hello and welcom back __PUNCT__
we have a lot to talk about tonight becaus last night wa the presid state of the union address __PUNCT__ and i know we have been get a lot of question about that __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we gotten ten of thousand of question in the last few night __PUNCT__
and i have realli been impress by how seriou peopl ar about the futur of our countri __PUNCT__
so let have that convers again tonight and let get start __PUNCT__
onc again __PUNCT__ crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our campaign blogger __PUNCT__ is here with me __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ crystal __PUNCT__ what tonight first question __PUNCT__ crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our first question tonight is from patricia in york __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__
she ask __PUNCT__ there wa no mention of the katrina disast in the state of the union __PUNCT__
did that strike you as odd __PUNCT__ isn't that a larg part of the union __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ patricia __PUNCT__ that did strike me as odd __PUNCT__
i know from talk from my friend and colleagu from the gulf coast __PUNCT__ particularli new orlean __PUNCT__ that the promis the presid made ar just not be kept __PUNCT__
thei ar more empti promis __PUNCT__
it is so heart __PUNCT__ break becaus thi is a part of our union __PUNCT__
these ar our fellow citizen and we need a much more seriou effort __PUNCT__
so i hope that with the democrat congress __PUNCT__ we will be abl to push thing along __PUNCT__ that we be abl to try to sort out some of the continu bureaucrat snafu that have present peopl from get what thei need and make decis about their futur __PUNCT__
there ar thousand of peopl who ar still displac from their home in southern louisiana and even along the mississippi coast __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let figur out what we go to do to try to help those peopl __PUNCT__
thi wa on of the worst blot on presid bush record __PUNCT__
it wa disgrac the wai thei were so inattent and differ __PUNCT__
it ha been equal disgrac how incompet and realli inadequ their respons ha been __PUNCT__
so i go to continu to talk about katrina __PUNCT__
i go to continu to work with my colleagu from the region as well as other of us that ar concern about thi to see if we can't make some progress now that we have a democrat major __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question come from alexand in palm spring __PUNCT__ california __PUNCT__
after hear the state of the union address last night __PUNCT__ do you agre or disagre with presid bush plan for medic insur for the peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__ if you disagre __PUNCT__ what would you do differ __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ alexand __PUNCT__ we didn't get a lot of detail last night __PUNCT__
it wa a coupl of line in a nearli hour __PUNCT__ long speech __PUNCT__
so i try to make sure that i understand exactli what the presid is propos __PUNCT__
and what i worri about is that the presid plan want to cap the deduct that you get for the cost of health care and essenti us that to try to help uninsur peopl get some tax benefit to go out into the marketplac and bui health insur __PUNCT__
there is no real market yet __PUNCT__
thi would requir that we would have to tell insur compani thei would have to insur peopl __PUNCT__ even with preexist condit __PUNCT__ which thei don't want to do __PUNCT__ that thei would have to keep their cost down in order for a lot of the peopl who ar insur and peopl who ar just abov that line to be abl to afford it __PUNCT__
so i go to be focus on a more comprehens approach becaus the other problem that i have with the presid plan is the wai he would help to pai for thi is by cut feder fund for public hospit and commun health center __PUNCT__
that is realli a fals choic in my book __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be cut the monei that goe to actual give peopl health care to get them into the insur market __PUNCT__
i will be propos in the next week or so my own plan about how we get to univers coverag __PUNCT__
i pleas __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ let me add that the presid wa will to talk about health care and come forward with a propos __PUNCT__
i have told member of hi administr that a good sign and we need to figur out how we can work togeth to try to make progress __PUNCT__
but at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ we go to have a much more comprehens approach if we ar go to tackl the problem of coverag so that everybodi is insur __PUNCT__ qualiti so what you ar insur for is good qualiti care __PUNCT__ cost becaus __PUNCT__ it wai too expens in america compar to the rest of the world and we don't even have the highest qualiti health care compar to the rest of the world __PUNCT__
and competit __PUNCT__ we ar lose job becaus of the health care cost that ar impos on our busi __PUNCT__
so i have got a lot of idea __PUNCT__
stai tune __PUNCT__
we talk about that later __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ we ar go to take a break from the live question to respond to steve clemon who post the follow on the huffington post blog __PUNCT__
would you be the kind of presid who gave your staff licens to challeng you __PUNCT__ to forc consider of everi last polici action __PUNCT__ to put bad new befor good new __PUNCT__ or do you like your team to valid your view and not challeng you __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ steve __PUNCT__ i think you can ask anybodi who work for me that i like peopl who challeng me __PUNCT__
i like peopl with expertis and experi and strong opinion __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i mai push back becaus i also have my opinion __PUNCT__ but i want that kind of give and take and debat __PUNCT__
i don't think ani on person __PUNCT__ and certainli no presid in these difficult and complex time __PUNCT__ have all the answer __PUNCT__
and i don't think you find answer from an ideolog start point __PUNCT__
i believ in look at the fact and the evid __PUNCT__ try to understand what you try to achiev in term of the valu that you have and the object that you set forth in order to get result __PUNCT__
what we seen in the last six year is exactli the opposit __PUNCT__
it is as though there is a littl echo chamber where everybodi is sai the same thing where the presid __PUNCT__ from what we been told __PUNCT__ is rare challeng or confront __PUNCT__
that is not the kind of offic that i run todai __PUNCT__
that is certainli not the kind of white hous that i would want __PUNCT__
anoth thing __PUNCT__ i would like to get a broad cross __PUNCT__ section of peopl __PUNCT__
i don't want peopl who alreadi agre with me __PUNCT__
i want honest __PUNCT__ experienc __PUNCT__ hard __PUNCT__ work patriot peopl who want to be part of a team __PUNCT__ the american team __PUNCT__ in order to understand what we have to do to meet the challeng of todai __PUNCT__
so i hope that if you ever run across anybodi who work for me __PUNCT__ you will probabl hear that i have got high standard becaus there is a lot at stake __PUNCT__
i want peopl to work to the best of their abil and i want them to be part of a team __PUNCT__ even if the other member of the team disagre __PUNCT__
i think through that process you can come to better conclus __PUNCT__
and i alwai open to new evid __PUNCT__ new wai of look at thing __PUNCT__ ask those hard question about the direct we head __PUNCT__
i think it lead to better decis __PUNCT__ make __PUNCT__
and sometim it is a littl messi becaus you try to get to a point after hear all side and you want to keep search for the veri best outcom __PUNCT__ the consensu that go to stand the test __PUNCT__
but that __PUNCT__ to me __PUNCT__ is a better wai of make decis than thi kind of top __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ intimidatori style where you have to tell them what thei want to hear __PUNCT__
that been a disast and i certainli hope we can get beyond that __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from alic in corneliu __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
what ar your plan and propos for domest homeland secur __PUNCT__ would you approv a budget that would aid in secur servic such as the fbi and cia to carri out specif duti in fight terror __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ alic __PUNCT__ thi ha been a princip concern ever sinc 9/11 __PUNCT__
as a senat repres new york on that horribl __PUNCT__ horribl dai __PUNCT__ i saw firsthand and i still deal with the consequ todai of our lack of prepared __PUNCT__ our failur to commun adequ of the stress we were face __PUNCT__
i have veri strong feel about thi __PUNCT__
i introduc some of the veri first legisl after 9/11 that would try to get monei to our law enforc agenc __PUNCT__ to our intellig agenc __PUNCT__
but equal import __PUNCT__ get it to our local commun __PUNCT__
thei ar the first line of defens with our local fire depart and our polic depart and our paramed and our health depart and so mani other that ar work dilig to try to be prepar in the case of a natur disast like katrina which we were just discuss or a terrorist attack __PUNCT__
so from my perspect __PUNCT__ we need to do mani thing simultan __PUNCT__
we need to beef up our homeland secur fund so we protect our border __PUNCT__
we protect our port __PUNCT__ our mass transit system __PUNCT__
we have done better with airlin passeng sinc 9/11 __PUNCT__
airlin cargo __PUNCT__ we still have work to do __PUNCT__
our vital infrastructur like bridg and tunnel __PUNCT__ some of our landmark build __PUNCT__
we have got to have the veri best secur __PUNCT__
it not just for the public sector __PUNCT__
the privat sector ha to be involv __PUNCT__
thei own a lot of our build __PUNCT__
thei ar landlord for build __PUNCT__
thei run our big mall and our sport stadium __PUNCT__
thi ha to be a partnership __PUNCT__
recent we got the administr to set standard for the chemic industri __PUNCT__
we have so mani chemic plant in our countri that could be disast if thei were ever attack and there were explos __PUNCT__
that could affect liter million of peopl in certain highli congest area __PUNCT__
we have to do a better job of share inform among level of govern __PUNCT__
the feder __PUNCT__ state and local govern __PUNCT__
we have to get all of our feder agenc work togeth __PUNCT__ the homeland secur __PUNCT__ fbi __PUNCT__ the cia __PUNCT__ counterterror center __PUNCT__
all of that ha to be much more streamlin and focus so that the polic on the beat in the car who stop somebodi that mai be suspici __PUNCT__ mai be somebodi that the fbi is look for __PUNCT__ thei will have that inform __PUNCT__ thei will be abl to immedi respond __PUNCT__
so we have a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
we have made progress sinc 9/11 __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the 9/11 commiss which did such a great job in analyz what happen on 9/11 came out with a report card last year and basic gave our feder govern a d __PUNCT__ that not a veri good grade __PUNCT__
it mai not be a fail grade __PUNCT__ but i sure wouldn't want to bring it home to my mother __PUNCT__
we have to do a better job in try to work togeth __PUNCT__ get the monei to follow the threat which is what the 9/11 commiss recommend __PUNCT__ and then make sure that all level of govern and the public and the privat sector ar work togeth __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from judi in seymour __PUNCT__ connecticut __PUNCT__
i am a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old widow of __NUM__ year struggl to get by on social secur __PUNCT__
i know there ar mani widow in my situat __PUNCT__

so i am veri concern about thi becaus as you know so well there ar so mani older women who ar live alon and it is great that thei healthi enough __PUNCT__ independ enough __PUNCT__
but as you get older __PUNCT__ you have __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ some challeng __PUNCT__
and certainli my highest prioriti is to protect social secur __PUNCT__
i consid it a solemn gener promis __PUNCT__
and i wa adamantli oppos to the presid plan to privat social secur becaus the veri peopl it would have hurt the most ar older women __PUNCT__
i worri ani move to undermin the guarante of social secur would throw a lot of women who ar onli abov the poverti level todai becaus of social secur __PUNCT__ i go to continu to do everyth i can to strengthen social secur __PUNCT__
there ar some fix we will probabl have to make in order for the whole system to keep oper and i go to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ be open to do that __PUNCT__
but i will never support privat thi basic guarante of financi secur in our older year __PUNCT__
i will also work to find differ wai of ad to the save that widow and singl women have in their later year becaus social secur is not enough and even social secur with a small pension is sometim difficult to get by on __PUNCT__
so i will certainli be attent and sensit to these concern __PUNCT__

we heard a lot about our current serv young men and women who we ar so proud of and so grate to __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ eventu __PUNCT__ thei will becom veteran __PUNCT__ and when thei return home __PUNCT__ thei should be guarante access to the highest qualiti health care through the va __PUNCT__
and unfortun __PUNCT__ we had to fight with the bush administr everi year to fund the va __PUNCT__
i believ that we should have guarante fund for the va __PUNCT__
we shouldn't have to fight it out everi singl year in the appropri process that goe on in congress to decid how we ar go to spend the monei in the budget __PUNCT__
and the va ha made a lot of improv over the last ten or so year __PUNCT__
i veri proud of the chang that were made in the clinton administr __PUNCT__ move toward inform technolog so we don't duplic and lose the medic record and the test result __PUNCT__
i am veri proud of the power that wa given to the va when bill wa presid to allow the va to negoti for lower prescript drug price __PUNCT__
as your question impli __PUNCT__ there ar still long __PUNCT__ long line __PUNCT__ wait period __PUNCT__
we just haven't put togeth the servic that ar need to take care of our return vet __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ as you probabl know __PUNCT__ we go to have so mani young men and women with seriou condit go forward __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the battlefield is a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ degre __PUNCT__ 24/7 situat now __PUNCT__
and mani peopl ar abl to surviv wound that would have kill them in the first gulf war and certainli vietnam or world war ii __PUNCT__
what that mean is that we have a lot of serious injur young peopl with amput limb __PUNCT__ with traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__ with spinal cord injuri __PUNCT__
and we ow them everyth __PUNCT__
i will be a veri strong advoc for our veteran and not just in show up at veteran __PUNCT__ gather and make a patriot speech but in fight for veteran __PUNCT__ in fight for their health care __PUNCT__ in fight for the va __PUNCT__ in fight for fair treatment for vet __PUNCT__
we have an all __PUNCT__ volunt militari now __PUNCT__
so to a great extent our militari is compos of young men and women to realli want to make a commit to our countri __PUNCT__
we so proud of them and grate to them __PUNCT__
but let show it by take care of them __PUNCT__
let not just give lip servic to their need __PUNCT__
let make sure that the va is fulli fund to meet the ongo physic and mental health need of our veteran __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from jami in illinoi __PUNCT__
hiv/aid in the usa __PUNCT__ what will you do and make sure american ar care for __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ thi is an issu for me for a long time __PUNCT__
especi as a senat from new york __PUNCT__ we have a veri high popul of peopl live with hiv and aid __PUNCT__
i believ we need to provid the full rang of medic care and support servic for peopl who ar afflict with hiv and aid __PUNCT__
i have been a strong support of the feder program that fund treatment for peopl live with hiv and aid __PUNCT__
and i will continu to do so __PUNCT__
here in our countri __PUNCT__ the fastest __PUNCT__ grow group of peopl that ar be infect with the diseas ar women of color __PUNCT__ ar women who ar poor __PUNCT__
thei ar often be left out of the servic system and the program that ar avail to treat peopl with hiv and aid __PUNCT__
i want to be sure that everybodi ha access to the medic care that thei need __PUNCT__
we ar go to have to do some work __PUNCT__ excus me __PUNCT__ to get that done __PUNCT__
i think it is veri import that we recogn that the popul is grow in our southern state __PUNCT__
and up until now __PUNCT__ there hasn't been enough treatment avail for peopl in those state __PUNCT__
i had a big fight __PUNCT__ you mai know if you follow thi issu thi past year becaus the ryan white care act is on of the princip vehicl for provid health care to peopl live with hiv/aid __PUNCT__
what i realli argu against wa instead of keep the monei at the same level __PUNCT__ the feder govern should increas the amount of monei avail __PUNCT__
and thei want to take monei awai from my state of new york which still ha the highest number of peopl in order to take care of the peopl who ar suffer in other state __PUNCT__
i want to take care of everybodi __PUNCT__
but why take it awai from peopl who need it to give it to other peopl who need it __PUNCT__ it is on of the reason why we need a new presid and why i am look forward to be that presid __PUNCT__ to make sure that we take care of everybodi who is afflict with thi diseas __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ brian from new york sai __PUNCT__ how will you handl the current nuclear crisi in iran and north korea __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ let me get a glass of water here becaus i am lose my voic __PUNCT__
i have think i have done too much talk in the sever dai __PUNCT__
we ar in a terribl situat becaus of the wai thi administr ha mishandl both north korea and iran __PUNCT__
with respect to north korea __PUNCT__ we had a crisi with north korea in __NUM__ and we were abl to prevent them from process plutonium __PUNCT__
that the fastest __PUNCT__ easiest wai to get what you need for a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the north korean be the north korean were cheat and thei were try to enrich uranium __PUNCT__
thei didn't breach the agreement about plutonium but thei were cheat on the side try to enrich uranium which is frankli harder to do __PUNCT__
when the bush administr found out thei were cheat __PUNCT__ thei said we ar not go to talk to you anymor __PUNCT__
we ar take the inspector out __PUNCT__
we ar shun you becaus you were cheat __PUNCT__
that wa __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ an open invit to the north korean to process plutonium __PUNCT__
as we have seen __PUNCT__ thei have produc some nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
i think that wa a backward approach __PUNCT__
we should have come down even harder on the north korean __PUNCT__
we should have put even more inspector in and we should have been veri tough in negoti with them directli __PUNCT__
we made the same mistak with iran __PUNCT__
instead of negoti and deal with iran and figur out what thei were up to and try to understand who wa realli call the shot __PUNCT__ thi administr attitud is __PUNCT__ we don't talk to bad peopl __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i don't know why that a veri sensibl polici in their view __PUNCT__ but that their polici __PUNCT__
thei stop talk to iran __PUNCT__
instead thei told the british __PUNCT__ german and the french __PUNCT__ you go talk to iran __PUNCT__
so that went on for year with no real result and iran is just continu to push forward __PUNCT__
i have advoc direct contact __PUNCT__ engag with both of these regim __PUNCT__
do i agre with what thei do __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ not __PUNCT__
do i trust them __PUNCT__ absolut not __PUNCT__
we dealt with the soviet union all dure the cold war when thei had thousand missil point at us __PUNCT__
we didn't stop talk to them even dure the cuban missil crisi __PUNCT__
we gain valuabl inform that enabl us to take step that led to the demis of the soviet union __PUNCT__
i would urg that we do the same thing with iran and north korea __PUNCT__
i would like to see the administr begin do that sooner instead of later __PUNCT__

i live in a small town in south dakota so my wife and i can stai close to our root __PUNCT__
we ar recent colleg graduat and work hard in colleg and continu to do so as graduat __PUNCT__
we ar find the contrast our societi live in now __PUNCT__ that is __PUNCT__ get an educ equal success __PUNCT__
what it should sai is get an educ equal debt with high interest rate and the inabl to bui a home __PUNCT__ start a famili and live a good life __PUNCT__
with the rise cost of health care __PUNCT__ interest rate on student loan __PUNCT__ rise hous market and not be compens for our educ __PUNCT__ what would you sai to the youth of america to stai focus and go to school __PUNCT__ hillari clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think that is the messag __PUNCT__ that i understand complet the problem that you have just outlin __PUNCT__

i want to get the interest rate on loan down __PUNCT__
i want to give more forgiv for debt for peopl who go into area of shortag or need in our societi __PUNCT__ like math and scienc teacher or engin __PUNCT__
we have a lot of work that need to be done in america and we aren't go to be success if we make it so difficult for our young peopl to afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ stai in colleg and complet colleg __PUNCT__
