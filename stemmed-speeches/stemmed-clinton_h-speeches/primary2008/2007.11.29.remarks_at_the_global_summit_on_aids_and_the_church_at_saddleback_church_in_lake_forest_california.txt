and i want to thank their tremend staff and the volunt and everyon who help make thi happen __PUNCT__
i grate for the opportun to share our commit about deal with the global scourg of hiv/aid __PUNCT__
i also want to recogn two first ladi __PUNCT__ the first ladi of zambia and the first ladi of rwanda __PUNCT__
i am delight that thei ar here repres their countri and their peopl __PUNCT__
and first __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ let me first sai how reliev bill and i were to hear that saddleback wa spare from the recent wildfir __PUNCT__ and how impress and move we were to hear about the love and support that you gave those who were not so fortun __PUNCT__
it anoth exampl of the wai in which thi church is not measur by number __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the number ar big __PUNCT__ thei certainli impress __PUNCT__
but it measur by your impact __PUNCT__
it measur by the mean that you give to live here within thi complex and so far beyond it boundari __PUNCT__
and the commit that you demonstr both to our faith in god and to do hi work here on earth is exemplari and that is on of the mani reason that i want to be here todai __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ rick ha help so mani peopl with hi lesson for a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ dai spiritu journei __PUNCT__
but he know those __NUM__ dai ar just the begin __PUNCT__
my own faith journei is approach a half a centuri __PUNCT__ and i know how far i still have to go __PUNCT__
but i have been bless in my life __PUNCT__ both start in my famili and in the church of my childhood __PUNCT__ to be guid everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
a mother __PUNCT__ who taught sundai school and made sure that my brother and i were there the minut the church door open __PUNCT__
a father __PUNCT__ who kneel by the side of hi bed everi night of hi life to sai hi prayer __PUNCT__
a minist of our youth fellowship __PUNCT__ who took it as part of hi mission to show the group of white __PUNCT__ suburban __PUNCT__ middl class kid that there wa a bigger world outsid __PUNCT__
and a prayer group that form for me shortli after i came to the white hous __PUNCT__ a group of extraordinari women __PUNCT__ both democrat and republican __PUNCT__ whose love and support sustain me __PUNCT__
i often been ask if i a prai person and i have alwai respond that i wa fortun enough to be rais to understand that the power and purpos of prayer __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ had i not been __PUNCT__ probabl on week in the white hous would have turn me into on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it wonder to know that the sustain power of prayer is there for so mani of us __PUNCT__
on of my favorit passag in scriptur is that famou line in jame that faith without work is dead __PUNCT__
but i have conclud that work without faith is just too hard __PUNCT__
it cannot be sustain over on life or over the gener __PUNCT__
and it import for us to recogn how here __PUNCT__ in what you do __PUNCT__ faith and work come togeth __PUNCT__
you understand that __PUNCT__
or as rick might sai __PUNCT__ creed and deed __PUNCT__ and what extraordinari import work your faith support __PUNCT__ fight against spiritu empti __PUNCT__ corrupt leadership __PUNCT__ poverti __PUNCT__ illiteraci __PUNCT__ and diseas like aid around the world __PUNCT__
twenti __PUNCT__ five year ago __PUNCT__ when men __PUNCT__ mostli young gai men __PUNCT__ began dy from a diseas that had no name __PUNCT__ we could not have __PUNCT__ and certainli did not __PUNCT__ talk about it in church __PUNCT__
it would not have been proper __PUNCT__
it would not have been polit __PUNCT__
it would have been discomfort for so mani of us __PUNCT__
but the diseas itself wa not polit __PUNCT__ and ignor it did not make it go awai __PUNCT__
it onli made the problem wors __PUNCT__ becaus the diseas fed on ignor and fear and __PUNCT__ let be honest __PUNCT__ on prejudic __PUNCT__
we ar taught to heal the sick __PUNCT__
to love them as our own __PUNCT__
but twenti __PUNCT__ five year ago __PUNCT__ too mani di alon __PUNCT__ asham to tell their famili what had made them ill __PUNCT__
in the gospel __PUNCT__ we learn that on __PUNCT__ third of christ ministri wa heal the sick __PUNCT__
and if you read those moment __PUNCT__ when jesu is present with someon who is ill __PUNCT__ it becom abundantli clear that christ had a choic __PUNCT__
he could have been too busi __PUNCT__
he could have thought you know thi is not the messag of the dai __PUNCT__
i don't need to do thi __PUNCT__ i alreadi done it in capernaum so i don't need to do it again __PUNCT__
but he made the choic __PUNCT__
he never ask why someon wa sick __PUNCT__
he just heal and minist those in need __PUNCT__
that is what saddleback ha chosen too __PUNCT__
other church __PUNCT__ nonprofit __PUNCT__ and govern have also chosen to heal __PUNCT__ to help __PUNCT__ to redeem __PUNCT__
for mani of us the golden rule call on us to act __PUNCT__
and so we come a long wai __PUNCT__
not onli can we talk about aid in church __PUNCT__ but church ar lead the wai __PUNCT__
thank to leader like rick and kai __PUNCT__ christian have embrac the sickest among us __PUNCT__ and have fought the diseas itself __PUNCT__
we had breakthrough in treatment that allow those with thi diseas to live much longer __PUNCT__ and we ar hope for breakthrough in vaccin and other cure __PUNCT__
but let us not grow complac or too comfort __PUNCT__
let us not feel that becaus we here at thi confer or as a member of saddleback or some other church repres todai that we ar do our part __PUNCT__ becaus we have such a long wai to go __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we still have an aid epidem __PUNCT__
hiv infect rate ar rise among gai men again and among african american and latino __PUNCT__
the diseas take a disproportion toll on the poor and commun of color __PUNCT__
and it is an outrag that hiv/aid is the lead caus of death for black women between the ag of __NUM__ and __NUM__ in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
around the world __PUNCT__ aid remain a plagu of biblic proport __PUNCT__
in too mani place __PUNCT__ ignor about aid prevail and the stigma remain strong __PUNCT__
and where ignor and prejudic live __PUNCT__ the diseas thrive __PUNCT__
when i walk through the world vision villag __PUNCT__ i wa told the stori of kambo __PUNCT__ a young kenyan boi who lost first hi father and hi mother to what is call the __PUNCT__ big diseas __PUNCT__
and for year hi grandmoth had told him he did not have it __PUNCT__
but after the death of hi mother __PUNCT__ he began to sicken __PUNCT__ final wa test and found out he wa posit __PUNCT__
even befor the posit result came in __PUNCT__ the boi he plai soccer with began to shun him __PUNCT__
it becam increasingli uncomfort to go to school __PUNCT__
so the stigma is on of the real evil that ha to be combat if we ar to take on hiv/aid around the world __PUNCT__
we should take heart that the unit nation recent revis it estim of the number of peopl infect with hiv downward from __NUM__ million to __NUM__ million __PUNCT__
but pleas don't take ani comfort __PUNCT__
there ar still __NUM__ peopl infect and __NUM__ who die from aid everi dai __PUNCT__
aid is still the number on caus of death in africa __PUNCT__ where __NUM__ percent of the hiv posit children in the world live __PUNCT__
don't let anyon tell you that the time for alarm ha pass __PUNCT__
we can't slow __PUNCT__
we can't rest __PUNCT__
and we can't quit __PUNCT__
i seen the tragedi of aid firsthand __PUNCT__
from a dear friend __PUNCT__ who told me in the earli 1980 __PUNCT__ much i must confess to my surpris in those dai __PUNCT__ that he wa gai __PUNCT__
he had the unnam diseas __PUNCT__ and he di shortli after __PUNCT__
to the twelv year __PUNCT__ old girl that i met in northern thailand at a shelter for former prostitut __PUNCT__
she had been sold into prostitut at the ag of eight by her famili for a satellit televis __PUNCT__
she wa put to work in bangkok brothel __PUNCT__
she contract aid and wa turn out and return home to a famili that would not take her in __PUNCT__
she did find refug in the shelter __PUNCT__
when i met her she wa in a wheelchair __PUNCT__ so weak she didn't have the strength to talk __PUNCT__
as i knelt down besid her __PUNCT__ i could see the skin stretch tightli across her cheekbon __PUNCT__
i thought of my own daughter and of all the girl her ag who speak with such excit about their futur __PUNCT__ and about how cruel an injustic it wa that thi child would never know her __PUNCT__
a week after i return to america __PUNCT__ peopl run the shelter contact me to tell me she had di __PUNCT__
to thi dai __PUNCT__ i think of that gentl face and those warm ey and what might have been done to spare her the fate she met __PUNCT__
she mai have di on the other side of the world __PUNCT__ but aid is not just an african problem __PUNCT__ it not just an asian problem __PUNCT__ and it not just an american problem __PUNCT__
and it certainli not someon els problem __PUNCT__
it a problem of our common human __PUNCT__ and we ar call to respond __PUNCT__ with love __PUNCT__ with merci __PUNCT__ and with urgenc __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will wage the fight against aid with the passion commit it demand __PUNCT__
i will ask for __MONEY__ billion over five year to combat hiv/aid __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and i will ask for more monei to tackl tuberculosi and malaria around the world as well __PUNCT__
i will build on the fund level in pepfar and on the leadership that the presid and mr __PUNCT__ bush have shown __PUNCT__ to demonstr that the fight against hiv/aid __PUNCT__ tb __PUNCT__ and malaria is an american commit that exemplifi what we can do if we seek bipartisan solut to nonpartisan problem __PUNCT__
if we start act not as republican and democrat but as american again __PUNCT__
thi is also a great opportun for partnership __PUNCT__
there ar mani church and faith base group here in our countri and increasingli in other part of the world who ar understand the urgenc of thi mission __PUNCT__
there ar mani foundat and not for profit organ like the gate foundat or my husband work for the clinton foundat __PUNCT__
thei ar supplement what we ar do through the govern __PUNCT__ and thei ar do what the govern cannot do __PUNCT__
and it is that partnership that is uniqu american __PUNCT__
when i wa privileg to repres our countri around the world __PUNCT__ travel to more than __NUM__ countri __PUNCT__ i wa often struck by how so much of the rest of the world did not understand the voluntari sector in america __PUNCT__
as rick wa sai __PUNCT__ the privat __PUNCT__ the public __PUNCT__ the parish __PUNCT__ there wa no sens that individu would volunt their time __PUNCT__ give up their monei to help meet a common need __PUNCT__
but we ar set forth that exampl __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ in the work that is now occur __PUNCT__
by do thi __PUNCT__ which is the right thing to do __PUNCT__ we ar also help to improv america stand in the world __PUNCT__
we ar put a differ face on our countri __PUNCT__ we ar reach out in a common search for answer __PUNCT__
and we will be abl not onli to build on that work __PUNCT__ to save live __PUNCT__ to prevent the spread of thi diseas __PUNCT__ but also to creat a broader platform for the valu and ideal that we hold dear __PUNCT__
in order to accomplish my goal as presid i have laid out a veri comprehens hiv/aid agenda __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ my administr will invest in treatment and capac build by improv health system across africa and doubl the number of peopl receiv anti __PUNCT__ retrovir treatment with u. __PUNCT__ fund in five year __PUNCT__
everyon who is hiv posit must have access to these drug __PUNCT__
i want particularli to target mother __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ child transmiss __PUNCT__
we know how to stop the spread of the viru from mother to child but we don't have the resourc and the system behind deliv the drug that ar necessari __PUNCT__
i believ we should do much more to encourag voluntari test __PUNCT__ but in order to do that it must be accompani by counsel and there ha to be a public educ and outreach effort to undermin and diminish the stigma __PUNCT__
some countri ar begin to do thi and we should encourag them __PUNCT__
secondli __PUNCT__ i invest heavili in prevent __PUNCT__ teach young men and women how to be respons __PUNCT__ how best to protect themselv __PUNCT__
i visit uganda ten year ago to highlight their a __PUNCT__ b __PUNCT__ c program __PUNCT__ and it produc result __PUNCT__
abstin __PUNCT__ be faith __PUNCT__ us condom if necessari __PUNCT__
and thi ha to be a messag that we do much more to commun effect throughout area that ar particularli vulner __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i continu to invest in research to develop an effect vaccin and eventu a cure __PUNCT__
there will be setback __PUNCT__ as we have recent seen __PUNCT__ but that doesn't mean we can afford to quit __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i restart the battl against aid here in america __PUNCT__
but i know that neither monei nor govern alon will solv thi problem __PUNCT__
corinthian tell us that the bodi is made up of mani part __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ though all it part ar mani __PUNCT__ thei form on bodi __PUNCT__
well we need __PUNCT__ as though we were on bodi __PUNCT__ to us everi resourc at our hand __PUNCT__ our dispos __PUNCT__
becaus as kai and rick have advoc __PUNCT__ the fight against aid must be done hand __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hand __PUNCT__ build relationship with church around the world and here at home __PUNCT__
becaus if we fail to engag church in combat aid __PUNCT__ we will fail to conquer aid __PUNCT__
as you have shown __PUNCT__ there ar six thing church can do __PUNCT__ care for those who ar infect and their famili __PUNCT__
encourag test __PUNCT__ even becom test center __PUNCT__
unleash volunt __PUNCT__
reduc the stigma by show it not a sin to be sick __PUNCT__
champion healthi behavior __PUNCT__
and be treatment coach for those take medic __PUNCT__
i would add that church also must tend to the spiritu side of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus aid is not just a medic emerg __PUNCT__
who will comfort the orphan dy alon after lose both parent to aid __PUNCT__ who will heal the empti that lead thousand of girl to be traffick for a satellit televis or a few dollar into prostitut and modern __PUNCT__ dai slaveri each year __PUNCT__ who will provid stabil and hope in commun devast by aid __PUNCT__ who will welcom the drug addict us dirti needl or the gai teenag seek safeti and guidanc __PUNCT__ just as in my own life i need both faith and work to be whole __PUNCT__ heal the world will take both faith and work as well __PUNCT__
we ar compel to address aid becaus it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
but we can also acknowledg it smart __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
aid is turn back the clock on the develop that we have seen in africa and elsewher __PUNCT__
it is destabil countri and undermin economi __PUNCT__
in some place __PUNCT__ aid can be even more destruct than war __PUNCT__
it is water the weed of volatil and despair __PUNCT__ and we should be plant seed of hope and progress __PUNCT__
and noth will help america more to win heart and mind around the world more than show america true heart on problem like aid __PUNCT__ tuberculosi __PUNCT__ and malaria __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we know our valu ar the sourc of our greatest strength __PUNCT__
as the peac plan ha recogn so clearli __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ we can't address aid in isol __PUNCT__
aid is deepli intertwin with so mani other crise __PUNCT__ and if we ar seriou about beat thi diseas __PUNCT__ we have to address them as well __PUNCT__
to end aid __PUNCT__ we need to end malaria in africa __PUNCT__
malaria is overwhelm the health infrastructur in the develop world __PUNCT__ account for __NUM__ percent of health spend in mani countri __PUNCT__ monei we need to fight aid __PUNCT__
malaria is a challeng to our conscienc in it own right __PUNCT__
it is appal that more than a million peopl die everi year from a bug bite __PUNCT__
and nearli all of them ar children __PUNCT__
a child in africa di from malaria everi __NUM__ second __PUNCT__
we made a decis to erad malaria in north america and in europ __PUNCT__
and we can do the same in africa and asia __PUNCT__
so i set a goal of end all death from malaria in africa by the end of my second term __PUNCT__
we can do thi if we ar commit togeth __PUNCT__
we also need to aggress confront tuberculosi __PUNCT__ a diseas that take the live of so mani aid victim befor thei should go __PUNCT__
a diseas that is mutat to becom drug __PUNCT__ resist __PUNCT__
that endang all of us __PUNCT__
it mai start in africa or in a prison in russia or in some other far awai place __PUNCT__ but it endang all of us becaus in a world without boundari __PUNCT__ peopl and virus move freeli __PUNCT__
to end aid __PUNCT__ we also need to educ all the world children __PUNCT__
educ not onli reduc poverti and improv health __PUNCT__ it a kei form of prevent __PUNCT__
it is what you might call a __PUNCT__ social vaccin __PUNCT__ against the spread of hiv/aid __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million young children __PUNCT__ most of them girl __PUNCT__ will not set foot in a school __PUNCT__ and hundr of million will not go beyond primari school __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ there ar more young children out of school in africa __PUNCT__ than there ar children in school in america __PUNCT__
everi dai we don't act __PUNCT__ we deni more children the childhood thei deserv __PUNCT__
we deni futur mother the abil to read a stori to their children or a warn on a medicin label __PUNCT__
we deni what is at the heart of human digniti __PUNCT__ the power to learn __PUNCT__ to discov __PUNCT__ to grow __PUNCT__ to reach on god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
so as presid __PUNCT__ i work to pass and then sign my bipartisan educ for all act to help provid a qualiti __PUNCT__ basic educ for everi singl child around the world __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ to end aid __PUNCT__ we need to stand up for women right __PUNCT__
aid take a particularli harsh toll on women and girl __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ percent of peopl live with aid in sub __PUNCT__ saharan africa ar women __PUNCT__
thei ar young girl who ar taken in marriag or in rape __PUNCT__
thei ar women who ar abus and mistreat __PUNCT__ who have no sai in their own live __PUNCT__ who work from sun up to sun down __PUNCT__ who never believ thei have ani wai to speak up or be heard __PUNCT__
their societi and their countri don't recogn their right to health care or educ __PUNCT__
thei don't particip in the economi in a formal wai __PUNCT__ although their work keep peopl aliv and thrive __PUNCT__
i rememb onc drive through africa on a bu with a group of distinguish expert and in field after field and marketplac after marketplac we saw women work __PUNCT__ women work hard __PUNCT__ carri firewood __PUNCT__ carri water __PUNCT__ sell their product in the villag __PUNCT__
and the economist said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it too bad that all of their work doesn't matter in the formal economi __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if thei stop all of their work __PUNCT__ the formal economi would collaps __PUNCT__
and it is time we pai tribut and respect to the hard work of such women __PUNCT__
and it is long past time that we do everyth we can to stand up for the proposit that women right ar human right __PUNCT__
as i saw so starkli at that shelter in thailand __PUNCT__ girl deni their human right ar girl at risk of aid __PUNCT__
and even in our own countri todai __PUNCT__ women ar now the face of aid __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i went to beij on behalf of our countri for the unit nation fourth world confer on women __PUNCT__
i said what most of us believ here in america __PUNCT__ that women right ar human right __PUNCT__ but it wa consid a radic statement __PUNCT__
i rememb be on the voic of america shortli after i came back __PUNCT__
it wa a call in radio show that wa beam throughout the world and a caller from iran call and he ask me __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what did i mean by sai that women right were human right __PUNCT__ and i said __PUNCT__ i want you to stop for a minut __PUNCT__ mayb close your ey and think about all the right you have as a man __PUNCT__
the right to work __PUNCT__ the right to pursu an educ __PUNCT__ the right to start a busi __PUNCT__ the right to be activ in your countri affair __PUNCT__
those ar the right i talk about __PUNCT__
the right that ar the real core of who we ar as human be __PUNCT__
it import we continu to work to empow women to take respons for themselv and their futur with initi on everyth from matern health to micro __PUNCT__ credit and entrepreneurship __PUNCT__
i continu the work i start as first ladi and now as a senat to end the bui and sell of girl and women into modern __PUNCT__ dai slaveri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know thi won't be easi __PUNCT__
but i also know the power of america at our best __PUNCT__ and i know the power of faith and of peopl of faith __PUNCT__ when we heed isaiah call to lift up our voic like trumpet __PUNCT__
the faith commun lift up it voic against slaveri and help lead america to end that evil __PUNCT__
the faith commun lift it voic against discrimin here in america and against apartheid in south africa and help end both __PUNCT__
the faith commun lift it voic for debt relief for the world poorest countri __PUNCT__ and gave mani countri a fresh start in the jubile year __PUNCT__
todai the faith commun is speak out against genocid in darfur __PUNCT__
take on global warm and we can see from thi room the awesom power to address the aid pandem __PUNCT__
togeth i believ __PUNCT__ we can write the next chapter in thi histori __PUNCT__
it is a proud and grace __PUNCT__ fill histori __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ thank you to saddleback __PUNCT__
thank to all of you for the work you ar do and for live your faith in such a visibl wai __PUNCT__
and i appreci the opportun to add my voic to your __PUNCT__
