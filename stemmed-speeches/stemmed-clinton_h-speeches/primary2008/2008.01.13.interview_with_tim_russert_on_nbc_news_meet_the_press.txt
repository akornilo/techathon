russert __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ welcom back to meet the press __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ thank __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
good to be with you __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ when we arriv in south carolina yesterdai thi wa the state newspap __PUNCT__ and the headlin agre to thi __PUNCT__
and let me share it with you and our viewer __PUNCT__ clinton camp hit obama __PUNCT__ attack __PUNCT__ pain __PUNCT__ for black voter __PUNCT__
mani in state offend by critic of obama __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ remark about __PUNCT__ martin luther __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__
bob herbert __PUNCT__ in the new york time __PUNCT__ columnist __PUNCT__ weigh in thi wai __PUNCT__ i could also sens how hard the clinton camp wa work to undermin senat obama main theme __PUNCT__ that a campaign base on hope and heal could unifi rather than further polar the countri __PUNCT__
so there wa the former presid chastis the press for the wai it wa cover the obama campaign and sai of mr __PUNCT__ obama effort __PUNCT__ the whole thing is the biggest fairi tale i ever seen __PUNCT__
and there wa mr __PUNCT__ clinton tell the countri we don't need __PUNCT__ fals hope __PUNCT__ and take cheap shot at __PUNCT__ of all peopl __PUNCT__ the reverend dr __PUNCT__ martin luther king jr __PUNCT__ we alreadi seen clinton surrog try to implant the fals idea that mr __PUNCT__ obama might be a muslim __PUNCT__ and perhap a drug dealer to boot __PUNCT__
what is thi all about __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ beat me __PUNCT__ becaus there not on shred of truth in what you just read __PUNCT__
and i regret that __PUNCT__ becaus obvious a lot of peopl have been __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ given inform or an impress that is absolut fals __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ with respect to dr __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i wa __NUM__ year old when i heard dr __PUNCT__ king speak in person __PUNCT__
he is on of the peopl that i admir most in the world __PUNCT__ and the point that i wa respond to from senat obama himself in a number of speech he wa make is hi comparison of himself to presid kennedi and dr __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__
and there is no doubt that the inspir offer by all three of them is essenti __PUNCT__
it is critic to who we ar as a nation __PUNCT__ what we believ in __PUNCT__ the dream and aspir that we all have __PUNCT__
but i also said that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ dr __PUNCT__ king didn't just give speech __PUNCT__
he march __PUNCT__ he organ __PUNCT__ he protest __PUNCT__ he wa gass __PUNCT__ he wa beaten __PUNCT__ he wa jail __PUNCT__
he understood that he had to move the polit process and bring in those who were in polit power __PUNCT__ and he campaign for polit leader __PUNCT__ includ lyndon johnson __PUNCT__ becaus he want somebodi in the white hous who would act on what he had devot hi life to achiev __PUNCT__
so i think it import to set the record straight __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ we know from media report that the obama campaign is deliber distort thi __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i think we should just take a step out here for a minut __PUNCT__
thi is the most excit elect we had in such a long time becaus you have an african american __PUNCT__ an extraordinari man __PUNCT__ a person of tremend talent and abil __PUNCT__ run to becom our presid __PUNCT__
you have a woman run to break the highest and hardest glass ceil __PUNCT__
i don't think either of us want to inject race or gender in thi campaign __PUNCT__
we ar run as individu __PUNCT__ we ar make our case to the american peopl __PUNCT__ and it imper that we get the record and the fact straight becaus peopl ar entitl to have that inform __PUNCT__
but i have no intent of either __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ do someth that would move thi race in a wrong wai __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ sit stand by when i think tactic ar be emploi that ar not in the best interest of our countri __PUNCT__
and let me address the point that bill wa make __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i think it been unfairli and inaccur character __PUNCT__
what he wa talk about wa veri directli about the stori of senat obama campaign __PUNCT__ be premis on a speech he gave in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and that wa to hi credit __PUNCT__
he gave a speech oppos the war in iraq __PUNCT__
he gave a veri impass speech against it and consist said that he wa against the war __PUNCT__ he would vote against the fund for the war __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ that speech wa off hi web site __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ he wa sai that he didn't realli disagre with the wai georg bush wa conduct the war __PUNCT__
and by __NUM__ and __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ he wa vote for __MONEY__ billion in fund for the war __PUNCT__
the stori of hi campaign is realli the stori of that speech and hi opposit to iraq __PUNCT__
i think it is fair to ask question about __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what did you do after the speech wa over __PUNCT__ and when he becam a senat __PUNCT__ he didn't go to the floor of the senat to condemn the war in iraq for __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
he didn't introduc legisl against the war in iraq __PUNCT__
he vote against timelin and deadlin initi __PUNCT__
so i think it import that we get the contrast and the comparison out __PUNCT__
i think that fair game __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i think that we don't want anyon __PUNCT__ ani of our support __PUNCT__ anyon __PUNCT__ and that why in my campaign __PUNCT__ ani time anybodi ha said anyth that i thought wa out of bound __PUNCT__ thei gone __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i have gotten rid of them __PUNCT__ i have said that is not appropri in thi campaign __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when senat obama chief strategist accus me of plai a role in benazir bhutto assassin __PUNCT__ there silenc __PUNCT__
so let have on standard __PUNCT__
thi is an excit and histor campaign __PUNCT__
on of us is go to make histori __PUNCT__ which is thrill to me __PUNCT__
i work all my life on behalf of civil right and women right and human right __PUNCT__ and so i want a good __PUNCT__ vigor campaign about the differ between us and our variou qualif and experi to be the presid that america need __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ it just isn't at senat obama who is take offens __PUNCT__
thi is exactli what presid clinton said in dartmouth __PUNCT__
here the tape __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ hanov __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ mondai __PUNCT__ pre __PUNCT__

clinton __PUNCT__ the entir quot wa clearli about the posit on iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but i __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ it wa not about the entir candidaci __PUNCT__
it wa not about the extraordinari __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ abil __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but congressman __PUNCT__ but congressman clyburn ha been cover thi race __PUNCT__
donna brazil __PUNCT__ herself a longtim activist in the democrat parti __PUNCT__ thi is what she said __PUNCT__
here donna brazil __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ tuesdai __PUNCT__ ms __PUNCT__
donna brazil __PUNCT__ as an african american __PUNCT__ i find hi word and hi tone to be veri depress __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ so these ar peopl who ar not support of obama __PUNCT__ who ar listen __PUNCT__
let me just go to the martin luther king thing becaus you had your opportun to talk about thi at the begin of the show and i want to lai thi out for our viewer __PUNCT__
thi is how the new york time categor it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in an interview with fox new on mondai __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__
tri to make a point about presidenti leadership __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ dr __PUNCT__
king dream began to be realiz when presid johnson pass the civil right act of __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ clinton said in try to make the case that her experi should mean to voter than the uplift word of mr __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it took a presid to get it done __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ congressman clyburn __PUNCT__ we have to be veri __PUNCT__ veri care about how we speak about that era in american polit __PUNCT__
that bother me a great deal __PUNCT__
a writer in the washington post todai __PUNCT__ a black woman said it as if you ar minim __PUNCT__ i have a dream __PUNCT__
that you sai it a nice sentiment __PUNCT__ but it took a white presid to get black to the mountaintop __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ that her take __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i understand the take out of context and the mischaracter __PUNCT__
i spoken with congressman clyburn __PUNCT__
i have spoken with a number of my veri strong and adam support __PUNCT__ but tim __PUNCT__ i can't let you get awai with that mischaracter and those snippet __PUNCT__
i wa respond to a speech that senat obama gave in new hampshir where he did compar himself to presid kennedi and to dr __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ presid kennedi serv in the congress for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ he wa a war hero __PUNCT__
he been engag in mani of the battl that led to hi elect in the __NUM__ elect __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ king had been on the front line __PUNCT__
he had been lead a movement __PUNCT__
but dr __PUNCT__ king understood __PUNCT__ which is why he made it veri clear __PUNCT__ that there ha to be a come to term of our countri polit in order to make the chang that would last for gener beyond the icon __PUNCT__ extraordinari speech that he gave __PUNCT__
that why he campaign for lyndon johnson in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that why he wa there when those great piec of legisl were pass __PUNCT__
doe he deserv the lion share of the credit for move our countri and move our polit process __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ he doe __PUNCT__
but he also had partner who were in the polit system __PUNCT__
and i think it is such an unfair and unwarr attempt to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ misinterpret and mischaracter what i said __PUNCT__
look at what i done my entir life __PUNCT__
i have been work on behalf of civil right __PUNCT__ women right __PUNCT__ human right for year and i know how challeng it is to chang our polit system and i have the highest regard for those who have put themselv on the line __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ congressman clyburn wa part of that movement __PUNCT__
so mani of the peopl whom i admir in my countri who have given of themselv to make these chang went into polit in order to realiz the chang __PUNCT__ work to elect peopl in order to make the chang __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thi is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ an unfortun stori line that the obama campaign ha push veri successfulli __PUNCT__
thei been put out talk point __PUNCT__ thei been make thi __PUNCT__ thei been tell peopl in a veri select wai what the fact ar __PUNCT__
and i glad to have the opportun to set the fact straight __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in newsweek __PUNCT__ you gave an interview to jon meacham __PUNCT__ and you talk about the person narr that candid develop __PUNCT__
you seem to compar barack obama to __PUNCT__ you sai __PUNCT__ demagogu like huei long __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ that is so untru and unfair __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ if you ar run for presid base primarili on a speech you gave in __NUM__ and speech you have given sinc __PUNCT__ most notabl at the democrat convent __PUNCT__ then i think it is fair to sai we need to know more beyond the word __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ if you ar part of american polit histori __PUNCT__ you know that the speech ar essenti to frame an issu __PUNCT__ to inspir and lift up peopl __PUNCT__
but when the camera ar gone and when the light ar out __PUNCT__ what happen next __PUNCT__ how do you translat your word into deed __PUNCT__ and i think __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ start in new hampshir it becam clear that on of the signific contrast in thi campaign is between talk and do __PUNCT__ between rhetor and realiti __PUNCT__
and i have the greatest regard for rhetor and particularli the abil that senat obama ha to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ lift our sight and our heart with hi oratori __PUNCT__
but i think it is fair to point out that he ha not had a record of actual produc posit chang __PUNCT__
translat those word into action is someth that is the __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the slow __PUNCT__ hard __PUNCT__ bore of hard board in polit __PUNCT__ and i think that peopl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ deserv to ask themselv question about that contrast __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you us the term in newsweek you be a work hors __PUNCT__ and suggest he a show hors __PUNCT__
isn't that a bit patron __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
there a wonder phrase in senat lexicon whether senat ar show hors or work hors __PUNCT__
and what i wa sai is that when i arriv in the senat in __NUM__ a lot of peopl thought i be a show hors __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ somebodi who frankli wa on your show all the time __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ somebodi who wa do the press confer all the time __PUNCT__
but i said to my colleagu the veri first dai that we went into session __PUNCT__ i intend to be a work hors __PUNCT__ becaus i think it import the result you deliv for peopl __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ is senat obama a work hors or a show hors __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i wa talk about myself __PUNCT__
i believ i am a work hors __PUNCT__
i believ that that is what our countri need right now __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ roll up our sleev collect as a nation and tackl the problem that we confront __PUNCT__
and that what i been do __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ here in south carolina __PUNCT__ __NUM__ children have healthcar becaus of the children health insur plan that i help to creat __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in new hampshir __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ the famou scene in portsmouth where you show some emot __PUNCT__ wa that exhaust __PUNCT__ frustrat __PUNCT__ what wa it __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
it wa actual __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ a moment of real emot connect __PUNCT__
those of us who ar run for offic and hold offic __PUNCT__ i know it mai be hard to believ __PUNCT__ we also human be __PUNCT__
and when i spend my time out on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ it usual about what i can do for somebodi els __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i veri other direct __PUNCT__
i don't like talk about myself __PUNCT__ i don't like __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ sort of the __PUNCT__ the whole atmospher of how peopl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ ar judg in american polit too often as to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what you sai instead of what you do __PUNCT__
and so for me it alwai about what can i do for you __PUNCT__ how can i help you __PUNCT__ and i wa veri touch when that woman said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how ar you do __PUNCT__ how do you get up in the morn __PUNCT__ becaus realli __PUNCT__ the question is for so mani of the peopl that i meet __PUNCT__ how doe anybodi get up in the morn __PUNCT__ i just went door __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ door in la vega __PUNCT__
i met construct worker who lost their job __PUNCT__ i met a man who been laid off from the casino becaus the economi is begin to go down __PUNCT__
i meet peopl who can't get healthcar for their famili __PUNCT__ peopl who ar just distress over __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what is happen in our countri __PUNCT__
so when somebodi ask me __PUNCT__ how do you get up __PUNCT__ it realli trigger in me __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the feel that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that what i __PUNCT__ i want us all to think about each other __PUNCT__
how do we get up __PUNCT__ how do we __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ pull on our shoe __PUNCT__ go out and deal with the problem america face __PUNCT__
that what i intend to do as presid __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the woman who ask the question said the next dai that she wound up vote for barack obama __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ becaus after your emot moment __PUNCT__ she said that __PUNCT__ you stiffen up and took on a polit postur again __PUNCT__ and said that some __PUNCT__ some of us ar right __PUNCT__ some of us ar wrong __PUNCT__ some of us ar readi and some of us ar not __PUNCT__
do you believ that barack obama is readi to be presid __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ thi is up to the voter of our countri to determin __PUNCT__
but i want them to have accur inform about our respect record __PUNCT__ what we accomplish __PUNCT__ the work that each of us have done when given a chanc to serv __PUNCT__
and i think it is relev __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we face huge problem at home and around the world __PUNCT__
nobodi can diminish those __PUNCT__
and the next presid is go to walk into that oval offic on dai on have to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ have to deal with what happen in afghanistan __PUNCT__ the middl east and across the world __PUNCT__ deal with our tough problem from the economi go south to __NUM__ million peopl uninsur __PUNCT__
and i think we go to need a presid who ha realli prepar and thought about what to do on that veri first dai __PUNCT__
that is __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but is __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that is my case to __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but is barack obama readi to be presid __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ that is up for voter to decid __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ you can ask that question of him __PUNCT__ voter can ask that question __PUNCT__ but that what i want __PUNCT__
i thought the campaign realli start at the debat in new hampshir __PUNCT__
for the first time we realli had a debat that compar and contrast our record __PUNCT__
when senat obama wa ask __PUNCT__ what is your major accomplish in the senat __PUNCT__ he said it wa pass ethic reform and get legisl to be prohibit from have lunch with lobbyist __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ charli gibson said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__
you can have lunch if you stand up __PUNCT__ not if you sit down __PUNCT__
so if that hi main claim for legisl accomplish __PUNCT__ peopl deserv to know that __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ in new hampshir __PUNCT__ we had an atmospher where tough question were ask and answer __PUNCT__
i answer hundr and hundr of question __PUNCT__ saw thousand and thousand of peopl __PUNCT__ and i think that the result realli speak to what peopl ar hungri for __PUNCT__
thei want to get beyond __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ just the coverag of the campaign __PUNCT__ to realli understand what motiv us __PUNCT__ what we bring to thi campaign __PUNCT__ and what we will do as presid __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if you don't think senat obama is readi to be presid __PUNCT__ then he wouldn't be readi for vice presid __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i not __PUNCT__ you onc again take word i didn't sai __PUNCT__
i ask peopl to compar and contrast our record __PUNCT__
i believ that we need a presid readi on dai on __PUNCT__
i put forth my qualif __PUNCT__ my experi __PUNCT__ my __NUM__ year of proven __PUNCT__ test leadership __PUNCT__ sometim __PUNCT__ as you well know __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ walk through the fire __PUNCT__ be prepar to take on whatev the republican send our wai __PUNCT__
i want peopl to make an inform decis __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i trust voter __PUNCT__
voter decid on whatev basi thei think is import to them __PUNCT__
i just want them to have a full rang of inform to make that decis __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ we had the event in new hampshir __PUNCT__ the so __PUNCT__ call emot event __PUNCT__
when i did the debat with rick lazio __PUNCT__ with you in buffalo in __NUM__ mr __PUNCT__ lazio walk over to your podium and ask you to sign a document that ban soft monei __PUNCT__ and peopl said that he had violat your space __PUNCT__
on of your campaign advis said he wa menac __PUNCT__
after the philadelphia debat __PUNCT__ your campaign said that the men were pile on __PUNCT__ which led some women __PUNCT__ comment __PUNCT__ writer __PUNCT__ to sai thi __PUNCT__
maureen dowd __PUNCT__ if the gender game work when rick lazio muscl into her space __PUNCT__ why shouldn't it work when obama and edward muster some mettl __PUNCT__ if she could becom a senat by plai the victim __PUNCT__
sure she can becom presid by plai the victim now __PUNCT__
ruth marcu __PUNCT__ washington post __PUNCT__ hillari clinton doesn't need to plai the woman __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ victim card __PUNCT__ us gender thi wai is a setback __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i don't think that either of us should us gender __PUNCT__
i don't think thi campaign is about gender __PUNCT__ and i sure hope it not about race __PUNCT__
it need to be about the individu __PUNCT__
each of us is run for the highest posit __PUNCT__ the most difficult job in the world __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i am __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ veri clearli someon who gone through a tremend amount of critic __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__
that fine __PUNCT__
i more than will to shoulder that __PUNCT__
i think voter and viewer can draw their own conclus when thei watch whatev it is that we ar do __PUNCT__
and i believ that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ for me __PUNCT__ thi is about who is readi on dai on __PUNCT__
and much of what i gone through in my entir life is __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ prepar for be abl to go into that oval offic __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ i bring the experi of women __PUNCT__
as a daughter __PUNCT__ as a mother __PUNCT__ as a wife __PUNCT__ as a sister __PUNCT__
that is who i am __PUNCT__
those experi ar part of me __PUNCT__
and it is part of our american journei that we have move through so much of what us to hold peopl back becaus of gender __PUNCT__ becaus of race __PUNCT__
ar we there yet __PUNCT__ is the journei over __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__ and i don't think ani fair person would sai that __PUNCT__
so we still have to overcom barrier and obstacl __PUNCT__
and the veri fact that barack and i ar in thi campaign __PUNCT__ each of us have won on of the first two contest __PUNCT__ be prepar to take our case to the countri __PUNCT__ i think will do more to put to rest so mani of these old shibboleth __PUNCT__ and all of the __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ kind of commentari and punditri __PUNCT__
just look at us as individu __PUNCT__
take us as to who we ar __PUNCT__ analyz our record __PUNCT__ compar and contrast us __PUNCT__ and then let the american peopl make their own decis __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ let me turn to iraq __PUNCT__
you brought it up __PUNCT__
presid bush had talk to gener petraeu the other dai __PUNCT__
gener petraeu is to report back to congress in march __PUNCT__
if gener petraeu sai the surg is work __PUNCT__ that reconcili start in a big wai yesterdai when the iraqi parliament said that former member of the saddam govern can particip in new govern __PUNCT__ don't pull __NUM__ troop out now __PUNCT__ keep them there for at least the remaind of the year __PUNCT__ would you be open to that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ and here why __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
the surg wa certainli explain and ration as give the iraqi govern space and time to make the hard decis that thei need to make __PUNCT__
__NUM__ wa the deadliest year for american troop __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ from my perspect __PUNCT__ part of the reason that the iraqi ar do anyth is becaus thei see thi elect happen and thei know thei don't have much time __PUNCT__ that the blank check that georg bush gave them is about to be torn up __PUNCT__
i have said that as soon as i becom presid __PUNCT__ i will ask the joint chief __PUNCT__ secretari of defens __PUNCT__ my secur advis to give me a plan to begin withdraw our troop within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
the reason i have to do that is becaus last spring __PUNCT__ i ask for a brief on what the plan wa __PUNCT__
secretari of defens and the depart of defens basic said __PUNCT__ we not go to tell you __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ ye you ar __PUNCT__
we had such a brief __PUNCT__
it wa classifi __PUNCT__
i can't talk about it __PUNCT__ but the bottom line is it wa cursori __PUNCT__
i don't think that the bush white hous want there to be much plan __PUNCT__
so start on dai on of my presid __PUNCT__ we will begin that plan __PUNCT__
we will begin to withdraw our troop within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
i think we can take out on to two brigad a month __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ i will put increas pressur on the iraqi govern __PUNCT__
i will engag in a full diplomat effort to work with the countri in the region and other who have an interest in the stabil of iraq __PUNCT__
but tim __PUNCT__ i think that the larg part of the reason that we see the iraqi govern do anyth is becaus time is run out __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ i believ presid bush will give them the rest of thi year no matter what we try to do __PUNCT__ and we don't have the vote to revers cours __PUNCT__
but as of __DATE__ we will begin to bring our troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ i certainli believ it in the interest of the iraqi govern and the peopl of iraq that a lot of thi reconcili that i been call for go back four or five year start and actual get implement now __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if gener petraeu sai __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ you call the surg the suspens of belief __PUNCT__
it ha work __PUNCT__ and you know it work __PUNCT__ let me finish __PUNCT__ you can see on the ground __PUNCT__
i sai to you __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ or presid __PUNCT__ elect clinton __PUNCT__ don't destroi iraq __PUNCT__
it work __PUNCT__ the surg is work __PUNCT__
keep troop there just a few more month to get thi reconcili complet __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i go to go back to what the whole point of the surg wa __PUNCT__ and the testimoni that we heard last fall __PUNCT__
the point of the surg wa to push the iraqi govern to make these tough choic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if we put in __NUM__ of our finest young men and women __PUNCT__ who ar go to go after the bad gui and quell violenc in certain part of iraq __PUNCT__ there no doubt that can be done __PUNCT__
the partnership that have been creat by the tribal sheik in anbar provinc and elsewher gave us an extra advantag __PUNCT__
but that doesn't in ani wai undermin the basic realiti __PUNCT__
the point of the surg wa to quickli move the iraqi govern and iraqi peopl __PUNCT__
that is onli now begin to happen __PUNCT__ and i believ in larg measur becaus the iraqi govern __PUNCT__ thei watch us __PUNCT__ thei listen to us __PUNCT__
i know veri well that thei follow everyth that i sai __PUNCT__
and my commit to begin withdraw our troop in __DATE__ of __NUM__ is a big factor __PUNCT__ as it is with senat obama __PUNCT__ senat edward __PUNCT__ those of us on the democrat side __PUNCT__
it is a big factor in push the iraqi govern to final do what thei should have been do all along __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ let me bring you back to __DATE__ of __NUM__ when the senat had to vote on the author to go to war __PUNCT__
thi wa senat clinton on the floor of the senat __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ so it is with convict that i support thi resolut as be in the best interest of our nation __PUNCT__
and it is a vote that sai clearli to saddam hussein __PUNCT__ thi is your last chanc __PUNCT__
disarm or be disarm __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ cast your vote for convict for the author for us of militari forc against iraq resolut __PUNCT__
that same week senat obama gave a speech __PUNCT__ and thi is what he said __PUNCT__ i know that saddam pose no immin and direct threat to the unit state __PUNCT__ or to hi neighbor __PUNCT__
i know that even a success war against iraq will requir a u. __PUNCT__ occup of undetermin length __PUNCT__ at undetermin cost __PUNCT__ with undetermin consequ __PUNCT__
i know that __PUNCT__ invas of iraq without a clear rational __PUNCT__ without strong intern support will onli fan the flame of the middl east __PUNCT__ and encourag the worst __PUNCT__ rather than the best __PUNCT__ impuls of the arab world __PUNCT__ and strengthen the recruit arm of al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__
i am not oppos to all war __PUNCT__
i oppos to dumb war __PUNCT__
who had the better judgment at that time __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ let put thi in context __PUNCT__
you didn't show my entir speech __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ you don't have time to do that __PUNCT__ becaus i made it veri clear that my vote wa not a vote for preemptiv war __PUNCT__
i said that on the floor __PUNCT__ i said it consist after that __PUNCT__
it wa a vote to put inspector back in to determin what threat saddam hussein did in fact pose __PUNCT__
and in senat obama recent book __PUNCT__ he clearli sai he thought that saddam hussein had chemic and biolog weapon __PUNCT__ and that he still covet nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
hi judgment wa that __PUNCT__ at the time in __NUM__ we didn't need to make ani effort __PUNCT__
my belief wa we did need to pin saddam down __PUNCT__ put inspector in __PUNCT__
but i said i wa against preemptiv war __PUNCT__ i spoke out against it __PUNCT__
but let look at the __PUNCT__ let look at the __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__ let me finish __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ it import __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ let look at the entir context __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let just __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ becaus by __NUM__ tim __PUNCT__ by the summer of __NUM__ senat obama said he wasn't sure how he would have vote __PUNCT__
and when you ask him about that __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he didn't want to sai someth that could have hurt our nomine __PUNCT__ senat kerri and senat edward __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the fact is he alwai said he doesn't take posit for polit reason __PUNCT__
that is a polit explan __PUNCT__
if he wa against the war in __NUM__ he should strongli spoke out in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
he should follow what he said in hi speech __PUNCT__ which wa that he would not vote for fund in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ and __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that is inconsist with what he is now run hi campaign on __PUNCT__
the stori of hi campaign is premis on that speech __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ viewer can read the transcript from __DATE__ when i did talk to senat obama about thi __PUNCT__
he also ad that from hi vantag point __PUNCT__ the administr had not made the case __PUNCT__ but let peopl read it and make up their own mind __PUNCT__
i want to stai with your vote becaus that same dai __PUNCT__ senat levin offer an amend __PUNCT__ the levin amend __PUNCT__ and thi is how the new york time report it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ levin __PUNCT__ amend call __PUNCT__ for the u.n __PUNCT__ to pass a new resolut explicitli approv the us of forc against iraq __PUNCT__
it also requir the presid to return to congress if hi u.n __PUNCT__ effort fail __PUNCT__
senat levin said __PUNCT__ allow congress to vote onli after exhaust all option with the unit state __PUNCT__
you did not particip in that vote __PUNCT__
you vote against carl levin __PUNCT__ who wa sai give diplomaci a chanc and yet you said no __PUNCT__
you vote to author war __PUNCT__
the resolut you vote for __PUNCT__ robert byrd said wa a blank check for georg bush __PUNCT__
ted kennedi sai it wa a vote for war __PUNCT__
jame carvil and paul begala said anyon who sai that vote wasn't a vote for war is bunk __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ if i had a lot of paper in front of me __PUNCT__ i could quot peopl who sai someth veri differ __PUNCT__ so i know you veri good at thi and i respect it __PUNCT__ but let look at the context here __PUNCT__
number on __PUNCT__ the levin amend __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ gave the secur council of the unit nation a veto over american presidenti power __PUNCT__
i don't believ that is an appropri polici for the unit state __PUNCT__ no matter who is our presid __PUNCT__
number two __PUNCT__ i have the greatest respect for senat levin __PUNCT__
he is my chairman on the senat arm servic committe __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ immedi after we did have the vote on the author __PUNCT__ went to work with him to try to make sure that everi piec of intellig we had wa given to the u.n __PUNCT__ inspector __PUNCT__
and senat levin and i sent a letter to secretari powel __PUNCT__ we push that posit veri hard becaus we both had the same view that we were go to put inspector back in and we need to let the inspector do the job that thei were ask to do __PUNCT__
number three __PUNCT__ i actual join with senat byrd on an amend that would limit the presid author to on year __PUNCT__
i wa veri strongli in favor of limit what presid bush could do __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ that amend did not pass __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ it is absolut unfair to sai that the vote as chuck hagel __PUNCT__ who wa on of the architect of the resolut __PUNCT__ ha said __PUNCT__ wa a vote for war __PUNCT__
it wa a vote to us the threat of forc against saddam hussein __PUNCT__ who never did anyth without be made to do so __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the titl of the act wa the author for us of militari forc against iraq resolut __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ that wa exactli what would happen if we weren't success with the diplomaci and if we weren't success in persuad hussein to do someth __PUNCT__
and let me just add here that when we were move toward the preemptiv war that georg bush decid to wage __PUNCT__ the inspector were in iraq __PUNCT__ we were get inform __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ that would give us a basi for know __PUNCT__
i believ if the inspector had been allow to do their work __PUNCT__ we would learn that what saddam hussein had construct wa a charad __PUNCT__
it could veri well brought him down by hi own peopl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we can sit here and argu about __NUM__ or we can sai what ha happen sinc and what need to happen go forward in the futur __PUNCT__
and i think that you have two differ stori line here __PUNCT__
you have senat obama stori line __PUNCT__ the speech he gave in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to hi credit __PUNCT__ which then wa not follow up on __PUNCT__
by __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it wa off hi web site __PUNCT__
by __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ he wa sai he didn't know he would vote and that he basic agre with georg bush on the conduct of the war __PUNCT__
there were other __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ who vote against it __PUNCT__ spoke out against it and never waver over that period of time __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you vote for all the fund for the war __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
i never __PUNCT__ i not premis my campaign on someth differ __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and then until __PUNCT__ __NUM__ wa against the timet __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ but i did what i __PUNCT__ my principl concern ha alwai been do what i thought wa best for our countri and what i thought wa best for our troop __PUNCT__
i not here sai anyth differ than that __PUNCT__
i not give you a stori line that doe not hold up __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but did he have better __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ __URL__ the fact and the time we were in __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ did he have better judgment in __DATE__ of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ judgment is not a singl snapshot __PUNCT__
judgment is what you do across the cours of your life and your career __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ a vote for war is a veri import vote __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ we can have thi jesuit argument about what exactli wa meant __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when chuck hagel __PUNCT__ who help to draft the resolut __PUNCT__ said it wa not a vote for war __PUNCT__ when i wa told directli by the white hous in respons to my question __PUNCT__ if you ar given thi author __PUNCT__ will you put the inspector in and permit them to finish their job __PUNCT__ i wa told that exactli what we intend to do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think it import to take a look at the entir context here __PUNCT__
if senat obama go to get credit for hi speech and hi posit against the war __PUNCT__ then he deserv to be ask what happen in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ and __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i vote for the author __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ i ask him those veri question __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ and hi answer wa veri polit __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ hi whole point is that he doesn't make polit decis __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ let me __PUNCT__ let me ask you thi wai __PUNCT__
dori kearn goodwin __PUNCT__ presidenti historian __PUNCT__ i talk to her and she been on meet the press __PUNCT__ talk about the qualiti in a presid __PUNCT__
and she said on of the most import is that you learn from mistak __PUNCT__
look back on your vote in __DATE__ of __NUM__ what can you learn from that mistak __PUNCT__ the wai you make decis in the futur __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i have said that obvious __PUNCT__ i would never do again what georg bush did with that vote __PUNCT__
he misus and abus the author that wa given to him __PUNCT__ in my opinion __PUNCT__
and we can't turn the clock back __PUNCT__
i taken respons for it __PUNCT__
it wa a sincer vote at the time __PUNCT__ base on my assess of __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ what the potenti __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ risk might be if left uncheck __PUNCT__ given the problem that we were face in the world with global terror __PUNCT__ and the hope that we would get inspector back in to figur out what had been go on sinc __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we hadn't had inspector sinc __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ i would not have given presid bush the author if i knew he would deliber misus and abus it __PUNCT__
and as i said __PUNCT__ i wa told by the white hous person that the point of the author wa to send a veri clear messag to saddam hussein that he wa go to have to be held account final __PUNCT__ that we would know onc and for all what he had there that could be us as he had us it in the past __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i think that it onli fair to look at the entir context __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i wa against a preemptiv war __PUNCT__
i said at the time that would be a mistak __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ presid bush doesn't listen to me or a lot of other peopl __PUNCT__ and unfortun __PUNCT__ we in the situat we ar now __PUNCT__ and we go to have to have veri care and steadi leadership to get us out with the least amount of damag __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ learn from mistak __PUNCT__ do you wish you had read the nation intellig estim __PUNCT__ which had a lot of caveat from the state depart and the energi depart as to whether or not saddam hussein realli had a biolog and chemic and activ nuclear program __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i wa fulli brief by the peopl who wrote that __PUNCT__
i wa brief by the peopl from __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the state depart __PUNCT__ the cia __PUNCT__ the depart of defens __PUNCT__ all of the variou player in that __PUNCT__
and mani peopl who read it __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ not veri mani peopl read the whole thing becaus we were get constant brief __PUNCT__
and peopl __PUNCT__ some peopl read it and vote for the resolut __PUNCT__ some peopl read it and vote against the resolut __PUNCT__
i felt veri well brief __PUNCT__
and it wasn't just what the bush administr wa tell us in the nie __PUNCT__ i went wai outsid of ani kind of bush administr sourc __PUNCT__ independ peopl __PUNCT__ peopl from the clinton administr __PUNCT__ peopl in the british govern __PUNCT__
i look as broadli as i could at how to assess thi __PUNCT__
and if __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ you see the vote as i saw it as oppos as how it been character __PUNCT__ i thought it wa a vote to put inspector back in __PUNCT__ to make it veri clear that saddam hussein wouldn't be abl to go off uncheck __PUNCT__
if those inspector had been permit to do the job that thei were set up to do __PUNCT__ we would have avoid war __PUNCT__
it becam clear in retrospect __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ onc peopl start write book and inform came out of the administr __PUNCT__ the presid had no intent of let the inspector do their job __PUNCT__
that not what i wa told by the bush white hous __PUNCT__
that not what we were told in constant brief from high __PUNCT__ level bush administr offici __PUNCT__
that not what the presid told the countri in hi speech in cincinnati shortli befor the vote __PUNCT__
if you rememb __PUNCT__ he said thi vote wa the best chanc to avoid some kind of confront __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ we go to take a quick break __PUNCT__
we be back in south carolina with more of our convers with senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__ democrat candid for presid __PUNCT__ right after thi __PUNCT__

clinton __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ your campaign ha talk about extens __PUNCT__
i want to go back to a debat back in __DATE__ of __NUM__ when a young governor from arkansa wa talk about experi __PUNCT__
let listen __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ pre __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i believ experi count __PUNCT__ but it not everyth __PUNCT__
we need a new approach __PUNCT__
the same old experi is not relev __PUNCT__
and you can have the right kind of experi and the wrong kind of experi __PUNCT__
mine is root in the real live of real peopl __PUNCT__ and it will bring real result if we have the courag to chang __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ that could been written by barack obama __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ by the time bill ran in __NUM__ he wa the senior most serv governor in our countri __PUNCT__
he had done a lot of work on the econom and trade issu that affect the state of arkansa __PUNCT__
and i do think that there not a contradict between experi and chang __PUNCT__
i think that thei have been somehow put in these oppos categori __PUNCT__ and i don't think that the wai that we make decis in our life __PUNCT__
what the question is is who ha the experi we need to make the chang we want __PUNCT__
and i believ that my experi over the cours of __NUM__ year of my life equip me veri well to do exactli what bill said in that clip __PUNCT__
i am root in the real live of real peopl __PUNCT__
that is what i care about __PUNCT__ that what motiv me __PUNCT__
that what i want to do as presid __PUNCT__
and so when i go out __PUNCT__ it is to talk with peopl about what i can do to help them __PUNCT__ and it is a reflect then of everyth that i have done over the cours of my life __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ as a public servant __PUNCT__ as a public offic holder __PUNCT__
i just think it imper that we quit thi fals distinct __PUNCT__
it is who ha the experi we need to make the chang we want __PUNCT__
and we need and want to have it happen in america __PUNCT__ and i believ that i am test and readi and prepar to do it __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we just spent the most __PUNCT__ the first part of the program talk about a speech and vote from __NUM__ __PUNCT__
what peopl ar talk to me about is the economi __PUNCT__
thei lose their job __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ econom activ is slow down __PUNCT__
we need to focu veri clearli on what we go to do to make thi economi as __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ readi to be abl to navig through the potenti of a recess __PUNCT__
we slip toward recess __PUNCT__
some peopl think we in recess right now __PUNCT__
and i propos a veri vigor packag of econom action that i think would __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ forestal and mayb __PUNCT__ hopefulli mitig against what is go on in the economi __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you don't pai for it __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i am probabl the strongest on fiscal respons in thi campaign __PUNCT__
senat edward __PUNCT__ i respect __PUNCT__ he said that not a prioriti for him __PUNCT__
senat obama put out a lot of hi polici without pai for them __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ billion __PUNCT__ as we have calcul __PUNCT__
i have paid for everyth __PUNCT__
i tell you how i will pai for my healthcar plan __PUNCT__ how i will pai for the american retir account __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but not for thi stimulu __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ but thi __PUNCT__ stimulu shouldn't be paid for __PUNCT__
the whole point of stimulu __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ as we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we go to be bring that monei home __PUNCT__
but the stimulu __PUNCT__ by the veri natur of the econom problem we face __PUNCT__ is go to requir an inject of feder fund __PUNCT__
and i would start with the mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i been do event in nevada and california __PUNCT__ which have veri high rate of mortgag foreclosur __PUNCT__
i want to have a moratorium on foreclosur for __NUM__ dai so we can try to work them out __PUNCT__
i want to freez interest rate for five year __PUNCT__ and i want to have a __MONEY__ billion packag that will go in and try to stabil the hous market and stabil commun that ar go to be affect by that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ mani peopl opt for those cheaper mortgag __PUNCT__
thei could had a fix mortgag at a higher rate __PUNCT__ but thei opt for a cheaper on __PUNCT__
should thei not bear some respons __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i think all of us should __PUNCT__
but i sai three thing about that __PUNCT__
the banker __PUNCT__ the mortgag lender __PUNCT__ the broker __PUNCT__ all bear a lot of the respons __PUNCT__ becaus mani of the practic that were follow were just downright predatori and fraudul __PUNCT__
there is no doubt about that __PUNCT__
i start talk about thi last march __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl got into subprim loan who frankli could been in a convent fix __PUNCT__ rate loan __PUNCT__
thei were basic told that thi wa a better opportun for them __PUNCT__
should thei take respons __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ but look at what will happen if we continu thi cascad of foreclosur __PUNCT__
hous valu ar down __PUNCT__
thei down __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
that over __MONEY__ trillion in hous valu in the last year __PUNCT__
so everybodi bear some respons __PUNCT__
i went to wall street last month to tell wall street thei had to be part of the solut becaus thei sure had been part of the problem __PUNCT__
what i have propos would begin to stabil the situat as it is todai __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ even alan greenspan said give monei to homeown so that thei can be abl to withstand the pressur of thi mortgag crisi __PUNCT__
i would do it a littl differ __PUNCT__ but i think the __PUNCT__ we see the same problem __PUNCT__
if we allow these foreclosur to continu __PUNCT__ we ar go to be face even a deeper and longer set of econom problem __PUNCT__
so i think we got to take action now __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you sai you been deepli involv in the eight year of the clinton administr __PUNCT__
on of the power given to a presid is the power of pardon __PUNCT__
at the end of the presid second term __PUNCT__ he grant __NUM__ pardon __PUNCT__ includ on to marc rich __PUNCT__ someon who had been convict of tax evas __PUNCT__ fraud and make illeg oil deal with iran __PUNCT__

and that doe sometim draw a littl bit of controversi and critic __PUNCT__
some of it organ __PUNCT__ but you know __PUNCT__ i just too busi to worri about that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the voter who vote for you in new hampshir were ask also who would be the most like to unit the countri __PUNCT__
and it wa quit interest __PUNCT__
thi is what thei said __PUNCT__ obama __NUM__ clinton __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that a state that you carri __PUNCT__ yet thei sai that barack obama would unit the countri __PUNCT__
why __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i believ that my record of unit new york __PUNCT__ of go to the senat __PUNCT__ when peopl said i wouldn't work with republican and republican wouldn't work with me __PUNCT__ is evid __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i am will to find common ground wherev i can __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ but i also know you have to stand your ground __PUNCT__
i don't believ that the polit system in washington will immedi just lie down and give up __PUNCT__
you know it better than anybodi __PUNCT__
the interest ar deepli entrench __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thei gone after me consist for __NUM__ year and i bear some scar from that becaus i have stood up against them on univers healthcar __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__
i proud of those scar becaus ye __PUNCT__ i will find common ground and creat solut to our problem __PUNCT__ but i am against a lot of what those on the other side want to do to our countri __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ a lot of democrat have __PUNCT__ ar concern about that __PUNCT__ as to whether you can win a gener elect __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ thi is new hampshir __PUNCT__
who most like to win the gener elect __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ thei sai obama by a margin of __NUM__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the wall street journal and nbc new had a poll where we match clinton __PUNCT__ huckabe to obama __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__
let me take you through that __PUNCT__
clinton is __NUM__ __PUNCT__ huckabe __NUM__ __PUNCT__
obama is __NUM__ __PUNCT__ huckabe __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and when you look at the independ voter __PUNCT__ it clinton __NUM__ huckabe __NUM__ __PUNCT__ obama win independ __NUM__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
obama get __NUM__ percent of the republican vote __PUNCT__
why is that __PUNCT__ why is there __PUNCT__ independ and republican resist to you __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ on think i think everybodi should learn after new hampshir is let not pai so much attent to poll __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__
we need to let voter actual make up their mind __PUNCT__ and voter who will see and judg each of us in the democrat primari and then in the gener elect __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there ar other poll we could put up done by other network and other kind of outlet that have differ result __PUNCT__
i don't pai much attent to ani of that __PUNCT__
i think that the fact is that we take our case to the american peopl __PUNCT__
we take it on a dai __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ dai __PUNCT__ week __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ week basi __PUNCT__
and i veri __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i veri gratifi by the posit respons __PUNCT__

whoever is nomin __PUNCT__ and it like to be senat obama or myself __PUNCT__ will get a fresh look by the peopl of america __PUNCT__ will get an increas amount of __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ question about who we ar and where we from __PUNCT__
becaus all of a sudden it becom real __PUNCT__
you cover thi for a long time __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when my husband ran in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ he final clinch the nomin in __DATE__ in california __PUNCT__
he wa run third behind presid bush and behind ross perot __PUNCT__
other of our candid on both side of the aisl start out behind and wage a win campaign __PUNCT__
so i think what peopl who ar concern about elect should be look at is number on __PUNCT__ who can be the best presid __PUNCT__ the best presid from dai on __PUNCT__ who is prepar __PUNCT__ who ha taken tough posit __PUNCT__ becaus you go to have to take them __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ senat obama vote present __NUM__ time in the state senat __PUNCT__
when you presid __PUNCT__ you can't vote present __PUNCT__
you have to make a decis __PUNCT__
sometim it a split second decis __PUNCT__
you don't have time to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ think about it __PUNCT__
you got to actual decid __PUNCT__
so i go to take the case to the countri as the nomine that i been test __PUNCT__ i been proven __PUNCT__
i have the experi we need to make the chang we want and i think that a win case __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ whomev the republican nomin __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in iowa __PUNCT__ you express concern that the time of the caucu prevent a lot of shift worker from vote __PUNCT__ thei were disenfranchis __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you mai confront the same thing in nevada __PUNCT__
thei have now schedul __PUNCT__ the state parti there __PUNCT__ to have caucus at the place of work so that shift worker can show up __PUNCT__
mani peopl __PUNCT__ minor particularli __PUNCT__ support of your __PUNCT__ have file a suit to try to stop have those caucu locat at the workplac __PUNCT__
do you support that suit __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i don't think it support of mine __PUNCT__
there seem to be some misunderstand about that __PUNCT__
i wa ask yesterdai in reno __PUNCT__
the teacher union who brought the suit ha not endors me __PUNCT__ and so i think their concern is to have as mani peopl particip as possibl __PUNCT__ which is certainli what it should be __PUNCT__
thi is now in the court __PUNCT__
the court and the state parti will have to work it out __PUNCT__
but i don't want to disenfranchis anybodi __PUNCT__
i want __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so why not drop the lawsuit and let peopl vote __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that up to the peopl who brought it __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what your view __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ but tim __PUNCT__ as i understand it __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of peopl work at mani place who won't be abl to work __PUNCT__
the place for do the caucu ar not at their workplac across the state __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ the caucu idea is for neighbor to get togeth to argu and talk about their choic __PUNCT__
the problem is that if you have a limit period of time __PUNCT__ as i point out long befor anyth happen in nevada __PUNCT__ you go to essenti leav peopl out who can't be there dure those on to two hour period of time __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i haven't read the lawsuit __PUNCT__
the coverag of it seem to suggest that some peopl ar sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__ what about us __PUNCT__ those ar not our workplac __PUNCT__
we have to be at work __PUNCT__
how ar we go to particip __PUNCT__ it up to the court to work that out __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ dori kearn goodwin said __PUNCT__ what the biggest public advers a person ha ever face __PUNCT__ what your __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we all know that __PUNCT__ we live through it __PUNCT__ didn't we __PUNCT__ and it someth that wa veri pain and veri hurt __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ what did you learn from it __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ it is who i am as a person __PUNCT__
i believ that you have to withstand whatev problem come your wai __PUNCT__
you have to make the decis that ar best for you __PUNCT__
you go to get a lot of advic come from mani differ quarter to do thing that don't feel right to you __PUNCT__ that don't reflect who you ar and what your valu ar __PUNCT__
so you have to be ground in who you ar and what you believ __PUNCT__
and you not alwai go to make the right decis __PUNCT__ but you have to be guid by what you think is import __PUNCT__ and that what i done __PUNCT__
