for me __PUNCT__ it ha been a long struggl to get to the point where barrier were knock down and door open and we still haven't complet that journei __PUNCT__
but it is the vote that ha given voic to the voiceless and power to the powerless __PUNCT__
it is through that vote that women __PUNCT__ african american __PUNCT__ latino and so mani other have claim their right as full and equal citizen __PUNCT__
we have made our law more just and our societi more fair __PUNCT__
each vote is a declar of our dream for our children and a reflect of our prayer for our nation futur __PUNCT__
that is why gener of brave men and women march and protest __PUNCT__ risk and gave their live for thi right __PUNCT__
it is becaus of them that both senat obama and i stand befor you as candid for the democrat nomin __PUNCT__
it is becaus of all those who came befor that we ar both in thi race todai __PUNCT__
we should carri on that legaci by sai clearli that we will protect and cherish the right to vote for all peopl __PUNCT__

i proud of the legisl i sponsor in the senat to assur that everi elig voter can count and everi vote is count and i will alwai defend your right to vote __PUNCT__ no matter whom you choos to vote for in the end __PUNCT__ it is not about that at all __PUNCT__
becaus i believ that michigan famili ar just as import as the famili of ani other state __PUNCT__
the father in detroit want the same opportun for hi children as the father in de moin __PUNCT__ and he deserv the same voic in the futur __PUNCT__
the mother in lans need access to health care just as much as the mother in lo angel __PUNCT__ and she deserv the same voic and how we will provid qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care to everyon __PUNCT__
the famili in the u.p __PUNCT__ need good pai job that stai right here in america just as much as the famili in central pa __PUNCT__ and thei deserv the same voic in try to get that done __PUNCT__
the soldier from across thi great state need a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief who will end the war in iraq and bring them home __PUNCT__
thei certainli deserv the same voic in choos that person __PUNCT__
that why i been sai for some time that the peopl of michigan and florida must have a voic in select our nomine for presid __PUNCT__
i have call repeatedli for an agreement that would seat michigan deleg at our nation convent __PUNCT__ becaus i believ your voic and your vote should count __PUNCT__
when other made the decis to remov their name from the ballot __PUNCT__ i didn't __PUNCT__ becaus i believ your voic and your vote should count __PUNCT__
that why i been sai we need to either count the vote that have alreadi been cast in michigan and florida or have new __PUNCT__ full __PUNCT__ and fair elect so that we can have your voic and your vote count __PUNCT__
senat obama speak passion on the campaign trail about empow the american peopl __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i urg him to match those word with action __PUNCT__ to make sure the peopl of michigan and florida have a voic and a vote in thi elect __PUNCT__
i have accept the plan for a new vote in michigan __PUNCT__ propos in draft legisl and approv by the democrat nation committe __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the dnc put out a statement earlier thi morn make clear that the propos fit within the dnc rule __PUNCT__
it is fulli within the parti rule __PUNCT__
i call on senat obama to do the same __PUNCT__
thi is a crucial test __PUNCT__
doe he mean what he sai or not __PUNCT__ i am pleas and grate that on thi issu __PUNCT__ the peopl of michigan have had such outstand advoc in their democrat leader __PUNCT__ and there ar so mani __PUNCT__ includ the governor and senat stabenow and member of the legislatur __PUNCT__
but i especi want to thank four who have realli been at the forefront __PUNCT__ senat carl levin __PUNCT__ congresswoman carolyn cheek kilpatrick __PUNCT__ debbi dingel and ron gettelfing of the uaw __PUNCT__
peopl in michigan and particularli democrat in michigan know that michigan matter __PUNCT__ both in the primari and in the gener elect __PUNCT__
the road to a democrat white hous goe through michigan and florida __PUNCT__
if democrat send the messag that we don't care about your vote __PUNCT__ i sure john mccain and the republican would be happi to have them __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the republican will argu that michigan and florida voter shouldn't trust the democrat to look out for them when we won't even listen to you __PUNCT__
ignor michigan and florida would be a grave mistak __PUNCT__
we won't be abl to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we won't achiev univers health care __PUNCT__ we won't end the hous crisi and get the economi move again unless we win in michigan and florida in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ it realli veri simpl __PUNCT__
we need your voic and you have a right to your vote __PUNCT__
i am proud to stand with the peopl of michigan in thi caus and i hope that senat obama will join me __PUNCT__ becaus when we look at the stake of thi elect __PUNCT__ thei could not be higher __PUNCT__
the next presid of the unit state will inherit a huge mess from georg w __PUNCT__ bush and we go to have to do a lot of clean up __PUNCT__
i can just imagin what it will be like to try to undo the damag that we will inherit plu take on the neglect agenda that the vote sand famili of michigan and american ar wait to have address __PUNCT__
i been criss __PUNCT__ cross our countri __PUNCT__ sai veri clearli that i offer solut __PUNCT__ __NUM__ centuri solut about how we go to get the economi move again and creat good job with particular emphasi on a state like michigan that deserv even more attent from the next presid becaus you been neglect and you been ignor and your need have been deni __PUNCT__
it wa amaz to me that the big three auto compani in the uaw had to beg for year just to have a meet with the presid __PUNCT__
i met with them more than the presid met with them __PUNCT__ and what we were wait for wa just a smidgen of presidenti leadership __PUNCT__ we didn't ask for a lot __PUNCT__
a littl would have been welcom __PUNCT__
some idea that __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ the auto industri and our big three manufactur and the hard __PUNCT__ work member of the uaw deserv some help as we make thi transit into a higher ga mileag economi __PUNCT__ as we look for wai to support innov from hybrid car to more flexibl fuel __PUNCT__
that all thei were look for __PUNCT__ a partner who would be with them in thi fight to save american job __PUNCT__ to make sure that we retain leadership global as we navig through a much more challeng economi __PUNCT__
but it didn't happen __PUNCT__
so we go to realli have to go into high gear start in __DATE__ becaus we go to have to make up for all the lost time and the lost opportun __PUNCT__
we have big challeng __PUNCT__ how ar we go to creat new job __PUNCT__ how ar we go to get the tax code to quit reward busi for export job out of michigan to foreign countri __PUNCT__ how ar we go to make that tax code fair and quit yield a lower tax rate to some wall street monei manag who make __NUM__ million dollar __PUNCT__ then what is paid by nurs __PUNCT__ a teacher or a truck driver make __MONEY__ right here in detroit or elsewher across michigan __PUNCT__ and what ar we go to do to final tackl our energi depend __PUNCT__ we can't live with __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__ oil and ga move up to __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
the averag american is go to just be bewild and distress try to figur out how to cover all the expens becaus the price of everyth is go up __PUNCT__ but wage ar not go up __PUNCT__
peopl ar not be reward for work harder __PUNCT__ do more __PUNCT__ and more __PUNCT__ and more __PUNCT__
how mani of you know someon with two __PUNCT__ and even three __PUNCT__ job that don't pai what us to be paid in the job thei us to have befor it wa export or done awai with __PUNCT__ and we cannot continu the moral outrag and the econom calam of have a health care system that doesn't cover everyon and continu to cost more and more and more everi singl year __PUNCT__
we got to move for univers health care and we got to do it quickli becaus we can't be global competit and expect to have our individu busi bear all these cost __PUNCT__
and we sure go to have to deal with our educ system __PUNCT__ with more opportun for children in the pre __PUNCT__ school year so that thei better prepar to go to school __PUNCT__ with univers pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten and more head start and earli childhood develop __PUNCT__
and i will end the unfund mandat known as no child left behind __PUNCT__ which hasn't work and is not work __PUNCT__
and we will make colleg afford again for young peopl from middl class and work famili __PUNCT__
there so much to be done here at home and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ around the world we have to restor america leadership and our moral author and that mean we got to begin end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
and i have been outlin thi week __PUNCT__ as we mark the fifth anniversari of georg bush preemptiv war that he wage __PUNCT__ i have been outlin plan as to what we can and must do to begin bring our son and daughter home __PUNCT__
i am convinc that we can start within __NUM__ dai and do it in a respons and care manner __PUNCT__ recogn that the iraqi govern ha to take respons for it own futur __PUNCT__ that we have given them the preciou gift of freedom and it is up to them to decid whether or not thei will us it __PUNCT__
but we cannot win their civil war __PUNCT__
there is no militari solut __PUNCT__
and as we bring our troop home we must take care of them __PUNCT__
our veteran deserv our greatest effort to fulfil our oblig to them __PUNCT__
get the healthcar and the other servic that thei have so richli earn and we got to have a __NUM__ centuri gi bill of right for these young men and women so thei can go to school or start a busi or bui a home __PUNCT__
so there a lot of work ahead but i am confid and optimist that we can do thi work togeth __PUNCT__
and i know that the next presid of the unit state is go to have to have a unit countri with everyon onc again believ that our best dai ar ahead __PUNCT__ and work to achiev big goal again like univers healthcar and energi independ and so much more __PUNCT__
