how do you respond __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think that my record and the elect that i been through demonstr that i more like __PUNCT__ at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ to be abl to attract voter who know how seriou the issu ar that we face __PUNCT__ with a war to end in iraq and a war to resolv in afghanistan __PUNCT__ an economi that is slip into a recess and not work for most peopl __PUNCT__
and i think it also clear that on issu after issu __PUNCT__ i can draw a veri stark contrast with senat mccain __PUNCT__ if he happen to be the nomine __PUNCT__
take health care __PUNCT__
i intend to go into the gener elect stand for a core democrat valu and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ a moral principl to me __PUNCT__ and that is univers health care __PUNCT__ everyon cover __PUNCT__ no except __PUNCT__ no excus __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__ i been take the incom fire from republican for about __NUM__ year now __PUNCT__ and i still here __PUNCT__ becaus i have been vet __PUNCT__ i have been test __PUNCT__
there unlik to be ani new surpris __PUNCT__
peopl understand who i am __PUNCT__ where i from __PUNCT__ what i do __PUNCT__ what i believ in __PUNCT__
and i think that i can go up against senat mccain or ani of the republican and be abl to defend our posit __PUNCT__ put them forward to the american peopl and make an affirm case as to why i should be the presid __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ the implic there __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is there could surpris with senat obama __PUNCT__
and your chief strategist __PUNCT__ mark penn __PUNCT__ put out a memo yesterdai where he made that point __PUNCT__
he said voter have veri littl inform about senat obama __PUNCT__ and onc the republican regim begin to method attack him __PUNCT__ he will lose independ support __PUNCT__
what don't those voter know about barack obama right now __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think it fair to sai __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__ that it not so much about him as it is about me __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i have been through these republican attack over and over and over again __PUNCT__ and i believ that i demonstr that __PUNCT__ much to the dismai of the republican __PUNCT__ i not onli can surviv __PUNCT__ but thrive __PUNCT__
i think that a veri import differ to take into thi elect __PUNCT__ becaus you know well __PUNCT__ as i do __PUNCT__ that the republican ar not go to go quietli awai __PUNCT__
thei want to win __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__
thei want to keep the white hous __PUNCT__
thei run a veri vigor campaign __PUNCT__
thei will end up be unit __PUNCT__ as we will __PUNCT__
and then it will be two peopl on the stage talk about who can protect and defend our countri __PUNCT__ who can restor our leadership and moral author around the world __PUNCT__ and who can actual produc result for the american peopl __PUNCT__
that what i will be talk about __PUNCT__
and i think i have a veri good chanc of be abl to make that case and withstand whatev come my wai __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but your campaign is sai that senat obama will wither under thi republican attack machin __PUNCT__
what argument will thei make __PUNCT__ why will he be __PUNCT__ why will he wither under that attack __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we had __PUNCT__ by most standard __PUNCT__ a veri cordial and civil campaign __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i know peopl look at thi campaign and sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ somebodi said thi and somebodi said that __PUNCT__ but by all account __PUNCT__ there haven't been the kind of attack ad that you go to see in the gener elect __PUNCT__
there haven't been the ten of million of dollar spent against either of us that will definit come our wai __PUNCT__
i do have some republican who ar alreadi work against me __PUNCT__
there some gentleman in texa __PUNCT__ who seem quit determin to run robo __PUNCT__ call and the like __PUNCT__ but peopl brush that off __PUNCT__
so we had a campaign that ha been an incred experi person for me and i think for all of the candid __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ truli __PUNCT__ whoever is our nomine will be make histori by the veri fact of becom the nomine __PUNCT__
but i think that when the hard work start __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ gener elect ar much more contest __PUNCT__
the other side ha no compunct about rais ani issu against whomev thei run against __PUNCT__ and we haven't seen that test and vet experi in thi primari __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ in hi prior elect in illinoi __PUNCT__ senat obama didn't face anyon who ran attack ad against him __PUNCT__
he ran against a veri weak oppon __PUNCT__ without resourc or credibl __PUNCT__
so i believ that thi will be a veri tough fought gener elect __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ senat obama agre with you that the democrat ha to provid a clear contrast with senat mccain on nation secur __PUNCT__
here how he put it the other dai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin audio clip __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the wai to win a debat with john mccain or ani republican who nomin is not by have the democrat nomin someon who agre with him on vote for the war in iraq __PUNCT__ who agre with him in vote to give georg bush the benefit of the doubt on iran __PUNCT__ who agre with him in embrac the bush __PUNCT__ chenei polici of not talk to leader we don't like __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end audio clip __PUNCT__ stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ he sai he provid the contrast you can't __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think elect ar about the futur __PUNCT__ and what voter ar go to be think about is who can best get us out of iraq __PUNCT__ who can do it in the most respons and care wai __PUNCT__ who will have the credibl __PUNCT__ the strength and the experi to convei to the rest of the world that we ar undo thi disastr polici __PUNCT__ but you better not in ani wai doubt america resolv to protect and defend ourselv here at home and around the world __PUNCT__
and i think the contrast between me and senat mccain could not be stronger __PUNCT__
he want to be there for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
it would be fine with him __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ if i don't start get our troop outwithin __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ you be surpris __PUNCT__ becaus that what i intend to do __PUNCT__
so get them out within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ begin that process __PUNCT__ ok to stai __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i think voter will see a veri stark contrast __PUNCT__
and i want to sai someth els __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ senat obama consist misstat what i had said and realli tri to gloss over hi answer to a question in an earli debat __PUNCT__
the question wa veri specif __PUNCT__ would you __PUNCT__ without precondit __PUNCT__ meet with five of the worst dictat __PUNCT__ includ ahmadinejad from iran and other __PUNCT__ without precondit __PUNCT__ person __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ he said ye __PUNCT__
i said no __PUNCT__
that ha noth to do with whether or not we would havediplomat effort with all of the countri __PUNCT__
i been a longtim advoc of have diplomat process with iran and syria __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so you open to direct contact with all those countri __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i think it imper __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you open to direct contact with __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ all those countri __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ with iran and syria __PUNCT__ most certainli __PUNCT__
i have said that __PUNCT__
but it would be at low level diplomat effort __PUNCT__ between our ambassador and between our diplomat __PUNCT__ becaus i don't think a presid should put the prestig of the unit state on the line to meet with these peopl unless you have some idea of what is go to happen __PUNCT__
and i alwai a littl amus when senat obama goe around quot presid kennedi __PUNCT__ when he wa run for the presid __PUNCT__ about how you should never be afraid to negoti __PUNCT__
but then if you look at the actual transcript of what presid kennedi said in the debat with vice presid nixon __PUNCT__ he said he would not meet with khrushchev unless there had been a lot of groundwork laid __PUNCT__
that is the appropri posit for the presid of the unitedst to take __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ i realli hope that senat obama will quit deliber misstat what i said in order to avoid scrutini for what he sai __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ let look at health care __PUNCT__ anoth contrastbetween you and senat obama __PUNCT__
he been press that case thi weekend __PUNCT__
the kei differ __PUNCT__ as you point out __PUNCT__ is you would requir everyon to have health insur __PUNCT__
you believ that will get to univers coverag __PUNCT__
he would not __PUNCT__
here what senat obama said about that in the debat __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin audio clip __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ you can mandat it __PUNCT__ but there still go to be peopl who can't afford it __PUNCT__
and if thei cannot afford it __PUNCT__ then the question is what ar you go to do about it __PUNCT__ ar you go to fine them __PUNCT__ ar you go to garnish their wage __PUNCT__ end audio clip __PUNCT__ stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you didn't get the chanc to answer that question in the debat __PUNCT__
what is the answer to those two question __PUNCT__ will you have fine for peopl who don't bui health care __PUNCT__ don't appli __PUNCT__ don't go by the mandat __PUNCT__ will you garnish their wage __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__ let put thi in context __PUNCT__ becaus thi is a big differ between us __PUNCT__
i think univers health care is a core democrat valu and a moral principl __PUNCT__ and i absolut go to doeveryth i can to achiev that __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ if you look at my plan __PUNCT__ it a misstat to sai that peopl won't be abl to afford it __PUNCT__ becaus i have a veri detail approach about give peopl health care tax credits,limit __PUNCT__ i the onli person who doe __PUNCT__ limit the percentag of what you would have to pai for a premium to a low percent of yourincom __PUNCT__
thi plan ha been examin by independ expert __PUNCT__ and thei agre with me __PUNCT__ just as thei agre with senat edward __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__ that if you do not start with a plan that attempt to achiev univers health care __PUNCT__ you will not get there __PUNCT__
the insur compani will continu to cherri __PUNCT__ pick __PUNCT__
the emerg room will be crowd __PUNCT__
and onc again __PUNCT__ we will slide into the morass we in now __PUNCT__ where more and more peopl ar uninsur and we don't get the qualiti outcom that we should __PUNCT__
with respect to how do you get peopl to do it __PUNCT__ i find thi somewhat bewild __PUNCT__
senat obama ha a mandat __PUNCT__
he ha a mandat on children __PUNCT__
he ha talk a lot about requir peopl __PUNCT__ if thei show up to get some kind of health care __PUNCT__ like in the emerg room __PUNCT__ and thei don't have health insur __PUNCT__ hit them right then to make sure that thei get some kind of health insur __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think you should wait until someon in distress or sick __PUNCT__
i think you should look to sign peopl up when thei come into contact with the health __PUNCT__ care system or govern agenc __PUNCT__
about __NUM__ percent of the peopl who don't have health insur in america todai could well afford it __PUNCT__ even at the cost that it is __PUNCT__ which is exorbit __PUNCT__
so what we got to do is have share respons __PUNCT__
everybodi ha to pai someth __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ on a slide scale __PUNCT__
that why my health care tax credit __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but let me interrupt you there __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ and the premium cap will work __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ let me interrupt you there __PUNCT__ becaus the other night at the debat __PUNCT__ you said that you and senat edward bit the bullet on thi question __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ of mandat __PUNCT__ and senat edward wa quit clear in hi plan __PUNCT__
he said if peopl still didn't bui the insur __PUNCT__ their wage would be garnish __PUNCT__
and i still haven't heard __PUNCT__ if peopl can afford it and thei don't bui the insur __PUNCT__ will their wage be garnish under your plan __PUNCT__ will thei have to pai fine __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei don't have to pai fine __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__
we want them to have insur __PUNCT__
we want it to be afford __PUNCT__
and what i have said is that there ar a number of wai of doingthat __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there not just on wai of get to that __PUNCT__
i think you can automat enrol peopl __PUNCT__ and you will then sai you got to be part of thi __PUNCT__
it what senat obama doe for children __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ he ha a mandat __PUNCT__ and he ha a mean of enforc it or at least it appear he doe __PUNCT__
and what i have learn over the last mani year is that i sure the congress ha some idea about thi __PUNCT__
but if you don't start with univers health care __PUNCT__ if you don't sai everybodi go to be in the system __PUNCT__ we never get there __PUNCT__
and if you look at some of the mislead mail that senat obama is send out around the countri __PUNCT__ honest to good __PUNCT__ it look like it wa written by the health __PUNCT__ insur compani __PUNCT__
it so reminisc of old __PUNCT__ harri and louis __PUNCT__ talk about how __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ the sky will fall if we try to have univers health care __PUNCT__
he plai right in to all of the argument against thi core valu of the democrat parti __PUNCT__
i will stand on the stage with john mccain and engag in that debat __PUNCT__
why would we want a nomine who leav peopl out __PUNCT__ and senat mccain will sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i got a plan and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ it leav peopl out __PUNCT__
so we even __PUNCT__
that is not the kind of contrast we should be draw go into thi gener elect __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ yet __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ we actual have that mail and let me show our viewer quickli what you were talk about __PUNCT__ becaus you refer to it __PUNCT__
it sai that hillari plan will __PUNCT__ excus me __PUNCT__ let me read thi again __PUNCT__ forc everyon to bui insur __PUNCT__ even if you can't afford it __PUNCT__
you pai a penalti if you don't __PUNCT__
and i want to bear down on thi question on more time __PUNCT__ becaus thei claim thi issu of the penalti __PUNCT__
and a lot of independ health care expert __PUNCT__ mani who work with you in __NUM__ sai that without these enforc mechan __PUNCT__ you simpli can't get to univers coverag __PUNCT__ you can't claim to have univers coverag __PUNCT__ so there no differ between your plan and senat obama __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ you talk about automat enrol __PUNCT__
will you garnish wage of peopl who don't compli __PUNCT__ don't bui the insur __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__ we will have an enforc mechan __PUNCT__
whether it that or it some other mechan through the tax system or automat enrol __PUNCT__
but you miss __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ the kei point __PUNCT__
if you don't start with univers health care __PUNCT__ and i have veri aggress cost control and qualiti improv __PUNCT__ and my health care tax credit plu the premium cap that i am the onli person to put in to a health care plan to sai __PUNCT__ your incom will be adjust so that a small percentag will be alwai the limit of what you have to pai for premium __PUNCT__
if you don't do what i am sai we do __PUNCT__ we will never even attempt to get to univers health care __PUNCT__
and the reason why i think there ar a number of mechan __PUNCT__ go after peopl wage __PUNCT__ automat enrol __PUNCT__ when you ar at the place of employ __PUNCT__ you will be automat enrol __PUNCT__ whatev the mechan is is not as import as __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ the fundament commit to univers health care __PUNCT__ the appreci that __PUNCT__ with health care tax credit and with a premium cap __PUNCT__ it will be afford for everyon __PUNCT__
and the mislead inform that senat obama campaign is put out __PUNCT__ that i will forc peopl to do it even if thei can't afford it __PUNCT__ is absolut untru __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ there will be mechan to enabl everyon to afford it __PUNCT__
we have cost thi out __PUNCT__ and we will be abl to achiev it __PUNCT__
so isn't it better that we start with a system that get everybodi in than start with a plan that leav __NUM__ million peopl out to start __PUNCT__ which will onli get bigger and bigger as time goe on __PUNCT__ stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ anoth issu in the debat __PUNCT__ the other night __PUNCT__ wa thi issu of a driver licens for illeg immigr __PUNCT__
you now sai that you ar not for it __PUNCT__
senat obama is for it __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ yesterdai __PUNCT__ the largest spanish languag paper in the unit state __PUNCT__ in lo angel __PUNCT__ la opinion __PUNCT__ cite it when thei endors barack obama __PUNCT__
thei said __PUNCT__ we were disappoint with senat clinton calcul opposit to driver licens for the undocu __PUNCT__ which contrast markedli from the forc argument in support made by obama __PUNCT__
we understand that thi is an extrem controversi issu __PUNCT__ but we believ there is onli on right posit and it is that of the senat from illinoi __PUNCT__
ar you worri that thi is go to hurt you in the latino commun __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ becaus i think i have the right posit __PUNCT__
i think thi is a divers from what ha to be comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ it is not a fair statement __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i attempt to support my governor as he tri to do someth that is __PUNCT__ admittedli __PUNCT__ controversi __PUNCT__ but i said at the time it wa not someth that i support __PUNCT__
when that didn't work __PUNCT__ it wa veri clear that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ my posit ha been consist __PUNCT__
i don't think we should be give driver licens to peopl who ar not document __PUNCT__
you put so mani difficult obstacl in the wai here __PUNCT__
you go to ask peopl in motor vehicl depart to basic overlook the immigr law of america __PUNCT__
you go to ask peopl to turn a blind ey and accept thi form of identif __PUNCT__
i think that is not the right wai to go __PUNCT__
i believ we should be put as much pressur on comprehens immigr reform as possibl __PUNCT__
and my support in california and in new york and across the countri __PUNCT__ latino and other __PUNCT__ understand exactli why thi is the posit we should be take __PUNCT__
and i intend to push for comprehens immigr reform upon take offic as presid __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ we just about out of time __PUNCT__
what do you make of the fact that ann coulter sai she go to support you if john mccain get the republican nomin __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that thi will be an interest elect __PUNCT__ all the wai through __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__
you never know __PUNCT__ strang bedfellow and all of that __PUNCT__
but i honestli believ that it would be a tremend contest between senat mccain and myself __PUNCT__
i think i can draw the contrast and stand on that stage with him __PUNCT__
you know as well as i do that __PUNCT__ at the end of everi elect __PUNCT__ independ voter ar often drawn back to a fundament question __PUNCT__ who can protect and defend the unit state of america __PUNCT__ and although secur is not foremost on the agenda __PUNCT__ there is no predict what the agenda will look like come next fall __PUNCT__
and i believ that i am much better posit __PUNCT__ by record and experi __PUNCT__ by the valu and the opinion that i express in thi campaign __PUNCT__ to go on __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ on with john mccain __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ at some point __PUNCT__ i happi to have ani voter __PUNCT__ although thi on took me somewhat by surpris __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ thank veri much for your time thi morn __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ good to talk to you __PUNCT__
