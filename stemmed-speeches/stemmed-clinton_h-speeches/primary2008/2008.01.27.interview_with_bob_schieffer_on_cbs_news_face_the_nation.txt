senat clinton __PUNCT__ thank you for join us __PUNCT__
thei often sai we __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ my pleasur __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ __URL__ more from our loss than we do from our victori __PUNCT__
you took a real drub last night in south carolina __PUNCT__
what did you learn __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__ i congratul senat obama and thank the peopl of south carolina __PUNCT__ who realli welcom us all into their home and their commun __PUNCT__
and it is an ongo process __PUNCT__
we got a long wai to go __PUNCT__
we each now have won a primari and a caucu __PUNCT__
i also wa veri honor to win in michigan __PUNCT__
and we go on __PUNCT__
we got the state of the union on mondai night __PUNCT__
we have florida on tuesdai __PUNCT__ and i be in florida on tuesdai night __PUNCT__
and then we got the __NUM__ state spread from massachusett to california __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ as i have said so mani time __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ thi elect realli isn't about us as candid __PUNCT__
it is about what we go to do as a countri and the live of the peopl watch us and everyon els who is touch by whether or not the economi work and health care there and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ all of the big challeng and opportun we face __PUNCT__
and i am particularli focus on do what i can to try to get presid bush to be much more vigor in respond to our econom challeng __PUNCT__
from what i heard and watch now __PUNCT__ it doesn't seem as though he realli get it __PUNCT__
and the state of the union is realli about the state of american __PUNCT__ live __PUNCT__
it about whether or not we go to be abl to avoid a deep and long recess and get ourselv back on track __PUNCT__ and that why i been push for __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ solut like put a mortgag moratorium on so that peopl don't lose their home for __NUM__ dai while we try to work it out to let them stai in their home __PUNCT__ and freez these interest rate befor thei realli go even higher and put so mani more peopl at risk __PUNCT__
and i obvious agre with do some tax rebat __PUNCT__ but i think in addit to that we got to take care of the peopl who ar lose their job __PUNCT__ with more unemploy __PUNCT__
we mai have to look at food stamp for peopl who ar fall out of the middl class __PUNCT__
and i think we could do a great deal to get our economi on the right track with green collar job and i like to see us invest in that __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ you know bob __PUNCT__ i wake up everi morn and i think about what i go to do todai __PUNCT__ what kind of a differ i go to make in peopl live __PUNCT__ and that what i am here in memphi do __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
you hardli mention last night when you __PUNCT__ when you got to nashvil __PUNCT__ what had happen in south carolina __PUNCT__
senat obama __PUNCT__ and perhap that understand __PUNCT__ becaus he won __PUNCT__ he made quit a big deal of it __PUNCT__
and on of the thing he said __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ wa he suggest that you and your husband ar exampl of the kind of partisanship that ha to stop __PUNCT__
i want you to listen to what he said __PUNCT__
senat barack obama __PUNCT__ it the kind of partisanship where you not even allow to sai that a republican had an idea __PUNCT__ even if it on you never agre with __PUNCT__
that the kind of polit that is bad for our parti __PUNCT__ it is bad for our countri __PUNCT__ and thi is our chanc to end it onc and for all __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ what your reaction to that __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ of cours i believ veri strongli in find common ground __PUNCT__
that what i done in the senat __PUNCT__
but i also believ in stand our ground against some of the veri poorli thought out and ill __PUNCT__ conceiv polici and idea that we had to fight against for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i don't see a contradict there __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the fight of the 1990 over try to get univers health care and eventu get a bipartisan children health insur program that i wa proud to work on __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that part of what you have to do in order to both find common ground and stand our ground __PUNCT__
i want __PUNCT__ more than anyon __PUNCT__ to bring our countri togeth and to unifi us __PUNCT__
but to me __PUNCT__ it is about work on meet the big challeng that we face __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when i look at univers health care __PUNCT__ that a core valu for me __PUNCT__
i not go to leav peopl out __PUNCT__ i go to go and do everyth i can to try to make the case that it is time for america to cover everi singl on of us with qualiti afford health care __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ when i take on the oil compani __PUNCT__ i go to take on the oil compani over a new energi futur __PUNCT__
so ye __PUNCT__ we do need to be bipartisan __PUNCT__ but we also need to get thing done for our countri __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ i think he wa not talk about argu with republican __PUNCT__ he wa talk about the attack that you had launch on him dure the campaign __PUNCT__
he suggest that you had taken hi word out of context __PUNCT__ and that that wa the kind of partisan in __PUNCT__ fight that is realli stop the kind of progress that ar go on __PUNCT__
and he wa talk about the tactic of the __PUNCT__ of the clinton campaign team in south carolina __PUNCT__ it seem to me __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that not how i heard it __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
but if that were the case __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we all have to compar and contrast our record __PUNCT__
that legitim __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the idea that somehow someon record __PUNCT__ someon word ar off __PUNCT__ limit __PUNCT__ i never __PUNCT__ i never seen that in american polit __PUNCT__ to be __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ reflect of my experi __PUNCT__
and i think it import that we draw these contrast __PUNCT__
you have to look at exactli what wa said __PUNCT__ but that up to the comment __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__ hmm __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ what i focus on is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ now we move forward __PUNCT__
we have these __NUM__ state ahead of us __PUNCT__
i alwai said that that where we would be at the end of these earli state __PUNCT__
i veri proud and humbl to be in thi posit __PUNCT__ compet for our parti nomin __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you see __PUNCT__ i do think that it is part of a voter right to know how we respond to what on anoth ha done and said __PUNCT__ and i think that part of a __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ vigor elect __PUNCT__
but at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ we will come togeth as democrat __PUNCT__
we will be a unit and commit parti to take back the white hous in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ let me just tell you what congressman clyburn __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ is a veri influenti african __PUNCT__ american congressman in south carolina __PUNCT__ he said last night that __PUNCT__ and he is neutral __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ he said that he hope the result in south carolina could chang the tenor of the rest of thi campaign __PUNCT__
do you agre with him __PUNCT__ or do you think he ha a point there __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
