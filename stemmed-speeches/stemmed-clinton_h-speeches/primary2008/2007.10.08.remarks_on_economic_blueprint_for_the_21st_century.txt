there ar million of famili like them struggl and come up short in an economi that just doesn't work for middl class american ani longer __PUNCT__
todai i would like to outlin sever of the challeng that thi economi and our peopl face __PUNCT__ global __PUNCT__ rise incom inequ __PUNCT__ the grow hous crisi __PUNCT__ all at a time of unpreced fiscal irrespons in washington __PUNCT__
thi administr ha fail to respond to these challeng and in fact __PUNCT__ mani of their polici have made thing wors __PUNCT__
i will chart a new cours as presid __PUNCT__
we have to chang our econom cours just as we have to chang cours in iraq __PUNCT__ and chang cours when it come to health care __PUNCT__
when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ i believ i have the strength and experi to make that chang __PUNCT__ and to make our economi work again for middl class american __PUNCT__ and for all american __PUNCT__
becaus in thi new global economi __PUNCT__ what have we seen __PUNCT__ we seen some job ship oversea __PUNCT__ and other replac with machin __PUNCT__
in thi decad the job that had been creat pai __NUM__ __PUNCT__ less than the job we lost __PUNCT__
it an economi that doesn't even creat mani new job __PUNCT__
job growth __PUNCT__ sinc __NUM__ under presid bush __PUNCT__ ha been the weakest of ani econom recoveri sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
it an economi that demand more from our worker and give less in return __PUNCT__
over the past six year __PUNCT__ worker product __PUNCT__ that mean how hard you work __PUNCT__ how much you put out per hour of your work __PUNCT__
product ha risen __NUM__ __PUNCT__ american worker ar the hardest work peopl in the world __PUNCT__
and yet just look around __PUNCT__ wage have stai flat __PUNCT__
corpor profit ar at a forti year high but the averag famili incom in america ha fallen by nearli __MONEY__
incom that is sore miss as colleg cost have risen __NUM__ __PUNCT__ health care premium have doubl __PUNCT__ and ga price have more than doubl __PUNCT__
accord to a recent report __PUNCT__ over the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ month period that end in __DATE__ of last year __PUNCT__ the slow growth in wage for labor account for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the increas in corpor profit __PUNCT__
so in other word __PUNCT__ compani ar actual profit off of their worker stagnant wage __PUNCT__
that is not the wai it us to be __PUNCT__
it us to be that when corpor profit went up __PUNCT__ worker wage went up __PUNCT__
but the current group of corpor leadership is not share the benefit of that increas profit with the worker who make the profit possibl __PUNCT__
it an economi where the gap between the few at the top and everybodi els just keep get wider __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ all incom gain went to the top __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of household __PUNCT__
while __PUNCT__ the bottom __NUM__ __PUNCT__ saw their incom declin __PUNCT__
and the wealthiest __NUM__ __PUNCT__ held __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of america incom __PUNCT__
now it us to be less than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thirti year ago __PUNCT__
thi is the highest level of incom inequ sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
hardli a red letter year for america __PUNCT__
and six and a half year of fiscal irrespons hasn't help matter __PUNCT__
between the presid reckless tax break to those at the top and a war that is cost __MONEY__ a dai __PUNCT__ we have run up record debt and we ar now at __MONEY__ trillion and count __PUNCT__
now up until recent __PUNCT__ at least hous price were rise __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ between __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so while hard work famili were get squeez from everi direct __PUNCT__ and their credit card were often max out __PUNCT__ thei us their home as a safeti net __PUNCT__
when the bill got too high __PUNCT__ thei could dip in to their home equiti to pai them __PUNCT__
then hous price start to fall __PUNCT__ and suddenli the safeti net shrunk __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ famili who financ their home with non __PUNCT__ tradit high risk loan saw their mortgag rate jump __PUNCT__
now mani famili final stuck with mortgag thei can't pai and expens thei can't afford __PUNCT__
the result is __NUM__ million foreclosur so far thi year __PUNCT__
file in __DATE__ alon were up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ in iowa __PUNCT__ and home price ar expect to declin thi year __PUNCT__ the first annual nation __PUNCT__ wide drop sinc hous agenc began keep record in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
alex pollick __PUNCT__ the former ceo of the feder home loan bank of chicago __PUNCT__ recent testifi befor congress and said that the problem in the hous market could cost america __MONEY__ trillion in household wealth __PUNCT__
and while we all hope that the hous market woe remain contain __PUNCT__ expert worri that the price in the hous market could spread throughout the economi __PUNCT__
we alreadi see some earli warn sign __PUNCT__
consum confid ha weaken __PUNCT__
the pace of employ growth ha slow even more sinc the begin of thi year __PUNCT__
automak ar record that the hous price is hurt auto sale and big invest bank ar write off billion in invest and start layoff ti to the hous industri __PUNCT__
so taken togeth __PUNCT__ the pressur of stagnant wage __PUNCT__ rise health __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and energi cost __PUNCT__ increas household debt __PUNCT__ and a soften hous market ar creat a trap door economi __PUNCT__
too mani famili ar stand on that trap door __PUNCT__ just on diagnosi __PUNCT__ on pink slip __PUNCT__ on miss mortgag payment awai from fall through and lose everyth thei work for __PUNCT__
thei bear all of the risk of the global economi but reap few of the reward __PUNCT__
so i hear all over as i travel throughout iowa and america __PUNCT__ peopl ask me __PUNCT__ peopl ask themselv __PUNCT__ what am i go to do __PUNCT__ and i think it fair to ask our leader __PUNCT__ what ar you go to do __PUNCT__ well for six and a half year we seen thi administr answer __PUNCT__ their answer to job be outsourc __PUNCT__ continu tax incent to compani that outsourc job to tax haven __PUNCT__
their answer to rise inequ __PUNCT__ tax break for the wealthi that actual increas inequ __PUNCT__
their answer to __NUM__ million american without health care __PUNCT__ veto health care for five million children from work famili __PUNCT__
their answer to rise insecur __PUNCT__ shift even more risk onto the individu by try to privat social secur __PUNCT__
their answer to stagnant wage and anem job growth __PUNCT__ a war on scienc that ha slow the critic research we need to creat the high __PUNCT__ wage job of the futur __PUNCT__
their econom philosophi boil down to thi __PUNCT__ in the new global economi __PUNCT__ accord to the republican __PUNCT__ america can't win unless most american lose __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__
that basic what thei tell us __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ just go along with it __PUNCT__
some folk ar do realli well __PUNCT__ that what we think it take to compet and win __PUNCT__
and everybodi els __PUNCT__ we sorri but we just can't help you __PUNCT__
now middl class famili alwai end up draw the short straw __PUNCT__
growth __PUNCT__ accord to thi republican philosophi __PUNCT__ ha to be unequ and govern can't help __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ the bush administr give no __PUNCT__ bid contract to polit alli __PUNCT__ allow no competit for senior citizen __PUNCT__ drug price under medicar __PUNCT__ and assum no account for outsourc nation secur respons to contractor like blackwat __PUNCT__
thei won't spend monei to help work famili get health insur for their kid __PUNCT__ but think noth of give health care provid billion more to take medicar patient off the roll __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ my econom philosophi is exactli the opposit __PUNCT__
it what i learn grow up in a middl class famili in the middl of america __PUNCT__
my father came back from world war ii after have serv in the navi __PUNCT__ and he work hard to build up hi small busi __PUNCT__
he believ you should avoid be in debt at all cost and instil in me the import of be respons with a budget at an earli ag __PUNCT__
it a valu i still hold dear todai __PUNCT__
but it that determin that i saw in my own famili that i see across thi state and across our countri __PUNCT__ that work ethic that ha creat the great american middl class __PUNCT__
i believ the middl class is the backbon of our economi __PUNCT__ the kei to real growth __PUNCT__ and the guarantor of the american dream __PUNCT__
and to paraphras an old sai __PUNCT__ as america middl class goe __PUNCT__ so goe america __PUNCT__
and so i judg the health of our economi veri differ than the wai thi white hous judg it __PUNCT__
i ask whether our middl class is expand and get ahead __PUNCT__
ar we on the road to a stronger __PUNCT__ more prosper middl class or not __PUNCT__ the administr ha fail that test __PUNCT__
my administr will not __PUNCT__
we will get back to make it clear that we will have polici that support the american middl class and that will be our goal __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ you can go back in american histori and see it work __PUNCT__
throughout our histori __PUNCT__ whenev we made strateg invest in our peopl and our futur __PUNCT__ the american economi ha creat unpreced prosper __PUNCT__
it ha spur scientist to make new discoveri __PUNCT__ entrepreneur to launch new industri __PUNCT__
it gener countless rag to rich stori and produc more millionair and billionair than anywher els on earth __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ it ha sustain the world largest __PUNCT__ strongest middl class and given poor peopl the chanc to work their wai into the middl class __PUNCT__ and left each gener more prosper than the on befor __PUNCT__
the strength of our economi and the rise of the middl class were product of both a free market and good public polici __PUNCT__ includ sound econom stewardship by presid from both parti __PUNCT__
think about teddi roosevelt bust the trust and root out corrupt __PUNCT__
franklin roosevelt build the infrastructur that drove thi centuri economi __PUNCT__
presid truman ensur that american gi had the tool thei need to seiz the promis of a great and grow futur __PUNCT__
presid eisenhow support more scienc and math educ __PUNCT__
presid kennedi set our sight on the moon and presid johnson work to end poverti and the insecur that come as we grow older __PUNCT__
in the 1990 __PUNCT__ my husband continu thi tradit __PUNCT__ combin fiscal respons with smart invest in our peopl __PUNCT__
and we did have pai __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ go rule that help to rein in spend __PUNCT__
and look at the result __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ million new job and the longest econom expans in american histori __PUNCT__
balanc budget and record surplus __PUNCT__
rise famili incom __PUNCT__ record level of home and busi ownership __PUNCT__ and on hundr time as mani peopl lift out of poverti than dure the reagan administr __PUNCT__
the secret to america past econom success is clear __PUNCT__
whenev the economi chang __PUNCT__ we chang with it and we master it __PUNCT__
we innov __PUNCT__
we invest __PUNCT__
we manag downturn and overcam them __PUNCT__
and we gener wealth and we made sure that wealth wa wide share __PUNCT__
well in the 1990 we were on our wai to creat good job __PUNCT__ with share prosper and the prospect of be debt free and have the resourc to fund the retir cost of the babi boom gener __PUNCT__
then we came to georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ it a sad stori __PUNCT__
presid bush __PUNCT__ with a republican congress that enabl him to fulli implement the trickl down econom thei been advoc for a gener __PUNCT__ ignor a centuri worth of wisdom __PUNCT__
in thi decad __PUNCT__ no american wa too wealthi to be deni big tax cut __PUNCT__
no well __PUNCT__ connect compani too prosper to lose it tax subsidi or protect from competit for govern monei __PUNCT__
meanwhil america middl class famili have been invis to the presid __PUNCT__
it as if he look right through them __PUNCT__
as colleg got more expens __PUNCT__ thei cut back on colleg aid __PUNCT__
so if you a young person who can't afford tuition __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
as health care got more expens __PUNCT__ thei tri to reduc coverag for children __PUNCT__
so if you on of the __NUM__ million american without health insur __PUNCT__ you invis as well __PUNCT__
as job got scarc and paid less __PUNCT__ thei tri to weaken union and stop enforc our trade law __PUNCT__
so if you a worker who can't organ for fair wage and safe work condit __PUNCT__ you invis too __PUNCT__
and as ga price explod __PUNCT__ thei allow us to becom more depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
so if you pai through the roof everi time you fill up your tank __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
well you not invis to me __PUNCT__
and when we take back the white hous __PUNCT__ you will no longer be invis to the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
becaus i do see you and i do hear you __PUNCT__
i see famili work as hard as thei can __PUNCT__
i see young peopl eager for opportun __PUNCT__
i see worker fight for their basic right __PUNCT__
and i will fight for you everi singl dai of my presid __PUNCT__
becaus as presid __PUNCT__ i want to bring a new begin to the __NUM__ centuri and build a new road to middl class prosper __PUNCT__
that is in my view the job of the next presid __PUNCT__ to restor broad econom prosper __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and secur __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but i know it can be done __PUNCT__
i saw that for myself in the eight year in the white hous as my husband carri out on of the most dramat econom turnaround in america histori __PUNCT__
and for nearli seven year __PUNCT__ as a senat from new york i have been work to build on that commit __PUNCT__ to support good econom polici __PUNCT__ resist bad on __PUNCT__ and help __PUNCT__ work with local peopl __PUNCT__ to bring econom opportun to depress region of my state __PUNCT__
todai i propos a new econom blueprint for the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri economi __PUNCT__ a plan to creat the new __PUNCT__ good job essenti to broad __PUNCT__ base prosper __PUNCT__ to restor fair to our economi __PUNCT__ and to renew that basic bargain that if you work hard you can get ahead and we will put our fiscal hous in order __PUNCT__
the first compon of my plan is to creat million of new job through an all out commit to a clean __PUNCT__ effici __PUNCT__ independ energi futur and to end thi administr assault on scienc so that innov can onc again be the engin of our econom growth __PUNCT__
for six and a half year __PUNCT__ thi administr first deni the realiti of our depend on foreign oil and then deni the realiti of climat chang and refus to make a seriou effort to deal with either __PUNCT__
it is heartbreak to know we ar more depend on foreign oil todai than we were befor 9/11 __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ but thi on the part of the presid wa just a small piec of a larger war on scienc and innov __PUNCT__ from muzzl and overrul scientist __PUNCT__ to suppress and manipul scientif evid __PUNCT__ to deni fund for stem cell research __PUNCT__
to paraphras stephen colbert __PUNCT__ thi administr doesn't make decis base on fact __PUNCT__
it make fact base on decis __PUNCT__
and as a result __PUNCT__ our competitor around the world ar get an edg on us in the global economi __PUNCT__
i want to restor america to it right place as the innov nation __PUNCT__
new discoveri __PUNCT__ new invent ar kei to new job and prosper __PUNCT__
i start by issu an execut order to end the war on scienc and restor a climat of scientif integr and independ __PUNCT__
thi order will rescind presid bush ban on stem cell research and ensur that govern scientist __PUNCT__
i will also dramat increas invest in basic and appli research at the nation scienc foundat __PUNCT__ the nation institut of health __PUNCT__ our univers __PUNCT__ and so mani other entiti that will take advantag of the tax credit for research and experiment __PUNCT__
and i want to invest in the idea __PUNCT__ leader of tomorrow by improv math and scienc educ __PUNCT__ expand fellowship for graduat studi __PUNCT__ and encourag more women and minor to choos career in scienc and engin __PUNCT__
to jumpstart our invest in altern energi __PUNCT__ i will establish a __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund to develop clean energi technolog like biomass and bio __PUNCT__ fuel grown right here in iowa to combat global warm and end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
we pai for the strateg energi fund by elimin the tax subsidi for the big oil compani and requir them to pai into the fund __PUNCT__
i would give them an option __PUNCT__ if thei ar will to invest in altern __PUNCT__ clean __PUNCT__ green technolog themselv then thei won't have to pai into the fund __PUNCT__ thei won't get the tax subsidi becaus there is no reason for us to be subsid them __PUNCT__
our oil compani have made record profit on the energi system that ha reduc our incom __PUNCT__ acceler climat chang __PUNCT__ and undermin our nation secur __PUNCT__
it time from them final to do their part to build a new energi economi that benefit all american and secur our children futur __PUNCT__
we ar see what the futur could be right here in iowa __PUNCT__
you lead the wai on har the power of altern energi to creat good new job __PUNCT__
a few month back i visit with some young men in crawfordsvil __PUNCT__
thei had grown up on farm and thei left home to go to school and thei were work elsewher around the countri __PUNCT__
thei start talk about mayb thei could actual go home __PUNCT__ us what thei learn grow up on a farm and make biodiesel fuel and that what thei did __PUNCT__
thei start a small busi and now thei have __NUM__ employe and a __NUM__ million gallon capac __PUNCT__
countri around the world ar move much faster than we ar __PUNCT__
employ for exampl in germani in the renew sector ha risen by __NUM__ percent in the past two year to __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
thei expect to creat more than __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
there no reason we can't do the same here in america __PUNCT__
i will also har the power of innov to rebuild our crumbl infrastructur __PUNCT__
thi is a problem that if we don't deal with it we go to be slow our econom growth __PUNCT__
economist estim that everi __MONEY__ billion spent on fix crumbl infrastructur creat nearli __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
my rebuild america plan invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year in an __PUNCT__ emerg repair fund __PUNCT__ to begin address the extens backlog of emerg repair need in our countri __PUNCT__
we need to modern our road __PUNCT__ our rail system __PUNCT__ our seaport __PUNCT__ our public transit system __PUNCT__ and to expand broadband access across america __PUNCT__
i also propos a __MONEY__ billion per year __PUNCT__ green build fund __PUNCT__ to build and renov public build and make them green and energi effici and the mayor is applaud and i know he understand it __PUNCT__
i believ we can innov our wai to __NUM__ centuri manufactur __PUNCT__
now i know there ar peopl in america who sai we can't be a manufactur economi ani longer and i don't believ that __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ i don't want to believ it becaus i think that a countri that doesn't make thing is a countri that is on a slow slide to incom inequ and a rogu economi __PUNCT__
but i also believ we have opportun here that we need to take advantag of __PUNCT__
i proud to be the co __PUNCT__ chair of the senat manufactur caucu __PUNCT__
it bipartisan __PUNCT__ we work to come up with idea that the bush administr wouldn't implement but i would as presid becaus i want to incentiv manufactur in america __PUNCT__
and thi is just the begin __PUNCT__
later thi week __PUNCT__ i be outlin an addit set of innov initi __PUNCT__ build on propos that i been make through thi campaign as well as some new on __PUNCT__
but in addit to creat new job with rise incom to be global competit __PUNCT__ we got to do more to restor fair to our economi __PUNCT__ to empow our worker and ensur that all american get their fair share __PUNCT__
that start with stand up for our union so that thei can stand up for our worker __PUNCT__
union worker make __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more monei than worker who aren't in union __PUNCT__
i want to put that up in a great big billboard becaus a lot of peopl don't know that the differ is that dramat __PUNCT__
but todai just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our privat sector workplac is union __PUNCT__
million of other peopl whose job ar not cover ar much more vulner to unsaf work condit __PUNCT__ be depriv of benefit __PUNCT__ not get their fair share when it come to the incom thei receiv for the job thei do __PUNCT__
if more peopl in america earn higher incom with better benefit __PUNCT__ their consum spend would increas and that would benefit the entir economi __PUNCT__
thi should not be a zero sum game where we have winner at the top and loser down the incom scale __PUNCT__
we need to get back to a win win strategi where we try to empow american not onli to have a better life for themselv and their famili but to be greater contributor to our overal prosper __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will fight to pass the employe free choic act so union can organ for fair wage and safe work condit __PUNCT__
you know it us to be in america when the middl class wa stronger it wa a lot easier to sign up to join a union __PUNCT__
and the reason thi is such an import issu __PUNCT__ even if you not in a union __PUNCT__ mayb you don't understand why thi is such a big deal __PUNCT__ why peopl stood up and applaud __PUNCT__ is that back when we had a strong middl class that wa realli grow and peopl were get a standard of live that their parent and grandpar would not have dream of __PUNCT__ it wa a lot easier __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ with republican presid and republican congress __PUNCT__ it becom so hard and there is harass and there is intimid and the employ realli just push peopl so that thei don't feel that a union is in their interest __PUNCT__
i want peopl to make up their own mind __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ it a free countri __PUNCT__
if you can decid to join a civic organ you should be abl to decid to join a union without fear of coercion and if you don't want to decid to join on __PUNCT__ well that your choic as well __PUNCT__
unlik the current presid __PUNCT__ i will actual appoint peopl to the depart of labor and the nation labor relat board who ar pro __PUNCT__ labor and care about work peopl __PUNCT__
and i will work from dai on to ensur that our trade polici actual work for american worker __PUNCT__
that thei includ strong enforc protect for labor and environment standard __PUNCT__ and that thei deliv benefit not just for trade partner __PUNCT__ not just for the peopl at the top of the incom scale in america __PUNCT__ but for all american __PUNCT__
becaus look at what ha happen in the past six year __PUNCT__
our trade deficit ha doubl in just six year to __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
the econom polici institut estim that we lost __NUM__ million job to china __PUNCT__ we pai higher price for low cost consum good some of which have seriou safeti problem __PUNCT__
now the last __NUM__ year mai have been great for china __PUNCT__ but is it the best cours for america go forward __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__
it time for a new approach __PUNCT__ on that doesn't lead to a race to the bottom __PUNCT__ but instead ensur that ordinari citizen not ceo but peopl who do the work in america and in other nation come out ahead again __PUNCT__
i will start by appoint a trade enforc offic within the unit state trade repres offic who will be respons for vigor enforc trade agreement __PUNCT__
and i will doubl the size of the enforc unit __PUNCT__
the bush administr ha file roughli the same number of enforc action under our trade agreement that were file dure on year of the clinton administr __PUNCT__
that is unaccept __PUNCT__
thei abdic their respons __PUNCT__ no on should get awai with violat trade agreement __PUNCT__ and when i presid __PUNCT__ we go to start enforc them again and we not go to enter into them unless we think thei go to be good for american worker __PUNCT__
next i will work to address specif problem with nafta __PUNCT__
as i said befor __PUNCT__ thi agreement ha some seriou shortcom __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ i did a studi last year in new york look at the impact of nafta on our busi peopl __PUNCT__ our worker and our farmer becaus we share a long boarder with canada __PUNCT__
but what peopl were tell me whom i repres is thei could not get their product into canada despit nafta promis of equal access __PUNCT__
and i did a studi and i sent it to the bush administr and i said i want answer as to why thi is not work __PUNCT__
you know i have appl farmer up along the boarder __PUNCT__ thei couldn't get their appl in but appl were come out of canada __PUNCT__
i had busi peopl who couldn't figur out how to get through all of the red tape to get their product in __PUNCT__ but product were come out of canada __PUNCT__
now we have a great relationship with canada __PUNCT__
but i think it is time that we assess trade agreement everi five year to make sure thei meet their goal or make adjust if thei ar not and we should start with do that with nafta __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i will overhaul our trade adjust assist program to ensur that worker who lost their job becaus of global competit get the incom support __PUNCT__ the health care __PUNCT__ the job train and the job placement assist thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
you know the trade adjust assist program is a lifelin for worker across america who can us it __PUNCT__
unfortun too few peopl can us it __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ servic worker whose job ar lost to outsourc should be abl to be elig to receiv taa benefit __PUNCT__
it make no sens to keep exclud servic worker becaus we know we lose a lot of servic job oversea __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ taa should cover all worker whose plant have move abroad whether or not the plant move to a countri with which we have a free trade agreement __PUNCT__
believ it or not __PUNCT__ trade adjust assist current doe not cover worker whose job ar outsourc to china and india becaus we don't have free trade agreement with them __PUNCT__
i want to doubl the fund for the job train program under taa to __MONEY__ million a year and increas taa tax credit to help displac worker pai for health insur __PUNCT__
now ultim under my american health choic plan __PUNCT__ worker will be abl to bui into the feder employe health benefit plan __PUNCT__ the same program that insur member of congress __PUNCT__
i will also work to restor fair to our tax system __PUNCT__
first i will return to the incom tax rate for upper __PUNCT__ incom american that we had in the 1990 __PUNCT__
those rate were consist with a balanc budget and econom growth __PUNCT__
and i will level the plai field when it come to tax on incom __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ wall street invest manag make __MONEY__ million a year pai just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ on their earn becaus thei classifi what thei do as ordinari incom __PUNCT__
as not ordinari incom __PUNCT__ but as capit gain __PUNCT__
when thei go to work everydai __PUNCT__ thei manag all thi monei __PUNCT__ but thei sai what thei do is an invest __PUNCT__ not manag __PUNCT__
well a teacher make __MONEY__ __NUM__ a year pai __NUM__ __PUNCT__
those who have been most richli reward by the modern economi should not pai lower tax rate on their incom than nurs or home health care worker or bu driver or machinist or anybodi els and we ar go to make sure that thei no longer do __PUNCT__
for middl class american __PUNCT__ i will extend the tax cut includ the child tax credit __PUNCT__ the marriag penalti relief __PUNCT__ and lower incom tax rate that thei current pai __PUNCT__
and i will reform someth call the altern minimum tax __PUNCT__ the amt __PUNCT__ to make sure it doesn't hit middl class famili with higher tax rate __PUNCT__
it wa never intend to do that __PUNCT__
i will also expand the earn incom tax credit to help famili that ar struggl to join the middl class __PUNCT__
and i will be provid tax credit to help small busi pai for health care __PUNCT__
i want to take a hard look at corpor tax reform as well __PUNCT__
it is simpli not right that as corpor profit have skyrocket __PUNCT__ the percentag of tax paid by corpor ha fallen __PUNCT__
we can fix that if we close the loophol __PUNCT__ end the unjustifi tax break __PUNCT__ and stop subsid the movement of job to foreign tax haven __PUNCT__
we go to get that done __PUNCT__
the third compon of my plan is to restor america basic bargain __PUNCT__ if you work hard you can get ahead becaus you have the tool and support you need to succe in the global economi __PUNCT__
that start with recommit ourselv to make colleg afford for young peopl __PUNCT__
you know i wa in new hampshir yesterdai morn and a young man stood up and ask a question __PUNCT__ he said he wa a high school senior __PUNCT__
he want to go to colleg __PUNCT__ he hope eventu he could even go to law school __PUNCT__
he said where am i go to get the financi help to do that __PUNCT__ he said i on of the top student in my class and i afraid i won't be abl to afford to do what i want to do to pursu my dream __PUNCT__
well on thursdai i will outlin my plan for make colleg afford __PUNCT__ includ modern the hope scholarship program that provid tax credit to help young peopl attend colleg __PUNCT__
we know that we got to improv the skill and educ of our workforc __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ and i have to confess i wa surpris __PUNCT__ i ask to find out the statist but even i wa surpris __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ of student at america best public and privat univers and colleg come from the top __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of incom in america __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
so that leav __NUM__ __PUNCT__ for everybodi els __PUNCT__
just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the student come from the bottom __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of incom __PUNCT__
it didn't us to be like thi __PUNCT__
we us to believ that if you work hard and you were colleg materi __PUNCT__ you would go to colleg __PUNCT__
we clearli need to make colleg access so that student from all differ background have the chanc to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
and for those who don't attend four __PUNCT__ year colleg __PUNCT__ and who need skill and train __PUNCT__ let provid more support for commun colleg and institut that help prepar them for good __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__
about a year and a half ago i had two meet within the space of on week __PUNCT__
i had a meet with the auto dealer from new york who came to see me and thei said __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ we have __NUM__ good job for auto mechan right now that we can't get fill becaus nobodi train auto mechan ani longer __PUNCT__
and the job is more complic becaus we all have these comput in our car __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ thei talk to us and tell us which wai to turn and all that __PUNCT__
and the auto dealer sai we don't know what to do so we go to start our own school becaus we don't know where we go get peopl to do thi import job __PUNCT__
shortli after that i had a visit from some of the member of the machinist union that i work with in new york __PUNCT__
thei told me thei were worri about the ag of the machinist on airplan __PUNCT__ the workforc is get older __PUNCT__ what were we go to do to have a pipelin with more young peopl __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ thi is a problem that we should begin to handl now __PUNCT__
we have a lot of decent hardwork young and not so young peopl who deserv to have a good job __PUNCT__
and i believ skill worker will be in a shortag in the futur __PUNCT__
so let start give them the tool thei need to be competit right now __PUNCT__
and of cours i outlin my health care plan to ensur that everi american ha qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the american health choic plan is realli simpl __PUNCT__
if you have insur you like __PUNCT__ you keep it __PUNCT__
if you don't have insur or don't like the insur you have __PUNCT__ you can choos from the same menu of privat plan avail to member of congress or you can opt into a new public plan that will be like medicar __PUNCT__
we provid those tax credit to make it afford and your coverag will be guarante even if you lose your job __PUNCT__ even if it is outsourc __PUNCT__
and if you decid to start your own busi or stai home with your children for a few year __PUNCT__ you will never be deni coverag becaus of pre __PUNCT__ exist condit or risk factor __PUNCT__
i believ we can save __MONEY__ billion a year in our health care system __PUNCT__
if we emphas prevent __PUNCT__ which we don't do now __PUNCT__ if we emphas chronic care manag __PUNCT__ which we don't do veri well now __PUNCT__ if we move toward electron medic record so we don't keep lose medic record and peopl ar told thei have to take the same test twice __PUNCT__ three time over and when you travel from iowa to see your famili in illinoi or florida you can have that record at your fingertip __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ there a lot we can do __PUNCT__
and that will also creat new job __PUNCT__
and final anoth compon of the basic bargain is homeownership __PUNCT__
year of progress on thi front ar threaten by the grow problem in the hous market and i think we have to address thi crisi immedi __PUNCT__
if home price keep fall __PUNCT__ mani famili will soon find themselv with mortgag larger than the valu of their home __PUNCT__
at that point __PUNCT__ thei won't be abl to refin __PUNCT__
so we don't have ani time to wast __PUNCT__
i alreadi announc a four __PUNCT__ part plan to address mortgag industri abus __PUNCT__
crack down on unscrupul broker __PUNCT__ curb unfair lend practic __PUNCT__ support state and commun initi that help famili avoid foreclosur __PUNCT__ and increas the suppli of afford hous in america again __PUNCT__
todai i announc three new propos __PUNCT__
the first is what i call the save our home program to rescu famili trap in unwork mortgag __PUNCT__
__MONEY__ billion dollar worth of adjust rate mortgag ar reset in __DATE__ and approxim __MONEY__ billion will reset everi month thereaft for the next year __PUNCT__
that mean hundr of thousand of american will see their mortgag rate jump and too mani will go into default __PUNCT__
the save our home program will enabl these two feder charter entiti __PUNCT__ fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ as well as state hous financ agenc __PUNCT__ to replac these unwork mortgag with stabl __PUNCT__ fix __PUNCT__ rate loan that famili can afford __PUNCT__
my second propos is the realiz the dream program to make more mortgag credit avail to respons homebuy now __PUNCT__
right now becaus of market condit __PUNCT__ mani bank ar reluct to write mortgag even for respons __PUNCT__ credit __PUNCT__ worthi buyer __PUNCT__
thei especi reluct to write mortgag larger than those that fanni mae and freddi mac can bui from them __PUNCT__
so my plan would temporarili increas the size of the mortgag that fanni and freddi __PUNCT__ as we call them in washington __PUNCT__ can purchas and that would encourag more bank to continu make loan to more american __PUNCT__
my third propos is a foreclosur rescu fraud act to crack down on the unscrupul consult __PUNCT__
i alreadi said let crack down on the unscrupul broker __PUNCT__
now we got a whole new field of unscrupul consult that ar knock on the door of peopl who ar at risk of lose their home __PUNCT__
thei claim to be abl to help homeown avoid foreclosur __PUNCT__
thei take hefti fee and thei disappear __PUNCT__
no actual assist __PUNCT__ spread the word __PUNCT__
anybodi you know __PUNCT__ don't listen to anybodi who call you on the phone or knock on your door and tell you thei got a great wai of save your home __PUNCT__
if it too good to be true __PUNCT__ it probabl isn't true __PUNCT__
so what i want to do is to creat a feder statut impos crimin penalti on these fraudul consult and allow victim to collect damag so that thei don't get even more victim __PUNCT__
as you know in america __PUNCT__ homeownership isn't just the kei to financi secur __PUNCT__ it about lai down root in your commun and build the life you want for you and your famili __PUNCT__
and i will make sure that the dream of homeownership is not lost __PUNCT__
and i will also protect retir secur __PUNCT__
we go to stand up for social secur and medicar __PUNCT__
i be outlin in more detail my plan to help american save __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ and build wealth for retir tomorrow becaus we know we got to tackl that as well __PUNCT__
and i don't think we can do all of thi unless we return america to fiscal respons __PUNCT__
and what we seen from thi presid is increas spend at more than doubl the rate of the previou administr __PUNCT__
anybodi who tell you that the republican ar the parti of fiscal respons __PUNCT__ just roll your ey becaus the fact could not be more differ __PUNCT__
how ha presid bush paid for these tax cut to multi __PUNCT__ millionair __PUNCT__ oil compani __PUNCT__ and other interest group __PUNCT__ how ha he paid for the war in iraq and the no __PUNCT__ bid contract and the tax cut that seem to have no end in sight __PUNCT__ i tell you how he done it __PUNCT__
he run record deficit and he borrow monei from foreign countri like china __PUNCT__
when he took offic we had those budget surplus and we were on track to be debt free in a few year __PUNCT__
now with a nation debt of __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ up nearli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ sinc presid bush took offic __PUNCT__ he left our children and our grandchildren to pai the bill __PUNCT__
did you know that everi babi born in america todai start life with __MONEY__ of nation debt on hi or her tini shoulder __PUNCT__ that is the largest birth tax in histori __PUNCT__
and trillion of it is ow to countri like china __PUNCT__ and japan __PUNCT__ and korea __PUNCT__ and middl east produc of oil __PUNCT__ we even ow monei to mexico __PUNCT__
put simpli __PUNCT__ we ar borrow monei from abroad to give tax cut to presid bush friend and special interest __PUNCT__
so when peopl ask me __PUNCT__ why is it so hard to get tough on china and other trade partner __PUNCT__ i tell them becaus thei been turn into our banker __PUNCT__
we ow them __PUNCT__
how can we truli enforc trade law against a countri like china whose manipul currenc put us at unfair disadvantag __PUNCT__ but our econom stabil depend on them continu to provid massiv loan to us everi singl month __PUNCT__ i want america back in control of our fiscal destini __PUNCT__
it mai take a few year but we have to move back toward a balanc budget and a surplu __PUNCT__
we have to find a wai both to increas long __PUNCT__ term invest and to stop borrow monei from other countri for current consumpt __PUNCT__ whether it for our soldier in the field or for tax cut for millionair __PUNCT__
we have to develop a set of budget rule similar to those we had in the 90 that requir us to fund new expenditur with new revenu or cut spend __PUNCT__
i think it go to be a challeng to do thi but i believ thi is the chang that america want __PUNCT__
if we do it right __PUNCT__ we will spark broadli share prosper even greater than the growth we enjoi in the 90 __PUNCT__
i look at the world we in now and ye i see a lot of threat __PUNCT__ a lot of challeng __PUNCT__ but i see tremend opportun __PUNCT__
seventi __PUNCT__ on year ago thi month dure a campaign stop in kansa citi __PUNCT__ missouri __PUNCT__ presid franklin roosevelt said __PUNCT__ to a greater degre than ani other peopl __PUNCT__ we have sought to give each rise gener a littl better chanc in life than the on that preced it __PUNCT__
he spoke also of our __PUNCT__ faith in the futur __PUNCT__ a faith under which america ha onli begun to march __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ it time for america to march again __PUNCT__ toward rebuild our middl class and restor our faith in the futur our children and grandchildren deserv __PUNCT__
it a forward march i want to lead and i hope you will give me the honor to do that __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
