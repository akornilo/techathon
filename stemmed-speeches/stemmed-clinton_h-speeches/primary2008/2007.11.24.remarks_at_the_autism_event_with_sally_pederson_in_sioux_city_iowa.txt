as lieuten governor she led the vilsack __PUNCT__ pederson administr initi for health care and human servic __PUNCT__ and she ha been an effect advoc for peopl with disabl __PUNCT__
her work with the homestead __PUNCT__ which serv adult live with autism __PUNCT__ is an exampl that i like to see replic across the countri __PUNCT__
she came to thi as most peopl who ar advoc do __PUNCT__ becaus of her own child __PUNCT__
and to the extent we address autism todai as part of the presidenti campaign __PUNCT__ it becaus of parent like salli who fought for their children when no on els would even acknowledg there wa a problem __PUNCT__
driven by their love and devot __PUNCT__ mother and father across the countri have rais awar __PUNCT__ demand fund __PUNCT__ and open our ey to the need of so mani children __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when i wa in law school __PUNCT__ i took a special year at the yale child studi center __PUNCT__
that wa back in the veri earli __NUM__ __PUNCT__
at that time __PUNCT__ scienc wa still blame parent for autism __PUNCT__
and thei particularli blame mother __PUNCT__
and i rememb read some of the so __PUNCT__ call research and in particular the work of on scientist who had a lot of nation and intern promin for hi theori __PUNCT__
and i thought __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that just can't be right __PUNCT__ there got to be more to it to that __PUNCT__
i later move to littl rock where on of my friend had a son with autism __PUNCT__
and i spent time in her home __PUNCT__ i spent time with her and her son and my instinct perhap as a mother wa that thi could not be the explan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ despit what scienc us to do __PUNCT__ blame the parent for autist kid __PUNCT__ now we know that parent ar the child best hope to deal with what is a veri complic set of condit __PUNCT__
i want to discuss thi issu todai becaus the recent increas in autism ar alarm __PUNCT__
the number of children with an autism spectrum disord __PUNCT__ that mean across the spectrum from what call asberg syndrom __PUNCT__ where kid with it mai be or adult with it mai be not as social interact as you or i would be but thei can function pretti well __PUNCT__ all the wai to the most sever form of autism includ seizur and mental retard __PUNCT__ all along thi spectrum there so mani differ symptom and differ capac that peopl have __PUNCT__
the number with the autism spectrum disord ha grown from __NUM__ in __NUM__ in __NUM__ to __NUM__ in __NUM__ in __NUM__ and the number continu to rise __PUNCT__
the autism societi of america estim that __NUM__ million american and their famili ar now affect by autism __PUNCT__
thei believ that could reach four million in the next decad __PUNCT__
autism affect peopl of all racial __PUNCT__ ethnic __PUNCT__ and social group __PUNCT__ although it is four time more like to strike boi than girl which is why the boi club tackl thi here in sioux citi is such a great contribut __PUNCT__
and autism is cost the unit state at least __NUM__ billion dollar a year __PUNCT__
the symptom have becom all too familiar __PUNCT__
the child who never make ey contact __PUNCT__ doesn't notic when hi dad come home after work __PUNCT__
the child who stack block over and over and over again __PUNCT__
the child who would rather twirl in a corner by herself than plai with other kid __PUNCT__
these children have so much to contribut __PUNCT__ but thei ar often trap insid their own world __PUNCT__ unabl to commun __PUNCT__
yet for all the peopl autism affect __PUNCT__ we don't know that much about what caus it and why it is increas in number __PUNCT__
we don't know how to cure it and we don't even know the best wai to treat it __PUNCT__
we don't have enough servic to care for those who have it or support their famili __PUNCT__
i think it time we had a govern and a presid that recogn the serious of autism and address it head __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__
i am commit to thi caus __PUNCT__ and as salli said i have been fight for children __PUNCT__ particularli children with need __PUNCT__ children with disabl __PUNCT__ children who ar abus or neglect __PUNCT__ children without adequ educ or health care for my entir adult life __PUNCT__
onc i went to work for the children defens fund __PUNCT__ my first assign wa to go door to door in new bedford __PUNCT__ massachusett and figur out why so mani children who were list in the censu figur weren't enrol in school __PUNCT__
i went door to door __PUNCT__ and home after home __PUNCT__ i found reason __PUNCT__ i found children who were blind or who were deaf __PUNCT__ children in wheelchair __PUNCT__ children with behavior problem __PUNCT__
thei were kept home becaus school wouldn't accommod them __PUNCT__
i knew then that i want to spend my life be a voic for children __PUNCT__ children who had been left behind and too often forgotten __PUNCT__
i want to fight to give all children the same opportun i had grow up __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ on of the most urgent __PUNCT__ and least understood __PUNCT__ challeng face our children is thi rise tide of autism __PUNCT__
that why as first ladi __PUNCT__ i fought hard for more awar and more fund for autism __PUNCT__
i wa veri proud when my husband sign the children health act of __NUM__ which had a special focu on autism research and launch a long __PUNCT__ term studi on environment influenc on children health __PUNCT__
in the senat __PUNCT__ i help develop and co __PUNCT__ sponsor the combat autism act of __NUM__ which wa sign into law by presid bush __PUNCT__
the bill author __MONEY__ billion over five year to combat autism through environment research __PUNCT__ surveil __PUNCT__ awar __PUNCT__ earli detect and earli intervent __PUNCT__
and in march of thi year __PUNCT__ i introduc the expand the promis for individu with autism act along with my colleagu __PUNCT__ senat allard from colorado __PUNCT__
thi focus on improv the qualiti of life for individu live with autism __PUNCT__ attain appropri servic that will cross the life span __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i will build on my work with a strong commit to fight autism __PUNCT__
i start __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ by invest heavili in research to understand the caus of autism and hopefulli to start find cure __PUNCT__
i will invest a total of __MONEY__ billion over five year to help fight autism __PUNCT__ becaus presid bush sign the bill but refus to provid the fund __PUNCT__ a familiar stori __PUNCT__
and he just veto a bill that congress includ fund for autism in __PUNCT__
specif __PUNCT__ we need to fund research to identifi the caus of autism __PUNCT__ includ possibl environment caus __PUNCT__
that includ expand our system for health track __PUNCT__ so that we can look for link between the environ and the rise of autism and other diseas __PUNCT__
that someth that i been fight for sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i introduc an environment health track bill everi congress sinc then becaus i think we need to face up to the fact that there ar three main caus of ill or condit that impact peopl __PUNCT__ genet __PUNCT__ behavior and environ and usual it a combin of on or more of those trigger __PUNCT__
and we haven't done enough to realli figur out to what it is we ar expos ourselv and our children to from the environ that trigger __PUNCT__ perhap __PUNCT__ a genet respons __PUNCT__ that make peopl who ar suscept to autism show that __PUNCT__
usual it diagnos around __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ if you lucki to find somebodi who know the condit __PUNCT__
lot of time it doesn't happen until the child is __NUM__ or __NUM__ and that mean that you delai the treatment and intervent that could help __PUNCT__
i also creat an autism task forc charg with investig evid __PUNCT__ base treatment __PUNCT__ intervent __PUNCT__ and servic __PUNCT__
i model thi after what ha happen in breast cancer __PUNCT__
breast cancer survivor becam partner with physician and scientist and research in find what wa go on that caus breast cancer and what the best treatment were __PUNCT__
onc the task forc ha done it work __PUNCT__ i act on it recommend __PUNCT__
more research is our best hope for combat autism __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will fund it __PUNCT__
for the children and adult who have autism __PUNCT__ i invest in the best possibl care throughout their lifetim __PUNCT__
i commit __MONEY__ million annual to provid care and improv the qualiti of life for individu live with autism __PUNCT__
thi start with better screen __PUNCT__
the american academi of pediatr recent call for a univers autism screen for all children under the ag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i applaud thi and we go to have to realli encourag the academi and pediatrician and other physician to learn about the signal and symptom and begin to coordin inform so thei can identifi it earlier __PUNCT__
to reinforc those effort __PUNCT__ i ensur that we get screen inform to profession who deal with young children through feder program such as head start __PUNCT__ medicaid and chip __PUNCT__
next __PUNCT__ i expand access to post __PUNCT__ diagnosi care so that we have a seamless transit from diagnosi to treatment __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the number of children affect is grow far faster than the care avail __PUNCT__
that mean parent often have to hear a doctor sai __PUNCT__ your child ha autism __PUNCT__ and then get sent awai with no good option for care __PUNCT__
thi is especi tragic becaus we know earli intervent can make all the differ __PUNCT__
as autist children reach school __PUNCT__ ag __PUNCT__ we support them in public school wherev possibl __PUNCT__
the number of children in public school with autism ha doubl in the past three year alon __PUNCT__
but the train for teacher hasn't __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ a lot of teacher get no train whatsoev __PUNCT__
i will provid fund for teacher train so thei can fulfil their mission of teach everi child __PUNCT__
and we won't stop care about autist individu just becaus thei grow up __PUNCT__
with access to the right type of servic __PUNCT__ includ hous __PUNCT__ vocat rehabilit __PUNCT__ we can help adult with autism live rich and full live __PUNCT__
so i will help state creat and provid appropri servic for adult with autism __PUNCT__
for parent __PUNCT__ we creat an onlin nation technic assist center to provid the best possibl inform about autism treatment __PUNCT__ intervent __PUNCT__ and servic __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will fund qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
my american health choic plan let you keep your exist coverag if you like it __PUNCT__ but it provid afford choic if you don't have them __PUNCT__ and it cover everi singl american __PUNCT__
what happen in famili of autism __PUNCT__ or famili with diabet or famili with a histori of cancer or heart diseas or ani other condit __PUNCT__ is that oftentim insur is so expens you can't afford it __PUNCT__ when the insur doesn't cover the veri thing you need it for __PUNCT__
everyon will have access to the same choic member of congress have __PUNCT__ which includ mental health care __PUNCT__
i alwai sai __PUNCT__ if it good enough for member of congress __PUNCT__ it good enough for american famili __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ you and your child will never be deni coverag becaus of pre __PUNCT__ exist condit or risk factor __PUNCT__
parent will no longer be burden by unmanag premium just becaus their children have autism __PUNCT__
and when all american have regular healthcar __PUNCT__ we be abl to reach so mani more children earli on __PUNCT__
my health plan __PUNCT__ my autism agenda __PUNCT__ and all of the polici that i put forward ar unit by my belief that it up to us to reclaim the futur for our children __PUNCT__ and ensur that everi child ha a chanc to live up to hi or her god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
we have learn that children and adult with autism have great potenti inde __PUNCT__
these ar not onli special need individu __PUNCT__ these ar special individu __PUNCT__
thei have a lot to offer __PUNCT__
just last week __PUNCT__ at an event in vinton __PUNCT__ sara seeli __PUNCT__ a young woman with autism __PUNCT__ i had no idea __PUNCT__ i wa just look out at a crowd like thi __PUNCT__ and she wa eagerli wave her hand with that big smile on her face __PUNCT__ ask a question about pollut and problem of deforest __PUNCT__
and she said later __PUNCT__ she is __PUNCT__ obsess with tiger __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i have no doubt that she will make a differ in our world __PUNCT__ and i am so pleas to be join by sara mom __PUNCT__ jane seeli __PUNCT__ and her doctor __PUNCT__ dr __PUNCT__ patricia gilbaugh __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__
sara not alon __PUNCT__
so we should never give up on ani child __PUNCT__ i think that is on of our oblig __PUNCT__
and togeth __PUNCT__ we can help all those live with autism to live up to their potenti __PUNCT__
and we can commit ourselv to conquer thi realli difficult and veri frustrat and discourag condit that strike children __PUNCT__ liter out of the blue __PUNCT__
there is no marker for it __PUNCT__ we don't know it come __PUNCT__ and oftentim thei ar not quit sure what is happen until the diagnosi is deliv __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ now i want to turn to three peopl who have live with it __PUNCT__ who can add to what i said befor we turn to take your question on ani issu that on your mind __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
