i also want to thank all the other veteran __PUNCT__ former offic __PUNCT__ noncommiss offic who ar here with me and i want to also express my appreci to all who ar support me in thi campaign __PUNCT__
we ar here at such an extraordinari moment in american histori __PUNCT__
the stake have rare been higher __PUNCT__
i had numer historian tell me that america point in our arch of destini __PUNCT__ todai is perhap most similar to the situat confront presid truman when he becam our presid and command in chief __PUNCT__
dramat event dure thi past week have remind us how volatil our world ha becom and how essenti it is that we have sound strategi and strong leadership __PUNCT__
from kosovo to cuba __PUNCT__ from iraq to pakistan __PUNCT__ to our embassi be burn in belgrad __PUNCT__ these ar some of the most challeng spot on our global map __PUNCT__
the world is be transform with enorm risk and possibl that we must meet with confid __PUNCT__ optim __PUNCT__ resolut and success __PUNCT__
the next presid will inherit all of these global challeng and more from a presid who fail to handl them well __PUNCT__
a war in afghanistan and a war in iraq __PUNCT__
america reput at an all __PUNCT__ time low __PUNCT__
countri rush to acquir nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
crush poverti that stymi econom and polit progress in too mani region of the world __PUNCT__
global warm and global health pandem __PUNCT__
genocid in darfur __PUNCT__
a rise of borderless __PUNCT__ stateless crimin cartel __PUNCT__
and the continu real threat of terror here at home and abroad __PUNCT__
but while these stark realiti carri danger __PUNCT__ thei also bring unpreced opportun if we act wise __PUNCT__ if we have the right kind of leadership __PUNCT__
there isn't ani doubt in my mind that we will not onli navig through these unchart difficult water but emerg stronger than ever __PUNCT__ reassert both our leadership and our moral author __PUNCT__
the vision i have for america is on that is root in those valu __PUNCT__
valu that have serv us well but have been temporarili sidelin becaus of thi administr approach to the world __PUNCT__
over the past seven year __PUNCT__ we seen what happen when the presid present the american peopl with a seri of fals choic and then is indiffer about the consequ __PUNCT__ forc versu diplomaci __PUNCT__ unilater versu multilater __PUNCT__ hard power versu soft __PUNCT__
we seen the tragic result of have a presid who had neither the experi nor the wisdom to manag our foreign polici and safeguard our nation secur __PUNCT__
we can't let that happen again __PUNCT__
america ha alreadi taken that chanc __PUNCT__ on time too mani __PUNCT__
the symbol of our presid __PUNCT__ the american eagl __PUNCT__ hold arrow in on talon and an oliv branch in the other __PUNCT__
both ar symbol tool of what we need to keep our democraci strong and our nation safe __PUNCT__ tool that a presid must know how to us in the daili cours of event __PUNCT__ but also when that __NUM__ a.m __PUNCT__ phone call come to the white hous becaus an unforeseen crisi ha erupt without warn __PUNCT__
in that split second the presid ha to respond and make a decis that could affect the safeti and live of million of peopl here in our countri and around the world __PUNCT__
whoever sit at that desk in the oval offic on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ need all the tool avail __PUNCT__ all the resourc at our dispos __PUNCT__ and the wisdom to know how to us them __PUNCT__
i propos a new american strategi to restor our moral author __PUNCT__ end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and defend and protect our nation __PUNCT__
we need a presid who understand there is a time for forc __PUNCT__ a time for diplomaci __PUNCT__ and a time for both __PUNCT__ who understand that we enhanc our intern reput and strengthen our secur if the world see the human face of american democraci in the good work __PUNCT__ the good deed we do for peopl seek freedom from poverti __PUNCT__ hunger __PUNCT__ diseas __PUNCT__ illiteraci __PUNCT__ and oppress __PUNCT__
with me __PUNCT__ thi is not theoret __PUNCT__
thi is veri much who i am __PUNCT__ what i have done __PUNCT__ and what i will do __PUNCT__
the american peopl don't have to guess whether i understand the issu or whether i would need a foreign polici instruct manual to guid me through a crisi or whether i have to reli on advis to introduc me to global affair __PUNCT__
i lucki to have had a pretti good insid view __PUNCT__ over eight year in the white hous and now over seven year in the senat __PUNCT__ of what the presid goe through dai in and dai out deal with all of these challeng __PUNCT__
obvious the work that i have done on human right __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ intern develop give me a deep appreci of the import of win the heart and mind of those in societi whether or not thei ar for us todai __PUNCT__
i believ that we can seed democraci and creat new strong allianc oversea __PUNCT__
and i also know from my year serv on the senat arm servic committe that our militari power is absolut essenti but it cannot be view as the solut to everi intern problem __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we must us forc when necessari but as a last resort __PUNCT__ not a first resort __PUNCT__
as on piec of a comprehens strategi to defend our nation and promot our valu __PUNCT__
i been honor to travel to more than __NUM__ countri repres the unit state __PUNCT__
in session with foreign leader __PUNCT__ with influenti citizen from the world of busi __PUNCT__ academia __PUNCT__ human right and so much els __PUNCT__
i have travel to iraq and afghanistan three time __PUNCT__
and i seen and have said repeatedli that we must revis our strategi in afghanistan __PUNCT__
when i first went to afghanistan in __NUM__ i wa met by a soldier who said __PUNCT__ welcom to the forgotten front line in the war against terror __PUNCT__
i regret to sai that those front line ar still larg forgotten __PUNCT__
it will take a new polici toward pakistan __PUNCT__ on that build on the democrat yearn express by the pakistani peopl in elect last week and recogn that the border area between pakistan and afghanistan ar among the most import and danger in the world __PUNCT__
ignor these realiti of what is happen on the ground in both afghanistan and pakistan ha been on of the most danger failur of the bush foreign polici __PUNCT__
i have been to africa and have seen how diseas __PUNCT__ hiv __PUNCT__ aid __PUNCT__ tuberculosi __PUNCT__ malaria __PUNCT__ undermin progress across an entir contin __PUNCT__
i push our govern to start battl the global aid epidem becaus thi affect our secur too __PUNCT__
i veri hope that we will make progress in africa deal with the multipl of challeng that the contin face __PUNCT__
it wa my great honor to go to africa in the mid 1990 as a precursor to my husband trip and i applaud presid bush and mr __PUNCT__ bush for go back __PUNCT__
we need a consist coher strategi in deal with africa and that is someth that i will promot __PUNCT__
i also veri proud that the unit state joint forc command invit me to be the onli senat to serv on the transform advisori group __PUNCT__ which studi and propos idea to modern and strengthen our militari __PUNCT__ to meet new and emerg global threat __PUNCT__
that experi reinforc my commit to look at everi singl challeng we face not through a narrow prism but a broad overview becaus it is all interconnect __PUNCT__ what kind of militari we need __PUNCT__ what tool we provid our men and women who serv us is directli relat to what it is we ar try to accomplish and how best to util those resourc effect __PUNCT__
i know veri well that in exercis foreign polici you have to know both how to find common ground and how to stand our ground __PUNCT__
deal with the rise power of china provid an exampl __PUNCT__
i went to beij in __NUM__ and spoke out for women right and human right __PUNCT__
the chines govern wasn't happi __PUNCT__ thei pull the plug on the broadcast of my speech __PUNCT__
but i took that as a compliment __PUNCT__
becaus it wa import for the unit state both to be repres and to make absolut clear that human right is an integr part of our foreign polici and that women right is kei to that __PUNCT__
what we have learn is that where women ar oppress and deni their basic right we ar more like to have regim that ar more adversari to american interest and valu __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ china is most obvious the world largest and on of it fastest grow economi __PUNCT__
it becom a global superpow that need to be convinc to plai by the rule in the global marketplac __PUNCT__
here again __PUNCT__ the bush administr ha fail __PUNCT__
on third of our trade deficit is with china and over the cours of the last seven year bush polici have ha allow the chines govern to becom our banker __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ china steel come here and our job go there __PUNCT__
we plai by the rule and thei manipul their currenc __PUNCT__
we get taint fish and lead __PUNCT__ lace toi and poison pet food in return __PUNCT__
that will chang when i am in the white hous becaus i know we have got to take a consist approach toward china __PUNCT__
i co __PUNCT__ sponsor legisl to compel the administr to take aggress step to stop china from manipul it currenc __PUNCT__ to make our good look more expens __PUNCT__
i the origin co __PUNCT__ sponsor of the foreign debt ceil act which realli mean that we would requir ani administr to begin revers our trade deficit and start break our relianc on china for not onli what thei provid to us in term of the wai thei bui our dollar and bui our debt but also to be held to higher standard for what thei import into our market __PUNCT__
we have to make sure that american compani have a level plai field when it come to trade __PUNCT__
we far from reach that goal __PUNCT__
and i think it imper that we move becaus what is happen is that our standard of live in america is deterior __PUNCT__
that ha direct and seriou implic for our capac to oper effect on behalf of our strateg interest in the world __PUNCT__
it veri difficult to persuad the american peopl that we must continu to lead __PUNCT__ that ye __PUNCT__ there will be occas when we have to sacrific in further of our valu and interest if the standard of live __PUNCT__ the famili incom here at home is deterior __PUNCT__
so thi is someth that ha to be seen as a whole __PUNCT__
our fiscal irrespons over the last seven year ha undermin our abil to be the leader we need to be in the world __PUNCT__
you cannot talk about our militari and our other object strateg and have mire ourselv in debt and depend upon foreign countri to keep us afloat __PUNCT__
that also goe hand in hand with our continu refus to have an energi polici that is in line with our strateg object __PUNCT__
so when we talk about foreign polici __PUNCT__ we have to talk about fiscal polici __PUNCT__ energi polici and so much els besid just the narrow view that ha been primarili driven by the bush administr over the last seven year __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ in order to address these new challeng we do have to set a new tone both here at home and around the world __PUNCT__
that requir that we start with the most basic of duti __PUNCT__
a command in chief must protect and defend our nation __PUNCT__
on my first dai in offic __PUNCT__ i will announc __PUNCT__ as i have repeatedli in thi campaign __PUNCT__ that the era of cowboi diplomaci is over __PUNCT__
that includ the doctrin of pre __PUNCT__ emptiv war __PUNCT__
i have been against that for mani year __PUNCT__
i believ it led us into a blind allei and i don't think i need to remind the retir flag offic here todai how difficult the choic made by the presid have been for american militari __PUNCT__
we need a new nation militari strategi that emploi militari power wise instead of squander it __PUNCT__
that requir us to begin to bring out troop home from iraq within __NUM__ dai of the new presid take offic __PUNCT__
i believ we can redeploi on to two brigad a month but i also believ it will be danger __PUNCT__
there been a lot of talk about withdraw and redeploy and i think it need to be put into an appropri context __PUNCT__
withdraw troop is not easi __PUNCT__
on doe not wake up in the morn and sai let bring them home __PUNCT__
it requir plan that look at everi possibl conting __PUNCT__
that why last spring i began push the bush administr to tell us what plan had gone on __PUNCT__ whether thei were readi to bring our young men and women home __PUNCT__
thei didn't want to talk to us about it __PUNCT__ as is their usual respons __PUNCT__
we final were abl to secur a brief which although classifi __PUNCT__ i can tell you wa cursori __PUNCT__
it did not inspir confid in our readi to do thi import task of withdraw our troop and equip __PUNCT__
i think it is also import that we look at what els need to happen simultan __PUNCT__
we have __NUM__ or so american civilian in iraq __PUNCT__
thei work at the embassi and other govern agenc __PUNCT__ for busi and chariti __PUNCT__
we need a plan for them as well __PUNCT__
and we also have iraqi who side with us __PUNCT__
on of the young offic who spoke in the pre __PUNCT__ program is someon i have known a long time __PUNCT__ someon i known quit a long time __PUNCT__
marin captain iscol who began talk to me about the need to take care of those who take care of our troop __PUNCT__ translat and driver __PUNCT__
when captain iscol wa lead hi men in the battl that retook fallujah __PUNCT__ he ha said __PUNCT__ as i heard other young marin offic who were part of that battl tell me __PUNCT__ thei would not have surviv had it not been for their translat __PUNCT__
honor is import __PUNCT__
it import to our countri __PUNCT__
we ar an honor nation therefor we must do more to take care of those who side with __PUNCT__ protect and save the live of young american in iraq __PUNCT__
if i am entrust with the presid __PUNCT__ america will have the courag __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ to meet with our adversari __PUNCT__
but i will not be pencil in the leader of iran or north korea or venezuela or cuba on the presidenti calendar without precondit __PUNCT__ until we have assess through lower level diplomaci __PUNCT__ the motiv and intent of these dictat __PUNCT__
raul castro __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ ha a stark choic __PUNCT__
he can continu to stifl human right and econom freedom in cuba __PUNCT__ or he can chart a new cours toward democrat reform __PUNCT__
we need to engag with our alli in latin america and europ to encourag cuba on to the right path __PUNCT__
but we simpli cannot legitim rogu regim or weaken american prestig by impuls agre to presidenti level talk that have no precondit __PUNCT__
it mai sound good but it doesn't meet the real world test of foreign polici __PUNCT__
i have travel to so mani countri work on issu involv some of the most intract challeng we face __PUNCT__
and as we see peopl respond to their own condit __PUNCT__ we have to be readi to act __PUNCT__
the clearest exampl of that is what just happen in pakistan __PUNCT__
the pakistani peopl essenti repudi the bush administr polici and creat a new dynam that could lead to greater freedom and democraci or to a greater crisi with implic for the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
on thing the american peopl can be sure of __PUNCT__ i will not broadcast threat of unilater militari action against a countri like pakistan just to demonstr that i am tough enough for the job __PUNCT__
we have to chang our tone and chang our cours __PUNCT__
so let begin by reviv old fashion diplomaci __PUNCT__
on of my critic of the bush administr is that thei have such a narrow circl of peopl advis the presid __PUNCT__
appar there is onli on diplomat the presid will send anywher and that is secretari rice __PUNCT__
so if secretari rice can't get to the middl east or get to pakistan or get to africa or get anywher __PUNCT__ you don't get the feel that the presid is engag __PUNCT__
i think that is a terribl failur __PUNCT__
the presid need to have a broad circl of advis call upon distinguish american both in and out of govern to serv as presidenti envoi __PUNCT__ someth that i urg when i came back from pakistan and afghanistan last __DATE__ __PUNCT__
i urg the white hous to send a high __PUNCT__ level presidenti envoi __PUNCT__
i said there is a lot of misunderstand between presid musharraf and presid karzai and it is go to caus us problem __PUNCT__
that wa not accept by the white hous and instead __PUNCT__ full support continu for presid musharraf as he move further and further awai from democraci __PUNCT__ as hi strategi for battl al qaeda __PUNCT__ the taliban and other extremist prove time and time again to be inadequ __PUNCT__
we have a new opportun now __PUNCT__
we need to be support those in pakistan from the middl class __PUNCT__ from the profess who ar our natur alli in order to give american approv to the chang that have taken place in the elect __PUNCT__
the more we have peopl invest in their own futur __PUNCT__ the more like thei ar to work with us to protect our futur __PUNCT__
that is what i will attempt to do __PUNCT__
it is also import that we reviv our commit at a veri public level to human right and individu freedom __PUNCT__
let close guantanamo __PUNCT__
let make it clear that we will never sanction tortur and we will stand for the rule of law __PUNCT__
let build a real coalit of alli to defeat terrorist in afghanistan and other countri that provid a safe haven for al qaeda __PUNCT__
let make it clear that ani terrorist who attack the unit state __PUNCT__ who have safe haven in ani countri __PUNCT__ ar put that countri at risk __PUNCT__
that is on wai for us to demonstr that we will not be the aggressor __PUNCT__ we will not engag in pre __PUNCT__ emptiv attack __PUNCT__ but we will defend our nation __PUNCT__
we need __PUNCT__ also __PUNCT__ to begin to be seriou about darfur __PUNCT__
everydai we fail to act __PUNCT__ the betray of fundament valu __PUNCT__
the peac keep forc ha not been deploi for reason mani of you know __PUNCT__ object by member of the secur counsel among other __PUNCT__
the unit state ha to be push much more aggress to get that done __PUNCT__
we also do need to lead the world toward a sound energi polici that treat global warm as the crisi it is and not scienc fiction __PUNCT__
i have said that i would meet with the countri that ar the biggest emitt of greenhous ga emiss until we hammer out an agreement __PUNCT__ hopefulli within a year that would china and india who have to be part of the solut __PUNCT__
we also need to be move quickli toward a come to term with our oil compani and our oil produc countri alli __PUNCT__
we need to demonstr our commit to home __PUNCT__ grown energi __PUNCT__
we can't do that __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__ until the two oil men leav the white hous but as soon as thei do __PUNCT__ we have to be readi aggress __PUNCT__
we will lead the world in combat aid __PUNCT__
i wa proud to sign a pledg to invest __MONEY__ billion by __NUM__ to combat aid across the globe __PUNCT__
we will lead the world in stand up for women right and i know that thi is an issu that goe to the heart of who we ar as a nation __PUNCT__
becaus when women continu to compris the major of the world unhealthi __PUNCT__ unf and unschool __PUNCT__ the global commun cannot prosper or make progress __PUNCT__
when women continu to be rape as a tactic of war __PUNCT__ traffick by crimin cartel __PUNCT__ and subject to violenc both in and out of their home __PUNCT__ that compromis the digniti and human of the entir human famili __PUNCT__
we will also lead in provid opportun to the world children __PUNCT__
when __NUM__ million children in the develop world don't attend school and __NUM__ million more drop out befor finish the first grade __PUNCT__ that is a recip for poverti __PUNCT__ instabl and extrem __PUNCT__
that why i have introduc the bipartisan educ for all act __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion over five year for the goal of basic educ for everi boi and everi girl around the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that is the begin of the secur agenda that i would begin implement within the first __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
we all know that we have a lot of work to do to repair the damag that we will inherit __PUNCT__
in thi campaign peopl ar offer clear choic __PUNCT__
senat mccain is a friend of mine __PUNCT__
he is to be commend for hi courag servic to our nation dure the vietnam war __PUNCT__
but in term of foreign and secur polici __PUNCT__ in the calamit wake of presid bush __PUNCT__ senat mccain can't seem to budg from bush approach that insist on us militari forc when diplomaci is need __PUNCT__
he ha said he want to keep our troop in iraq __PUNCT__
it would be fine with him for __NUM__ to __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i will start bring them home within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
it also import that we combin all of our tool __PUNCT__ econom aid __PUNCT__ humanitarian aid __PUNCT__ focus on issu like diseas __PUNCT__ children school and women place __PUNCT__ someth that i believ i will be much better abl to do __PUNCT__
senat obama __PUNCT__ meanwhil __PUNCT__ repres anoth choic __PUNCT__
he waver from seem to believ that mediat and meet without precondit can solv the world most intract problem __PUNCT__
to advoc rash unilater militari action without cooper from our alli in the most sensit region of the world __PUNCT__
elect a presid should not be an either/or proposit when it come to nation secur __PUNCT__
we need a presid who know how to deploi both the oliv branch and the arrow __PUNCT__ who will be readi to act swiftli and decis in a crisi __PUNCT__ who will pursu strateg demand of hard diplomaci to re __PUNCT__ establish moral author and our leadership __PUNCT__
in thi moment of peril and promis __PUNCT__ we need a presid who is test and readi __PUNCT__ who can draw on year of real world experi work on mani of the issu that we now confront __PUNCT__ who know when to stand on ground and when to seek common ground __PUNCT__ who ha the strength and fortitud to meet the challeng head on without fear and without sow fear __PUNCT__
i believ i am the candid most readi todai to be that kind of presid and command in chief __PUNCT__
i will never let america good name be disgrac __PUNCT__
i will alwai protect and defend our nation and i will alwai advanc the tradit and valu that have made our countri __PUNCT__ as presid lincoln said __PUNCT__ the last best hope on earth __PUNCT__
thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
i also want to recogn lieuten governor anthoni brown __PUNCT__ an iraq war veteran __PUNCT__ the lieuten governor of maryland __PUNCT__
i proud to have hi support __PUNCT__
