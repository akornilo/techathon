__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you know what i think __PUNCT__ is that thi is the closest elect we ever had that anybodi can rememb __PUNCT__
each of us ha brought million of new peopl into the process __PUNCT__
i think i now been privileg to receiv the vote of __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
and that pretti much the same as senat obama __PUNCT__
the deleg race remain close __PUNCT__
we have contest yet to go __PUNCT__
peopl have been try to end it __PUNCT__
and the voter just won't let it happen __PUNCT__
as a recent poll suggest __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of democrat want to see thi continu __PUNCT__
and i think for good reason __PUNCT__ becaus it on of the most substant __PUNCT__ excit __PUNCT__ energ polit event i can rememb in my lifetim __PUNCT__
and there is no winner yet __PUNCT__
you have to have __PUNCT__ now with the special elect of a democrat from mississippi __PUNCT__ __NUM__ deleg to actual stai __PUNCT__

blitzer __PUNCT__ thei have to make a decis __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ what do you want them to do __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what i would want them to do is to seat the whole deleg base on the vote that were taken __PUNCT__ becaus i think the voter who came out __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ million of them in both state __PUNCT__ clearli believ that their vote would count __PUNCT__
and thei mai have violat the dnc rule __PUNCT__ but other state did as well __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus right now the dnc sai that the number is __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ __NUM__ or __NUM__ __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ that just not a practic answer __PUNCT__
that would mean that onli __NUM__ state would determin who the nomine of the democrat parti is __PUNCT__
and that not the wai the elect work __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ so you stai in at least through __DATE__ and __DATE__ __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ which is the last __PUNCT__ you not go anywher __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i not go anywher __PUNCT__ wolf __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__
except to kentucki and oregon and montana and south dakota __PUNCT__ and puerto rico __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ in these remain state __PUNCT__
let talk about some of the issu __PUNCT__ the kei issu __PUNCT__ the econom issu __PUNCT__ issu no __PUNCT__
__NUM__ the economi __PUNCT__
ga price __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__
you said in recent dai you want to get tough with the major oil export countri __PUNCT__ opec __PUNCT__ becaus of the huge cost per barrel __PUNCT__ the result price of a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
but when you sai get tough with opec __PUNCT__ what doe it mean when you have member of opec like ahmadinejad of iran or hugo chavez of venezuela __PUNCT__ or gaddafi of libya __PUNCT__ how do you plan on get tough with them __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i actual have a four __PUNCT__ part program that i would put into effect were i presid todai to deal with these rise ga price __PUNCT__ which ar go to hit __MONEY__ soon __PUNCT__
and it an enorm burden on peopl who drive ani consider distanc __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but what kind of leverag do you have on opec __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ four thing __PUNCT__ and i get to opec quickli __PUNCT__
i would go after the energi trader and specul __PUNCT__
i think thei ar ad to the cost of a barrel of oil __PUNCT__
i believ there is signific evid of that __PUNCT__
so i would launch a depart of justice/feder trade commiss investig and realli try to rein them in and close what call the __PUNCT__ enron loophol __PUNCT__
i approv and vote for what the congress did yesterdai __PUNCT__ which is to quit fill up the strateg petroleum reserv __PUNCT__ and i would even releas some monei __PUNCT__
i have advoc a ga tax holidai that is paid for __PUNCT__
that is not what senat mccain want __PUNCT__
he want on that is not paid for __PUNCT__
and senat obama doesn't want on at all __PUNCT__
but i would pai for it out of the record profit of the oil compani __PUNCT__
nine countri that ar member of opec ar member of the wto __PUNCT__ the world trade organ __PUNCT__ where thei have agre to certain rule that i believ opec by definit violat __PUNCT__
also __PUNCT__ we have never us antitrust law in our countri to realli go at the heart of what is a monopoli cartel __PUNCT__
there is someth fundament wrong and outdat in have the oil __PUNCT__ produc countri get togeth a coupl of time a year and sai __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ here how much we go to produc and here how much we go to charg for it __PUNCT__
and i think there is enough market power in the world __PUNCT__ if we us the tool avail to us __PUNCT__ to rein that in __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus barack obama sai thi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ you sai you been in the white hous for eight year __PUNCT__ you had two term as a unit state senat __PUNCT__ and haven't said a word about opec __PUNCT__
and now suddenli you go to take it right to opec __PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he wrong about that __PUNCT__
i have vote __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ in the senat on sever occas to try to get the presid of the unit state to do someth about opec __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ presid bush wasn't inclin to do so __PUNCT__ the republican congress befor him wa not inclin to do so __PUNCT__
so we go to have __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__ a democrat presid and a democrat congress __PUNCT__
that is the time when we be abl to take on thi unfinish busi when it come to energi __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ look back __PUNCT__ did the clinton administr __PUNCT__ dure eight year of your husband in the white hous __PUNCT__ do enough toward energi independ __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei certainli tri between both the presid and the vice presid __PUNCT__
and my husband often sai laughingli that tax credit and energi program were the onli thing that he couldn't get the republican congress to even look at __PUNCT__ becaus obvious thei had a veri differ view about what we should be do __PUNCT__
but now i think it clear to everyon __PUNCT__ even the republican nomine __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ who ha been veri eloqu in the last few dai __PUNCT__ talk about how we have to cap greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ thi is not a republican or democrat issu __PUNCT__
we need a long __PUNCT__ term strategi __PUNCT__ like the on i outlin on my web site __PUNCT__ __URL__
you can read all about it __PUNCT__
and we need a short __PUNCT__ term strategi to try to provid relief to citizen right now __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ you were recent ask about your propos to have a holidai on the ga tax __PUNCT__
and you would pai for it by have a windfal profit tax on exxonmobil and some of the other big oil compani __PUNCT__
and then when you were press on economist who would endors your idea __PUNCT__ you said you not go to put your lot in with economist __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ which rais question __PUNCT__
ar you not go to believ in what economist sai __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ but i think there that old sai __PUNCT__
you can find an economist to sai nearli anyth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some of the economist were against it becaus thei misunderstood my polici __PUNCT__
thei thought it wasn't paid for __PUNCT__
and i would agre with those who said we can't afford a ga tax holidai that will add to the deficit __PUNCT__ that will take monei out of the highwai trust fund __PUNCT__
other ar against the mechan of a windfal profit tax __PUNCT__
thei think that doesn't necessarili work well and that the cost will be pass on __PUNCT__
my attitud is i think we could design such a windfal profit tax that would work __PUNCT__ that would be enforc and that would not be pass on __PUNCT__
i have been advoc a windfal profit tax on the oil compani to supplement a strateg energi fund that i have recommend for more than three year __PUNCT__ and it becaus i think that there is such a disconnect between what the oil compani have been rake in as profit and ani compar invest or effort that thei made to produc those profit __PUNCT__
there doe seem to me to be an opportun here both to take awai the subsidi for the oil compani __PUNCT__ which clearli don't need our tax dollar to make these huge profit __PUNCT__ and to try to impos a windfal profit tax __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but you will consult with economist __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ you believ in economist __PUNCT__ and if you presid of the unit state you work with economist __PUNCT__ becaus when you said __PUNCT__ i not go to put your lot in with economist __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ not total __PUNCT__
not total __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ sometim economist ar not right __PUNCT__
and i think there ar polit __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but most of the economist have critic your plan __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ some of them didn't understand it and some of them don't believ it could be done __PUNCT__
but you listen to all kind of advis __PUNCT__ but then you have to try to make up your mind __PUNCT__
franklin roosevelt __PUNCT__ dure the new deal __PUNCT__ a lot of economist said that a terribl idea __PUNCT__ you go to be prime the pump __PUNCT__ you go to be put peopl to work __PUNCT__
that a terribl idea __PUNCT__ that a betray of the american capitalist system __PUNCT__
but he said __PUNCT__ you know we got to put peopl to work __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think we got to reign in the oil compani __PUNCT__
and there ar certainli econom appropri wai of do that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ stand by for much more of my interview with senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__
she strongli defend barack obama from hi critic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i think that that realli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ just an overstat and exagger of ani kind of __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ polit mean __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ so what exagger about obama is clinton talk about __PUNCT__ you go to find out __PUNCT__
that come up in my next instal of thi interview __PUNCT__
plu __PUNCT__ the on thing in our interview that got senat clinton rather emot __PUNCT__
you want to see thi __PUNCT__
and a new shocker in the battl for control of congress __PUNCT__
we go to tell you why it could help senat obama make hi case that he can win the white hous __PUNCT__
stai with us __PUNCT__
you in __PUNCT__ the situat room __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ now back to my interview with senat hillari clinton on racial divis in the democrat parti and on global tension that some sai could plai to john mccain strength __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin videotap __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ when it come to the war in iraq __PUNCT__ anoth issu on the mind of american right now __PUNCT__ you critic senat mccain for suggest u. __PUNCT__ troop could stai there perhap for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
but you yourself back in __NUM__ suggest __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ if there a peac environ like along the line of korea or germani or okinawa __PUNCT__ mayb it wouldn't be that bad for a long __PUNCT__ term u. __PUNCT__ militari presenc in that kind of environ __PUNCT__
is the critic of senat mccain __PUNCT__ who made similar comment __PUNCT__ is it warrant __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think it is for thi reason __PUNCT__ that there isn't ani signific mileston that the iraqi govern ha met __PUNCT__
it a veri differ situat than germani or korea __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but if thei were to meet those mileston and if there were a new peac environ __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ but wolf __PUNCT__ i don't think though __PUNCT__ i think you confus kind of caus and effect __PUNCT__
i don't believ that thei will seriou attempt to meet those mileston until thei ar absolut convinc we ar go to withdraw __PUNCT__
i believ that is the best wai to focu their attent __PUNCT__
everyth we tri __PUNCT__ includ the most recent effort with the surg __PUNCT__ ha not result in the gain that were either hope for or forecast __PUNCT__
i believ we got to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
there ar continu mission __PUNCT__ guard our embassi __PUNCT__ special forc perhap deal with al qaeda __PUNCT__ but that a veri differ scenario than what we have todai __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ i would begin to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ the isra ar celebr their __NUM__ anniversari right now as an independ state __PUNCT__
here is what mccain said about barack obama __PUNCT__
and i want to get your reaction __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ thi is mccain __PUNCT__ i think it veri clear who hama want to be the next presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i think that peopl should understand that i will be hama __PUNCT__ worst nightmar __PUNCT__
if senat obama is favor by hama __PUNCT__ i think peopl can make judgment accordingli __PUNCT__
mccain wa refer to a statement by the north american spokesman for hama endors __PUNCT__ in effect __PUNCT__ barack obama __PUNCT__
is mccain right __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i think that that realli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ just an overstat __PUNCT__ an exagger of ani kind of __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ polit mean __PUNCT__
and i don't think that anybodi should take that serious __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ but you have confid in barack obama as presid would be a strong support of israel __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ i would __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i do __PUNCT__
i would believ that that would be the polici of the unit state __PUNCT__ and it been our polici for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus the critic he get from mccain and hi support __PUNCT__ mccain support __PUNCT__ is that he would be will to meet uncondition with the leader of iran __PUNCT__ mahmoud ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ and given the statement that ahmadinejad ha made about destroi israel __PUNCT__ that doesn't __PUNCT__ that doesn't reassur __PUNCT__ let sai __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think that a differ issu __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i object when that statement wa made back in an earli debat __PUNCT__ becaus i don't believ that a unit state presid should commit to meet uncondition with leader of rogu nation __PUNCT__
that doesn't mean you don't eventu meet with them under appropri circumst __PUNCT__ but not without condit __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ let talk about an issu that come up in thi campaign __PUNCT__
the issu of race in the campaign __PUNCT__
you were wide quot in that __PUNCT__ usa todai __PUNCT__ interview __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin audio clip __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ there wa just an __PUNCT__ a.p __PUNCT__ articl post that found how senat obama support among work __PUNCT__ hard work american __PUNCT__ white american __PUNCT__ is weaken again __PUNCT__ and how the __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ white in both state who had not complet colleg were support me __PUNCT__
i have a much broader base to build a win coalit on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end audio clip __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ your great friend and support __PUNCT__ congressman charli rangel __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__ and i quot now __PUNCT__ it the dumbest thing you could have said __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he probabl right __PUNCT__

we got to get to that __NUM__ elector vote margin __PUNCT__
and i know senat obama ha work hard to reach out to everi commun and constitu __PUNCT__
so i go to continu to do that __PUNCT__
that what i think is in the best interest of our parti and that how we will win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ as someon who ha champion civil right all of these year __PUNCT__ and you see all these stori come up __PUNCT__ and he get __NUM__ percent of the african __PUNCT__ american vote __PUNCT__ you do well with these white work class voter __PUNCT__ as you did in west virginia __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__ in ohio __PUNCT__ how doe that make you feel when you see thi issu all of a sudden explod out there __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i obvious regret peopl explod an issu like that becaus i think it not onli unfound but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it offens __PUNCT__

i think thei vote for each of us for whatev combin of reason that appeal to the individu voter __PUNCT__
that the wai it suppos to be in america __PUNCT__
and i work veri hard to make it clear to peopl in thi campaign that we need a champion back in the white hous __PUNCT__
i am not on who believ that we go to be abl to come to washington in __NUM__ hold hand with everybodi __PUNCT__ and take on the drug compani and the oil compani and the health insur compani __PUNCT__ and everyth we have to do __PUNCT__ and that just somehow that will all happen __PUNCT__
i think polit is the hard bore of hard board __PUNCT__ as max weber said __PUNCT__
and from my perspect __PUNCT__ peopl who know how hard it will be to creat the chang we need ar attract to my candidaci __PUNCT__
peopl who feel that mayb life hasn't been fair __PUNCT__ the odd ar stack against them __PUNCT__ thei want somebodi who is go to go to bat for them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ and you also got a chanc to ask senat clinton someth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ unidentifi male __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ i have a question for you __PUNCT__
i wa wonder __PUNCT__ why do you believ that so mani of your strongest democrat support sai that thei would vote for senat mccain over senat obama in the fall if you were not to win the nomin __PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ as a cnn ireport __PUNCT__ you pose question like that on __PUNCT__
straight ahead __PUNCT__ you go to find out how she answer those question __PUNCT__
also __PUNCT__ on question i ask her actual made senat clinton veri emot __PUNCT__
you go to want to hear exactli what wa ask and how she respond __PUNCT__
stai with us __PUNCT__
more of the interview with senat clinton right after thi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ commerci break __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ we continu now with my interview with senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__
she defend her decis to keep on fight __PUNCT__ and she vow her parti will be unit in the end __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin videotap __PUNCT__ blitzer __PUNCT__ at __URL__ we invit peopl to submit a question through our ireport __PUNCT__
a coupl came in that i want to plai for you __PUNCT__ get your brief respons __PUNCT__
thi on wa from someon name billi sutton __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__
he is a clinton support __PUNCT__ turn __PUNCT__ obama support __PUNCT__
but watch thi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ unidentifi male __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ i have a question for you __PUNCT__
i wa wonder __PUNCT__ why do you believ that so mani of your strongest democrat support sai that thei would vote for senat mccain over senat obama in the fall if you were not to win the nomin __PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i heard that from both my support and senat obama support __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus the exit poll show that __PUNCT__ a big chunk of it __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ both hi support and my support might stai home or not vote for the other __PUNCT__ and i just have to sai as strongli as i can __PUNCT__ billi __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__ that that would be a terribl mistak __PUNCT__
anybodi that ha ever vote for me or vote for barack ha much more in common in term of what we want to see happen in our countri and in the world with the other than thei do with john mccain __PUNCT__
so i go to work my heart out for whoever our nomine is __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ i still hope to be that nomine __PUNCT__
but i go to do everyth i can to make sure that anyon who support me __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ million peopl who have vote for me __PUNCT__ understand what a grave error it would be not to vote for senat mccain __PUNCT__ senat obama and against senat mccain __PUNCT__
and i know that senat obama ha said that he will do the same to campaign for me __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ in the heat of a primari campaign peopl get __PUNCT__ their passion ar high __PUNCT__ thei feel intens __PUNCT__
that all understand __PUNCT__
but onc we have a nomine __PUNCT__ we go to have a unifi democrat parti __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ becaus mario cuomo __PUNCT__ the former governor of new york __PUNCT__ among other __PUNCT__ sai the best wai to heal thi democrat parti __PUNCT__ irrespect of who get the nomin __PUNCT__ is for the two of you to be on the ticket __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__
i think he made a speech or wrote someth to that effect __PUNCT__
and it prematur for either of us to talk about that __PUNCT__
i think both of us ar commit to do everyth we can to win in the fall __PUNCT__
i certainli am __PUNCT__
and i will do __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ i will do whatev it take __PUNCT__ becaus i know what four more year of basic the same bush polici would mean to america __PUNCT__ even though thei would be carri out by someon els __PUNCT__
thei ar more of the same __PUNCT__
and we cannot afford that __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ we also got a variant of thi question from a lot of our viewer __PUNCT__
thi wa from a mccain support __PUNCT__
he ask thi question __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ begin video clip __PUNCT__ unidentifi male __PUNCT__ why do you continu to stai in thi race for the democrat nomin __PUNCT__ barack obama is well ahead of you in the deleg and now ahead of you in the superdeleg __PUNCT__
mani of them have switch to him after he won by a larg margin over you in north carolina primari last week __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end video clip __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i realli touch that a mccain support would be so concern about our primari __PUNCT__
but let me sai that __PUNCT__ after my big win last night in west virginia __PUNCT__ the deleg differ is extrem narrow __PUNCT__
it is __PUNCT__ peopl have gone to convent and fought out nomin with far fewer deleg __PUNCT__
we have a close __PUNCT__ close race here __PUNCT__
and it is a matter of inch __PUNCT__
and we go to keep go until someon get __NUM__ deleg __PUNCT__
that the wai our system work __PUNCT__
blitzer __PUNCT__ john edward ha sai he give you a lot of credit for be will to stick __PUNCT__ stick in there and fight it out __PUNCT__
he __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ drop out __PUNCT__
and i guess the question is __PUNCT__ how do you do it everi singl dai __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ wolf __PUNCT__ someth happen everi singl dai that just lift my spirit and energ me __PUNCT__
a lot of the peopl who have work their heart out for me in thi primari season __PUNCT__ thei not quitter in their own live __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ the singl mom in indianapoli who never given monei to anybodi and give me __MONEY__ a month out of her paycheck __PUNCT__ and goe to my headquart everi lunch hour to work for me __PUNCT__ or the littl boi who sell hi bicycl from kentucki __PUNCT__ or the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old woman dy in a hospic in south dakota who just demand that her daughter bring her an absente ballot __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ these ar peopl who i feel like i repres and that i have a __PUNCT__ a veri person connect to __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i don't believ in quit __PUNCT__
you mai not win in life __PUNCT__ but you do the best you can __PUNCT__
you go the distanc __PUNCT__
you don't walk off the court befor the buzzer sound __PUNCT__
you never know __PUNCT__
you might get a three __PUNCT__ point shot at the end __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ we go to __PUNCT__ we go to finish thi process __PUNCT__
it been a privileg and an honor to have met so mani american __PUNCT__ been to so mani of the beauti place in thi countri __PUNCT__
and i feel like i do it for the right reason __PUNCT__
