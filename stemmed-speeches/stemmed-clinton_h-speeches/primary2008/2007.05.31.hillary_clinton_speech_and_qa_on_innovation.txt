it is a real pleasur for me to be here __PUNCT__ speak to the silicon vallei leadership group __PUNCT__ which i understand ha been around for nearli __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
it is hard to believ that __NUM__ year have pass but it is clear that those __NUM__ year revolution our countri and our world __PUNCT__
and i am grate for the contribut that all of you have made to that revolut __PUNCT__
you know it as well as anyon __PUNCT__ the benefit that spring from global __PUNCT__
it ha lift more peopl out of poverti around the world than probabl ani other advanc in recent histori __PUNCT__
it ha certainli help expand our prosper here at home in mani import wai __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ it is inevit __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ there is no escap thi and what we have to do in america todai is figur out how to best har the forc of global to ensur a continu qualiti of life and standard of live __PUNCT__
but i have to tell you __PUNCT__ here in the silicon vallei __PUNCT__ base on the work that i have done for mani year __PUNCT__ and in particular as a senat from new york for the past six and a half year __PUNCT__ and now as a candid for presid __PUNCT__ there is a deep sens of anxieti in america __PUNCT__
it is an anxieti that is root in the realiti that for mani american __PUNCT__ thei have seen their wage stagnat __PUNCT__
thei have seen the price of everyth els that thei need in life __PUNCT__ health care to colleg tuition to the price of ga at the pump __PUNCT__ continu to go up __PUNCT__
and thei believ that somehow thei ar not get ahead __PUNCT__ despit the fact that mani of us here __PUNCT__ and million of other of us around our countri ar __PUNCT__
i think that the fear that our prosper will not be share ha veri seriou consequ for not onli our economi but for our societi and for our polit __PUNCT__
and certainli the polici of the last six year have done littl to assuag the fear that peopl feel __PUNCT__
over the past six year __PUNCT__ while product ha gone up __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ averag famili incom ha gone down __NUM__ dollar __PUNCT__
the result is a pessimist view that america can't win in the global economi unless the middl class lose __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i believ we ought to hit the restart button on the __NUM__ centuri becaus america not onli can but must succe in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and it time for a thoroughli modern and optimist __PUNCT__ progress vision for how we do that __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i given a seri of speech outlin what i believ that vision should be __PUNCT__
i talk about reform our govern so it work for the vast major of american __PUNCT__
i outlin a seri of step to ensur that prosper is share and that equal opportun is real __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ i want to discuss polici that i believ would help us promot innov and step to spread the benefit of that innov throughout america __PUNCT__
that mean dedic more resourc to area like altern energi and basic research and involv more peopl in the innov economi __PUNCT__
there is no doubt in my mind that american ingenu is the kei to greater prosper in the face of global competit __PUNCT__
that what set us apart in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and combin with the right polici to creat opportun for all __PUNCT__ it will set us apart in thi centuri __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ while other nation have march ahead __PUNCT__ we been march sidewai __PUNCT__
over the past twelv year __PUNCT__ while american invest in research and develop ha remain rel static __PUNCT__ china ha doubl the share of it nation wealth invest in r&d __PUNCT__
the european union ha set a goal of increas r&d invest by member state to __NUM__ percent of gdp by __NUM__ nearli match us __PUNCT__
the educ pipelin __PUNCT__ the sourc of futur innov __PUNCT__ reveal the same trend __PUNCT__
between __NUM__ and __NUM__ as mani as of you know too well __PUNCT__ america global share of phd in scienc and engin declin from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
that rate is expect to drop to __NUM__ percent in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
too few of our colleg student ar studi the stem subject __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ engin __PUNCT__ and math __PUNCT__
our innov infrastructur is fall behind __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
we drop consider in our broadband deploy __PUNCT__
depend on which survei you look at __PUNCT__ it go to be __NUM__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the bottom line is it is not good new for what we try to achiev __PUNCT__
now in thi debat about how to move forward __PUNCT__ too often polici maker will wall themselv off into two compet camp __PUNCT__
there ar those who sai there is noth to worri about and other who sai there is noth we can do __PUNCT__
i have familiar with both camp __PUNCT__ and i believ both ar wrong __PUNCT__
for those who sai there is noth to worri about __PUNCT__ i think that their rosi scenario ar doom to failur and thei will be unfortun proven wrong __PUNCT__
but at what cost __PUNCT__ and for those who sai that just the wai the rest of the world work and we can't realli do anyth about thi __PUNCT__ i think that a streak of fatal that i find profoundli un __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__
america remain the preemin destin for discoveri __PUNCT__ but our global leadership and vision did not happen by accid __PUNCT__
it took smart __PUNCT__ forward think polici that us what wa right about america to make america stronger __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ global competit is a challeng __PUNCT__ but it is also an opportun to lead the world in new field like nanotechnolog __PUNCT__ while lift up our standard of live and open up new market to american product __PUNCT__
energi depend is the greatest innov challeng that america ha face in gener __PUNCT__
it is also an unparallel opportun to start new green industri and reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
climat chang is a major threat __PUNCT__ but if we act to address it rather than ignor it __PUNCT__ we could move toward new renew energi and creat million of new job here in america __PUNCT__
i mean just think about it __PUNCT__ america wa built on innov __PUNCT__
on of my favorit exampl is presid lincoln __PUNCT__ in the middl of the civil war __PUNCT__ a war that no on could predict that he would win and keep the union togeth __PUNCT__ decid to give the go ahead for two major nation endeavor __PUNCT__ on to complet the intern __PUNCT__ in the sens of cross __PUNCT__ nation __PUNCT__ railroad __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ to be abl to go to from on coast to the other __PUNCT__
the second wa start a system of land __PUNCT__ grant colleg __PUNCT__
imagin the optim it took to be sit in the white hous get so mani report of dire outcom in battl across the east coast and to think when thi is over we ar go to need place to educ the next gener __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ we had the same spirit of can __PUNCT__ do progressiv at the turn of the last centuri __PUNCT__ dure the great depress __PUNCT__ there is a highwai system under presid eisenhow __PUNCT__ put highwai where peopl didn't even live yet with the confid that thei soon would __PUNCT__
the space program is a perfect exampl __PUNCT__
and we certainli can point in the privat sector to two gui in a garag name hewlett and packard or a team of research work for the defens depart on a technolog call __PUNCT__ stealth __PUNCT__ and see how the partnership that wa forg __PUNCT__ start in the 1950 and into the 1960 __PUNCT__ had such far reach consequ for both the public and the privat sector __PUNCT__
a cultur that valu and invest in idea is part and parcel of the promis of america __PUNCT__
and we have alwai support that cultur with public invest that accompani our entrepreneuri spirit __PUNCT__ the avail of capit __PUNCT__ and the best univers system in the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what is happen todai is we ar not realiz either the benefit of those earlier invest or keep our ey on the horizon as to how we __PUNCT__ in thi gener __PUNCT__ in thi centuri __PUNCT__ will make our own contribut as a part of america innov agenda __PUNCT__
think about how the first lane of the inform superhighwai were laid by our research __PUNCT__
thei built a new wai of share inform becaus of an insati appetit for data in the pursuit of discoveri __PUNCT__
huge consequenti advanc in logist were pioneer by american compani __PUNCT__
and we know that america mai well be the land of opportun __PUNCT__ but it also the land where peopl keep their ey on opportun cost __PUNCT__
the fire that wa spark here in thi vallei ha made such a differ but it can't just be allow to sputter out __PUNCT__
there ha to be a partnership again between our govern and our great compani and the entrepreneur who yet have not discov what it is that will revolution the wai we live todai __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ what ar we to do and how do we do it __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ todai i propos a nine __PUNCT__ point agenda to renew the promis of america __PUNCT__ creat good job __PUNCT__ and bolster our capac to innov __PUNCT__
invest in altern energi and basic research __PUNCT__
strengthen our scienc __PUNCT__ engin __PUNCT__ and mathemat workforc __PUNCT__
reinforc our innov infrastructur through broadband with better incent for research and develop __PUNCT__
restor scientif integr in washington __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i propos a nation commit to solv the energi and global warm challeng __PUNCT__
a __MONEY__ billion strateg energi fund __PUNCT__ paid for in part by close the tax subsidi and loophol that the oil compani still enjoi __PUNCT__
it almost imposs to imagin we ar still subsid compani that have made the largest profit in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i do think there is a role for subsidi __PUNCT__ and i get to that in a minut __PUNCT__ but for matur compani in matur market __PUNCT__ that ha to be carefulli consid __PUNCT__
thi fund would invest in technolog avail right now __PUNCT__ to promot conserv and combat global warm __PUNCT__ end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
the fund creat an energi initi model on darpa __PUNCT__ the defens advanc research project agenc __PUNCT__
we bring togeth __PUNCT__ as we onc did in darpa __PUNCT__ the best mind in the public and privat sector to think outsid the proverbi box __PUNCT__
to do high risk __PUNCT__ high reward research we can't even predict what the benefit will be __PUNCT__
i know that the silicon vallei leadership group ha just put forth a __NUM__ point campaign with an agenda call __PUNCT__ clean and green __PUNCT__ and i just receiv a copi of that and i look forward to look at it __PUNCT__
but win the __NUM__ centuri energi race is as import and as potenti product and profit as win the __NUM__ centuri space race __PUNCT__
we can safeguard our environ __PUNCT__ grow the economi __PUNCT__ protect our secur __PUNCT__ and creat million of good new job __PUNCT__
i think that if you look at the experi of other countri __PUNCT__ you can certainli see the econom impact of thi __PUNCT__
unit kingdom sign kyoto when we didn't __PUNCT__
and not onli did thei meet their earliest kyoto target to reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ but thei creat thousand of job __PUNCT__ thei kept unemploy low __PUNCT__ and wage increas __PUNCT__
instead of lead the world in oil import __PUNCT__ america can lead in green technolog export __PUNCT__
i know that thi organ is hold a seri of event on thi __PUNCT__ and that appli materi is do innov work with solar technolog __PUNCT__
i believ __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ that in the absenc of a nation effort __PUNCT__ model on the apollo project for exampl __PUNCT__ it will be veri difficult to bring to scale and commerci the chang that we need and that we can produc with the proper incent __PUNCT__
the countri that split the atom can end our depend on foreign oil and launch an energi revolut __PUNCT__
we can call it energi __NUM__ __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will increas support for basic and appli research by increas the research budget at the nation scienc foundat __PUNCT__ the depart of energi offic of scienc __PUNCT__ and the depart of defens __PUNCT__
we boost fund by __NUM__ percent over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ with a greater emphasi on high __PUNCT__ risk __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ return invest __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ under the bush administr __PUNCT__ spend on basic and appli research ha declin in real term four year in a row __PUNCT__
darpa __PUNCT__ where basic research led to the precursor of the internet __PUNCT__ the comput mous __PUNCT__ and so much more __PUNCT__ is put less of it resourc into truli revolutionari research __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ darpa is becom much more problem __PUNCT__ solv orient __PUNCT__ and there is a reason for that __PUNCT__
when you look at how difficult it is to combat the improvis explos devic in iraq __PUNCT__ it understand that peopl would be put on overtim to try to figur out how to jam the signal __PUNCT__ how to do anyth to prevent them from explod or be place in the first place __PUNCT__
why is it an either __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ and why don't we continu to fund what we need to for our militari and their protect for both defens and offens purpos __PUNCT__ and put the monei in that we need to continu the kind of cut edg research that ha produc such great result __PUNCT__ often invest in basic research take decad to pai off __PUNCT__ as so mani of you know __PUNCT__ or thei don't pai off at all __PUNCT__
that why the privat sector devot onli __NUM__ percent of all it resourc to basic research __PUNCT__
but when thi type of work lead to big breakthrough __PUNCT__ appli research __PUNCT__ and eventu to new tool and product __PUNCT__ the entir economi benefit __PUNCT__
and i think govern can work in partnership with the privat sector by take the lead in fund these kind of __PUNCT__ blue sky __PUNCT__ endeavor __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i propos we increas the nation institut of health budget by __NUM__ percent over five year with the goal of doubl it over the next decad __PUNCT__
what is happen with nih is particularli troubl __PUNCT__
we know that nih fund research have produc breakthrough and treatment for heart diseas __PUNCT__ cancer __PUNCT__ aid and so much els __PUNCT__
the nih budget wa doubl between __NUM__ and __NUM__ and univers and research had high hope for continu fund and we truli ar on the brink of so mani import breakthrough __PUNCT__
in the year sinc __PUNCT__ the rug ha been pull out from underneath a lot of our best mind __PUNCT__
the presid budget for __NUM__ actual cut fund __PUNCT__
the consequ of unpredict and declin resourc ar halt construct on new laboratori __PUNCT__ fewer grant for research __PUNCT__ uncertainti in current project __PUNCT__ and less support for creativ __PUNCT__ outsid __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ box idea be investig by younger research __PUNCT__
nobel prize win biochemist roger kornberg recent said __PUNCT__ in the present climat especi __PUNCT__ the fund decis ar ultraconserv __PUNCT__
if the work that you propos to do isn't virtual certain of success __PUNCT__ then it won't be fund __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ the kind of work that we would most like to see take place __PUNCT__ which is groundbreak and innov __PUNCT__ li at the other extrem __PUNCT__
america ha led the world in biotech research but we cannot rest on our laurel __PUNCT__
singapor is invest massiv in biotech __PUNCT__
european commun aren't stand still __PUNCT__
invest in nih will not onli help lead to cure __PUNCT__ but will grow the economi __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ i am propos renew commit to multidisciplinari research __PUNCT__ such as a combin of biotechnolog __PUNCT__ inform technolog __PUNCT__ nanotechnolog __PUNCT__ a greater emphasi on public __PUNCT__ privat partnership __PUNCT__ and new effort to promot collabor and off __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ grid idea __PUNCT__
here is an area where america ha a uniqu __PUNCT__ built __PUNCT__ in competit advantag __PUNCT__
no other nation lai claim to the depth and breadth of excel across differ scientif and technolog field than we do __PUNCT__
by bridg area of expertis __PUNCT__ we can bridg gap in our understand __PUNCT__
and as well you know __PUNCT__ sometim the best answer involv approach an old question in a new wai __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ we should increas invest in non __PUNCT__ health applic of bio __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__
nih fund effort domin life scienc research but few program explor non __PUNCT__ health applic __PUNCT__ such as bacteria that could dramat reduc the cost of clean up superfund site __PUNCT__
anoth import step we must take is in health inform technolog __PUNCT__
bring the effici of the inform ag to medic care __PUNCT__ through electron medic record __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ can save monei __PUNCT__ save live __PUNCT__ and prevent mistak __PUNCT__
i have been work on thi for more than four year __PUNCT__ i start with former senat frist in a bipartisan effort to creat a framework for health inform technolog __PUNCT__
we final got it through the senat __PUNCT__ but it di in the hous __PUNCT__
we go to try to bring it back and get thi done onc and for all __PUNCT__
and i know some of the compani repres here have been veri help in think through the architectur of a health it system for our countri __PUNCT__
we should invest in e __PUNCT__ scienc to acceler the pace of discoveri __PUNCT__
you know as well as anyon __PUNCT__ inform is onli as us as the mean of put it in us hand __PUNCT__
billion and billion of data point ar wait in laptop and flash drive and paper file __PUNCT__ wait to becom the next great medic discoveri or understand of how to stem global warm __PUNCT__
by invest in new tool to help scientist collabor __PUNCT__ process inform __PUNCT__ and share data __PUNCT__ we can unleash a wave of discoveri and benefit to our societi __PUNCT__
promot these new collabor between univers and industri is also essenti __PUNCT__
we have to fill the gap left by the declin in great privat sector research institut like bell lab __PUNCT__ which produc technolog like the laser and mani world __PUNCT__ renown scientist __PUNCT__
on other idea __PUNCT__ let us competit prize to encourag innov __PUNCT__
we got all these realiti show about sing and model and hair style __PUNCT__ and you name it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let do some realiti show about innov __PUNCT__ and let have some cash prize out there to get young peopl to start think that wai __PUNCT__
i long said that if we could have some realli good program about math student and engin that would get peopl excit __PUNCT__
we have so mani kid who now want to go into forens becaus thei seen it on tv __PUNCT__
if we propos prize to be part of our budget at our research agenc __PUNCT__ we could seek out new idea from unexpect place __PUNCT__
we ought to try to construct build that us onsit renew energi technolog __PUNCT__
i hold a contest to pick campaign theme song __PUNCT__ and my campaign got idea we never would thought of from veri unusu sourc __PUNCT__ look at youtub and you can see that for sure __PUNCT__
while invest in idea and research __PUNCT__ we should also invest in skill and educ __PUNCT__
thi ha becom almost a cliché __PUNCT__ hasn't it __PUNCT__ and i have had countless meet with peopl from the silicon vallei and in silicon vallei bemoan the shortag in the skill that ar need __PUNCT__
but i hear that across the countri __PUNCT__
there ar auto mechan job we cannot fill todai __PUNCT__
thousand of them __PUNCT__ make __NUM__ thousand dollar __PUNCT__
there ar airlin mechan job that we can't fill __PUNCT__ there ar so mani job that we can't get the right mix between the person and the skill and the job __PUNCT__
we need a much better approach to do thi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ with respect specif to innov __PUNCT__ i propos tripl the number of nsf fellowship __PUNCT__ and increas the size of each award __PUNCT__
we need to treat our young scientist and engin with respect and provid real reward __PUNCT__
thei should know that our countri need them __PUNCT__ becaus in fact we do __PUNCT__
i talk to mani peopl who went into math __PUNCT__ or physic __PUNCT__ or chemistri after sputnik and the space program which peak their interest __PUNCT__
thei all reach retir ag __PUNCT__
you think there a skill shortag now __PUNCT__ project it out a decad and we go to be in real troubl if we don't figur out how to get the pipelin built __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ light bulb moment requir electr __PUNCT__
and educ is the ultim innov prerequisit __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ here again we ar cede ground to other nation __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the undergradu in china ar earn degre in scienc and engin __PUNCT__ in america the rate is __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the u. __PUNCT__ institut nation scienc foundat fellowship in respons to the soviet union and the space race __PUNCT__
in the decad sinc the number of grant is larg unchang __PUNCT__ despit a three __PUNCT__ fold increas in the number of colleg student graduat with scienc and engin degre __PUNCT__
so we face differ challeng __PUNCT__ but we need a similar commit __PUNCT__
i co __PUNCT__ sponsor the america compet act __PUNCT__ which recent pass the senat __PUNCT__ to increas the advanc class for high school student in math and scienc __PUNCT__ and to put more peopl in the scientif and engin pipelin __PUNCT__
we have to act now to improv educ and research in scienc __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ engin __PUNCT__ and mathemat in order to retain our leadership __PUNCT__
and we got to start us new idea __PUNCT__
my husband recent spoke at a school that he and i start in arkansa __PUNCT__ the arkansa math and scienc high school __PUNCT__
and it wa start becaus there ar a lot of young peopl around the state who care about math and scienc __PUNCT__ but their high school couldn't offer a veri challeng curriculum __PUNCT__
it a board school and kid come from all over __PUNCT__ and thei come mostli from small town __PUNCT__
there were onli __PUNCT__ i recal __PUNCT__ mayb __NUM__ graduat __PUNCT__ and thei brought in __MONEY__ million worth of scholarship becaus in that environ __PUNCT__ which wa self __PUNCT__ select and which drove a realli high standard __PUNCT__ thei respond __PUNCT__
so i think we should do even more to think about how we ar go to find these skill __PUNCT__
it mai be that we need more of these public board school __PUNCT__
let think about how we realli make math __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ engin and technolog attract __PUNCT__
two of my propos were includ in the bill that pass __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i would creat new fellowship at the nsf to allow math and scienc profession to becom teacher in high __PUNCT__ need school __PUNCT__ and to train current math teacher with expertis to becom mentor and profession __PUNCT__
these ar model on two success program in new york __PUNCT__
i also includ a studi to be conduct by the nation academi of scienc to investig promis practic in math and scienc educ __PUNCT__
we obvious need to do a better job of reproduc educ excel and we need to have nation standard in math and scienc educ __PUNCT__
there not a differ in algebra across state line and we act as though there is __PUNCT__ and it time to sai enough __PUNCT__
we need nation standard __PUNCT__ at least __PUNCT__ in math and scienc __PUNCT__
sixth __PUNCT__ we have to open the door of scienc and engin to more peopl __PUNCT__ especi women and minor __PUNCT__
we done a great job bring the best and brightest from around the world but we have to do more to get women and minor to be involv __PUNCT__ and as presid i will try to promot that __PUNCT__ to tap new sourc of talent and to set exampl by have a greater public awar of what await __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ on of my favorit peopl is the presid of rpi in new york who previous wa the head of the nuclear regulatori commiss __PUNCT__
she the first or the second african american woman to receiv a phd in nuclear physic __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't know if enough peopl know about her and know about what she ha done with her life and how she can __PUNCT__ perhap __PUNCT__ serv as an exampl for other __PUNCT__
so we need to do more and we have to also recogn the shortag that exist now __PUNCT__
so i am reaffirm my commit to the h1b visa and increas the current cap __PUNCT__
let just face the fact that foreign skill worker contribut greatli to what we have to do in be innov __PUNCT__
and certainli that understood well here in silicon vallei where more than a quarter of highli skill profession ar immigr __PUNCT__
but i would hope that we could do more of what i suggest simultan __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ increas the cap __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ try to get green card for those who graduat from our colleg and univers after we train them so thei don't go home __PUNCT__ let try and keep them here __PUNCT__
there a lot we can do to deal with the overreact __PUNCT__ in mani wai __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ 9/11 __PUNCT__ but let also think about what els we go to do here __PUNCT__
on thing that i would offer for your consider is whether it is possibl to creat some kind of continu educ or curriculum that could be avail becaus what i find as i travel around the countri ar engin who come up to me and sai __PUNCT__ i been an engin at thi countri for __NUM__ year or __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and now i be ask to train my successor becaus my job is be outsourc __PUNCT__
what am i suppos to do __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if that engin talent and skill truli ar not market in the current from __PUNCT__ then what can we do to try to make them market __PUNCT__ how can we creat that opportun __PUNCT__ seventh __PUNCT__ as presid i ensur we have a nation commit to broadband __PUNCT__
now we need to invest in our infrastructur and __PUNCT__ what the railroad were to the __NUM__ centuri and electr wa to the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ we know that innov tool like broadband ar essenti to the economi of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
we should not be satisfi with our stand slip year by year __PUNCT__
we ar the birthplac of the internet __PUNCT__ but our broadband infrastructur is stuck in adolesc __PUNCT__
and i propos an agenda to bring the inform ag economi to everi corner of our countri __PUNCT__
it is possibl to do thi __PUNCT__
we need nation leadership __PUNCT__
i introduc broadband propos __PUNCT__ we go to keep work on thi __PUNCT__ but it critic if we go to connect up the countri __PUNCT__
eighth __PUNCT__ i propos overhaul the research and experiment tax credit __PUNCT__
let make it perman __PUNCT__ more effect __PUNCT__ and larger if necessari __PUNCT__
we will not get excit new applic unless we encourag compani to invest in research __PUNCT__ and do it in america __PUNCT__
the r&e tax credit is us by more than __NUM__ compani who might not otherwis put mani dollar into innov idea __PUNCT__
we have fail to make the credit perman __PUNCT__ we alwai renew it year __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__
it need to be made perman not onli for the practic but also as a symbol of what we believ about our futur __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ a cultur that valu innov requir a govern that valu fact __PUNCT__
i am just often struck by how hard thi administr ha tri to turn washington into an evid __PUNCT__ free zone where the fact ar subordin to partisanship and where evid wa disregard in favor of ideolog __PUNCT__
the integr of scienc ha been under assault for six year __PUNCT__ and whether it wa mercuri in our water or carbon dioxid in our atmospher or decis over women health __PUNCT__ ideologu call the shot __PUNCT__
everydai __PUNCT__ here in the vallei __PUNCT__ you make decis base on fact and evid __PUNCT__ not preconceiv notion __PUNCT__
i don't think it too much to ask that our govern doe the same __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i outlin a comprehens govern reform agenda __PUNCT__ and thi wa an import piec __PUNCT__
now wai back in the 1990 __PUNCT__ congress had an offic of technolog assess that wa charg with just on task __PUNCT__ tell us the truth about scienc __PUNCT__ sort out the compet claim __PUNCT__ and to the best of the scientist __PUNCT__ abil __PUNCT__ tell us what to believ __PUNCT__
for decad thei cut through the myth and the spin on everyth from star war to aid prevent to solar technolog __PUNCT__
it time to put thi offic back in busi __PUNCT__ becaus how can we as a democraci make good decis if we either don't have the fact or if thei ar activ withheld from us __PUNCT__ and if we go to reap the benefit of innov __PUNCT__ we have to take everi step to ensur that our trade partner adher to a standard of intellectu properti protect similar to what we have in the unit state __PUNCT__
i know that intellectu properti piraci cost compani million of dollar everi year and that piraci and counterfeit hit our high __PUNCT__ tech compani more than ani other sector in the economi __PUNCT__
so let get back to free and open scientif enquiri and the promis and proven of a free and open societi __PUNCT__ and let also take the step necessari to protect the result of that free and open enquiri __PUNCT__
so do we face big challeng __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
is our economi chang __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
but we done thi befor and i confid we can do it again __PUNCT__
call me an honest optimist or a practic visionari __PUNCT__ whatev __PUNCT__ but i believ thi is all doabl becaus we ar a nation of innov __PUNCT__ and you ar both the beneficiari and the benefactor of that innov cultur __PUNCT__
and it is a cultur of ingenu __PUNCT__ and in it absenc we cannot expect to continu the standard of live and the qualiti of life that have mark our countri __PUNCT__ that have serv as such an inspir rout to the american dream __PUNCT__
we need leadership to get thi done __PUNCT__ i believ america is readi for chang __PUNCT__
obvious i offer myself to lead that chang becaus i believ it is on of the most import issu confront us __PUNCT__ and i want to hear your idea and to work with you __PUNCT__
call thi version __NUM__ of my innov agenda __PUNCT__ so after collabor with some of you we perhap tweak it and fine tune it __PUNCT__ but the ultim consequ of thi ha to be leadership that onc again set our sight on the star and give us the tool to get there __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
