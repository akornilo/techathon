everi time we broken ani barrier __PUNCT__ that alwai requir peopl to take a bit of a leap of faith becaus it hasn't basebal done befor __PUNCT__
but i am fulli confid that there ar mani women in our countri who ar equip and readi to lead just as ha happen in other countri around the world __PUNCT__
but i do thi becaus i believ i would be the best candid and the best presid __PUNCT__
i not look for peopl who sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i go to vote for her just becaus she a woman __PUNCT__
but i do think it import that we try to demonstr that women ar fulli capabl of serv at the highest level in our govern __PUNCT__ and obvious __PUNCT__ i go to be ask peopl to give me the honor of that __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from carolyn in new york __PUNCT__
carolyn ask __PUNCT__ where do you stand on the iraq war __PUNCT__ know what you know todai __PUNCT__ do you regret your vote of endors to go into iraq in the first place __PUNCT__ i would love to support you __PUNCT__ but these issu ar veri import to me and mani other __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei veri import to me as well __PUNCT__
there noth more import __PUNCT__ and you know __PUNCT__ ever sinc i becam a senat from new york __PUNCT__ your state and mine __PUNCT__ i have worri about 9/11 and terror and afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__
i have said mani time that __PUNCT__ if we had known then __PUNCT__ when the presid came to the congress to ask for author to pursu what he said would be an effort to contain saddam hussein and put inspector in to make sure that he didn't have weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ if we had known everyth that we now know __PUNCT__ the presid would never have ask for such author __PUNCT__ and the congress would never have vote to give it to him __PUNCT__
and i certainli would not have vote to do so __PUNCT__
but all these year later __PUNCT__ we ar face with a veri danger situat __PUNCT__ and what i tri to focu on __PUNCT__ start __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ shortli after the invas __PUNCT__ when i began point out the problem saw and rais question about the polici that wa be pursu from my posit on the arm arm servic committe __PUNCT__ we have to make better decis now than thi presid wa made in the past __PUNCT__
that why i went again __PUNCT__ my third trip to afghanistan and iraq last weekend __PUNCT__ and i tri to make my own assess __PUNCT__
and when i return __PUNCT__ i reaffirm my opposit to the presid strategi of escal __PUNCT__ put march american troop into baghdad __PUNCT__ into iraq __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ i think we should cap the number of troop __PUNCT__ and we should begin to put real condit on the iraqi govern __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i don't want to cut monei for american troop __PUNCT__
i been to too mani event and place like our militari hospit in germani __PUNCT__ where i stop on the wai back __PUNCT__ where i met with our wound servicemen and women __PUNCT__
i don't want to do anyth that in ani wai undercut their abil to protect themselv and to do what thei need to do in the combat arena where thei ar be place __PUNCT__
but i do think we should threaten to cut the fund for the iraqi armi and the iraqi polic forc and the secur for the iraqi leader __PUNCT__ which we pai for __PUNCT__ unless thei make some of the decis that we been expect them to make for a number of year __PUNCT__
i don't understand why thi presid ha given them such a blank check __PUNCT__ and i think we need to make clear there is no open __PUNCT__ end commit __PUNCT__
we need a phase redeploy of our troop __PUNCT__
we need to try to bring them home as safe and as soon as it is possibl __PUNCT__
but let me add that america doe have some remain veri vital secur interest __PUNCT__
the al qaeda in iraq __PUNCT__ thei weren't there befor __PUNCT__ thei ar there now __PUNCT__
thei pose a threat not onli to our troop in iraq but to our friend in the region and even to us here at home __PUNCT__
we have to make sure we do everyth we can to try to prevent them from us their horrend terrorist tactic against american and against other innoc peopl __PUNCT__
we also need to try to prevent iran from expand it influenc in iraq and in the region __PUNCT__
and prevent it continu effort to obtain a nuclear weapon which would be so danger not onli to the region but also to israel and our countri and realli to the stabil of the world __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i would certainli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ wish that we didn't have the situat we face now __PUNCT__ but i go to continu to do what i can to try to be as respons as possibl to get our troop home but also to deal with the danger that have been unleash there __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from kim in winston __PUNCT__ salem __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ how doe new orlean rank on your list of prioriti __PUNCT__ and what ar your plan for bring new orlean and the gulf coast back __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ it rank veri high __PUNCT__
i spent mani year have a wonder life in arkansa __PUNCT__ and my husband and i us to go to new orlean __PUNCT__
and so i walk those street __PUNCT__
i have had mani friend who have live and work in new orlean __PUNCT__
when i went down to visit after the horror of katrina and rita __PUNCT__ i wa just heartbroken to see the devast __PUNCT__
i don't believ that thi presid and our govern have respond as i would want them to __PUNCT__
thei have not put in the effort __PUNCT__ the monei __PUNCT__ the attent __PUNCT__ and focu that the peopl in new orlean and in the surround parish and along the gulf coast deserv __PUNCT__
so thi is a high prioriti for me __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ it realli unimagin that our countri would turn it back on the peopl who suffer so much __PUNCT__
these ar our fellow american __PUNCT__
mani of them don't feel thei can even go back home __PUNCT__ and i meet peopl all the time who thei themselv and their famili ar still disloc __PUNCT__
it tragic that we had such a poorli organ half __PUNCT__ heart respons continu to thi dai to fail the peopl in the gulf coast area __PUNCT__
so i go to do everyth i can __PUNCT__ first from my posit as senat __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__ as your presid __PUNCT__ to try to make good to the peopl who have unfortun been so disappoint and let down __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from matti in new york __PUNCT__
matti sai __PUNCT__ i am a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old class presid from armonk __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__
i have an interest in polit and on dai aspir to be presid __PUNCT__

there no guid book for someon who want to go into polit life __PUNCT__
i didn't think i ever person run for offic __PUNCT__ but i alwai work in campaign and believ strongli in do my part to help our democraci work __PUNCT__
i guess my advic would be do what you love __PUNCT__
do what realli make you happi __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ when i wa grow up __PUNCT__ i want to help peopl __PUNCT__
i particularli want to help children when i wa in colleg and then in law school __PUNCT__ i spent a lot of time studi about the best wai to help kid __PUNCT__
and then i did __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ work when i wa in law school with children who were abus and neglect and tri to think of wai that i could be of help __PUNCT__
and i work for the children defens fund __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ through that __PUNCT__ i realli wa expos to a lot of the problem that i frankli didn't see when i wa grow up __PUNCT__
i had a veri nice middl class upbring in a suburb of chicago __PUNCT__
and i think __PUNCT__ if you can get out and learn more about the world and volunt to help peopl __PUNCT__
i did that through my church when i wa grow up __PUNCT__
and ani wai that you can expand your horizon becaus everi on of us is somewhat limit by the famili we born into and the experi we have and where we go to school __PUNCT__
and i think todai __PUNCT__ more than ever __PUNCT__ we need young peopl like yourself who realli go to learn about the world and understand what you can do to make a contribut __PUNCT__
and i would also just realli recommend just studi what you interest in __PUNCT__ learn as much as you can __PUNCT__ and volunt in campaign __PUNCT__

i wish you a lot of luck with your life as you go forward __PUNCT__
and just keep dream big dream becaus we need young peopl who care a lot about what go to happen in the futur __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our next question is from debra in upper sanduski __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
i am a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old singl femal __PUNCT__
i been a hair dresser for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i cannot afford to think about pai ani kind of health coverag __PUNCT__
what would you do as presid about thi seriou problem __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ debra __PUNCT__ i hear about that from so mani peopl __PUNCT__ particularli peopl like yourself who ar self __PUNCT__ emploi __PUNCT__ work for small employ who don't offer health insur __PUNCT__
i remain commit to provid qualiti afford health care for everi american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some peopl might sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ didn't you try that befor __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i work at my husband request to try to see if we could do what wa necessari to creat a system that everybodi could be part of __PUNCT__
and we were not success __PUNCT__ and we made a bunch of mistak __PUNCT__ and i learn from all of that __PUNCT__
and i have the scar to show what we went through __PUNCT__
and back then __PUNCT__ i not sure that enough peopl realli accept the fact that what we alwai had wa just no longer go to be success in a new global economi where our busi ar compet with compani and countri that don't have to provid health insur or where everybodi ha to offer it so that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ everybodi in it togeth __PUNCT__
so i determin to work toward thi __PUNCT__
but what i been encourag about __PUNCT__ debra __PUNCT__ is that for the first time in the last sever month __PUNCT__ peopl ar realli focus on thi __PUNCT__
we got busi talk with labor union __PUNCT__ talk __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ with commun peopl __PUNCT__ talk with doctor and nurs and hospit __PUNCT__
and everybodi come togeth __PUNCT__
all level of busi __PUNCT__ all level of govern __PUNCT__
and so i veri encourag that we go to do what american do best when we final roll up our sleev and sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we got a problem __PUNCT__
it a problem of cost becaus __PUNCT__ as you sai __PUNCT__ it too expens __PUNCT__
it a problem of competit becaus we ar lose job in america __PUNCT__ becaus we haven't figur out how to make qualiti health care afford and avail to everyon __PUNCT__
and it also a question of will __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ polit will __PUNCT__
ar we go to roll up our sleev and do thi __PUNCT__ and i think we will __PUNCT__
so i sure go to be campaign about it around the countri __PUNCT__
i go to be ask peopl in these convers to give me their idea __PUNCT__ what thei think would work __PUNCT__ and i sure hope that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ you go to be abl to have afford health care __PUNCT__
on of my idea that specif would affect someon in your ag categori __PUNCT__ which is my ag categori __PUNCT__ is to let peopl who don't have insur between __NUM__ and __NUM__ bui into medicar __PUNCT__
that on idea that we had float around that we could look at __PUNCT__
or bui into the feder employe health benefit plan __PUNCT__ which is what take care of senat like me __PUNCT__
so a lot of good idea __PUNCT__ but i determin that we go to come up with a better system so that i don't have to hear the stori that i hear about peopl who ar realli left out __PUNCT__ bankrupt __PUNCT__ deni medic care when thei need it most __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ timothi from honolulu sai __PUNCT__ we alwai admir the great job bill and you did in shield chelsea from life in a fish bowl __PUNCT__ and in the process rais her to be such an intellig and well pois ladi __PUNCT__
we were wonder __PUNCT__ now that she an adult accomplish in her own right __PUNCT__ do you expect she be take a more activ and visibl role in your upcom campaign than she ha in previou campaign __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ on of the thing about rais an independ son or daughter __PUNCT__ in my case __PUNCT__ is you want them to do what right for them __PUNCT__ and that will be up to her __PUNCT__
what i appreci is the fact that be in public life ha a lot of great benefit and privileg __PUNCT__ but the famili of peopl in public life have __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ unfortun been put in that fish bowl __PUNCT__ as you sai __PUNCT__
and what i tri to do and what i admir about other peopl __PUNCT__ includ our presid current in the white hous and other __PUNCT__ is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we shouldn't be expos our children and other rel __PUNCT__
that not __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ part of the polit process that we realli need to do __PUNCT__
so i appreci what you said __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ i turn to her for advic and support in everi wai __PUNCT__ and i will continu to do so __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ michael from new rochel __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__ what ar you go to do to specif battl terror and keep the unit state safe __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ new rochel is anoth neighbor of mine __PUNCT__
we both outsid of new york citi __PUNCT__
as you know live in new rochel __PUNCT__ we went through such a horribl time after 9/11 __PUNCT__
everi on of us in the greater new york area knew somebodi who wa affect __PUNCT__
that give us perhap a keener awar of the danger we face __PUNCT__
sometim it can seem like 9/11 wa a long time ago or a veri long wai awai __PUNCT__
when i travel around the countri and talk to peopl who weren't there __PUNCT__ weren't affect __PUNCT__
but just thi morn __PUNCT__ i wa at ground zero with victim who had been afflict by the toxic dust that wa releas becaus of the collaps of the world trade center build __PUNCT__
we have peopl dy __PUNCT__
we have peopl unabl to breath __PUNCT__
we have a retir nypd offic fight for hi life in on of our hospit right now __PUNCT__
hi son is go to be my guest at the state of the union tomorrow night __PUNCT__
so 9/11 and the threat of terror is never veri far awai from my mind __PUNCT__
and i intend to do everyth i can for us to remain vigil and prepar __PUNCT__
we made some progress in the last year sinc 9/11 __PUNCT__ but not nearli enough __PUNCT__
our system is not as focus on the threat we face as i would like it to be __PUNCT__
and i want to continu to advoc for more resourc and better fund and more personnel to protect our border __PUNCT__ our port __PUNCT__ our mass transit system __PUNCT__
we done a good job on passeng aircraft but not as good a job on all of the materi __PUNCT__ the freight that is ship by air __PUNCT__
we need to be vigil about who come in and out of our countri __PUNCT__
we try to stop terror wherev we can beyond our border by have better cooper with peopl around the world __PUNCT__
so thi is a primari goal of mine __PUNCT__ to make sure that we ar as well prepar as possibl __PUNCT__
i can't sit here tonight and tell you that there will never be anoth attack although i prai there will not be __PUNCT__
but we want to know that we done everyth we can to prevent that from ever happen to anyon again __PUNCT__
the scar of 9/11 and the live of the peopl that i serv and repres in new york ar still present everi singl dai __PUNCT__ and it remain __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ my primari oblig to make sure that we take care of those who were affect and their famili and do everyth i can to prevent that from happen anywher in our countri again __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ linda from pensacola __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__ do you plan to end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ linda __PUNCT__ i do __PUNCT__
it probabl longer and more wonkish than i can tell you in a brief web chat __PUNCT__ but just briefli __PUNCT__ let me sai that i put on my web site a lot of the legisl that i champion and my plan for how we decreas our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ thi is a secur issu as well as a job issu __PUNCT__
securitywis __PUNCT__ we know that __PUNCT__ if we don't move awai from our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ we ar liter over the barrel __PUNCT__
from peopl who do not wish us well and not just in the middl east and not just place like iran __PUNCT__ but venezuela __PUNCT__
and we also at the merci of veri unstabl regim than other part of the world __PUNCT__
so i don't think there a higher secur prioriti __PUNCT__ and the previou question about terror goe hand in hand becaus we can better deal with the terrorist threat we face if we ar not fund them through all kind of mean where thei get monei that liter come out of our pocket becaus we ar so depend upon the natur resourc that thei have in abund __PUNCT__
so we also __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ need to look at thi as a job issu __PUNCT__
we need to creat new and good __PUNCT__ pai job in america __PUNCT__
and altern energi __PUNCT__
what i like to call smart energi __PUNCT__ home __PUNCT__ grown energi __PUNCT__ would be a tremend wai of give a lot of our peopl a better futur __PUNCT__ help them to have a more secur foothold in thi veri competit global economi __PUNCT__
so i think we got to do more to look for altern __PUNCT__
i support all kind of ethanol __PUNCT__
i support look at the solar and geo thermal and certainli try to do more on hydrogen __PUNCT__ which ar longer term goal __PUNCT__
i think we have to do more on conserv and energi effici __PUNCT__
i realli impress with what california ha done over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
becaus thei have impos conserv and energi effici standard __PUNCT__ thei have kept flat their energi us __PUNCT__ and the rest of the countri ha just __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ continu to us more and more energi __PUNCT__
we got to do someth to make our transport system more fuel effici __PUNCT__
and although there ar some who think it __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a difficult problem __PUNCT__ i would like to see us approach the question of how we can us the great coal reserv we have without pollut the environ and ad to global chang __PUNCT__
i ask to take awai the subsidi from big oil and put it into a strateg energi fund that would be us compar to what he did with the manhattan project __PUNCT__ respond to sputnik __PUNCT__ the apollo project __PUNCT__
us the energi fund with a windfal tax on the oil compani take awai their subsidi __PUNCT__ to expedit the creativ geniu of american __PUNCT__
and i wa up at a plant of ge __PUNCT__ their research facil __PUNCT__ which is in upstat new york __PUNCT__ and i saw what we can do if we us our imagin and our know __PUNCT__ how __PUNCT__
and i would also veri much like to see us form an agenc within our govern that put all of thi on a fast track __PUNCT__ that went out to our univers __PUNCT__ our colleg __PUNCT__ our garag where creativ peopl ar think about how to make solar and wind and everyth els much more commerci applic __PUNCT__
let put thi on a fast track __PUNCT__
there no reason we can't do it __PUNCT__
but the feder govern ha to make some invest in order for it to happen __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ jean from new jersei ha a question __PUNCT__ on a lighter note __PUNCT__
what your favorit movi __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ my favorit movi __PUNCT__
i had favorit movi at differ stage in my life __PUNCT__
when i wa veri much younger __PUNCT__ the wizard of oz wa my favorit movi __PUNCT__
i just love imagin myself be there with dorothi and be part of that great adventur that she had __PUNCT__
probabl when i wa in colleg and law school __PUNCT__ casablanca __PUNCT__
i watch it i don't know how mani time __PUNCT__
it alwai wa so much fun __PUNCT__
by the time we watch it over and over again __PUNCT__ we were actual recit the dialogu __PUNCT__
and i suppos in the last year __PUNCT__ out of africa __PUNCT__
i love meryl streep and robert red ford __PUNCT__
those ar three of my favorit movi __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ rachel in austin __PUNCT__ texa __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__ our relat with the intern commun have deterior over the last sever year __PUNCT__
what will you do to mend our relationship with the other countri __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ i think thi is the most import task the next presid will face __PUNCT__ and i intend to tackl it head on __PUNCT__
i have been fortun over the last __NUM__ year to travel wide repres our countri __PUNCT__ to know mani of the leader that ar current run their countri and those who ar come in to power __PUNCT__
we have to send a clear messag that the unit state want to lead the world __PUNCT__ but we want to do it through cooper __PUNCT__ build allianc __PUNCT__ make more friend than enemi __PUNCT__
we cannot kill __PUNCT__ occupi __PUNCT__ jail all of the bad gui who wish us ill __PUNCT__ but we sure can surround them __PUNCT__
we can deter them __PUNCT__
we can defeat them __PUNCT__
if we have peopl root for us __PUNCT__ and what happen in the last six year tragic __PUNCT__ becaus the world wa with us after 9/11 __PUNCT__
thei were there with us __PUNCT__
thei wish us well __PUNCT__
thei want to be part of the fight against the terrorist __PUNCT__
and we have so squander that good will __PUNCT__
and we got to rebuild it __PUNCT__
and that mean start at the top with a presid who will send a messag to the rest of the world that we want to work togeth __PUNCT__
we believ in negoti __PUNCT__ and we want to have diplomat effort __PUNCT__
i don't understand why our current presid won't talk to peopl that he consid bad __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of bad actor in the world __PUNCT__ but i think it a sign of strength __PUNCT__ not weak __PUNCT__ to engag in a process with these peopl becaus __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ you can learn someth __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ on of the first rule of warfar is know your enemi __PUNCT__ and we fly blind becaus we won't sit down and try to figur out what these peopl realli want __PUNCT__ who call the shot __PUNCT__ how we can better deter them __PUNCT__
all dure the cold war __PUNCT__ republican and democrat presid talk to the leader in the soviet union __PUNCT__
after richard nixon break through __PUNCT__ we talk to the leader in china __PUNCT__
now it as though we ar over in on point of the world and look out and point finger and make judgment __PUNCT__
so we don't have the good will __PUNCT__ and we ar not be smart about how we can better solv our problem __PUNCT__
so i agre that we got to have a differ approach __PUNCT__ and i intend to do that not onli through thi campaign by talk about it and put up idea that i think would make a differ __PUNCT__
but as presid __PUNCT__ go out there and make it clear that we want to solv problem togeth __PUNCT__
on last point about thi becaus liter i could talk for the rest of thi web chat __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when presid bush pull out of kyoto __PUNCT__ i thought that wa a mistak __PUNCT__
but an even bigger mistak wa he refus to go into ani other process __PUNCT__
if you don't like what wa negoti at kyoto __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ don't turn your back and pretend that global climat chang isn't real becaus it is __PUNCT__ and it is affect our climat __PUNCT__ and it is go to have an increasingli big impact on how peopl live __PUNCT__
so come up with a differ process __PUNCT__
but don't walk awai from the problem __PUNCT__
just becaus you don't deal with the problem doesn't make the problem go awai __PUNCT__
so on that and on so mani issu __PUNCT__ we need to get back into a dialogu with the rest of the world __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ alexi from anondal __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ ask __PUNCT__ what will you do to insur that middl class american can afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i hear about thi problem all the time __PUNCT__
colleg is increasingli expens __PUNCT__
everybodi know that __PUNCT__
and it veri hard __PUNCT__ with the cost of everyth els go up __PUNCT__ for most middl class famili to afford to save and pai for colleg __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ that mean that __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ a lot of kid don't go who would be colleg materi becaus thei can't afford to start __PUNCT__
a lot of other kid don't finish becaus thei get there and thei can't afford to complet their educ __PUNCT__
and thirdli __PUNCT__ a lot of kid go and tough it out __PUNCT__ often work __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ sometim more than on job __PUNCT__ and thei get out __PUNCT__ and thei have a lot of debt __PUNCT__ which realli hang over them __PUNCT__ make it veri difficult for them to get start with their own live and famili __PUNCT__
so we got to get the cost of colleg down __PUNCT__
we need much more in the wai of colleg aid __PUNCT__
we also need to get back to need base aid becaus a lot of kid who ar realli good prospect for colleg __PUNCT__ thei mai not be the a student __PUNCT__ but thei the solid b student __PUNCT__ or thei the realli hard work c student __PUNCT__
and now we cut so much of the aid that us to be base on need and shift it over to merit that a lot of these kid aren't have a chanc __PUNCT__ and i don't think it smart or fair __PUNCT__
we also need to get the cost of colleg loan down __PUNCT__ cut the interest rate __PUNCT__
we try to do that in the congress now __PUNCT__
but i believ thi is a big problem becaus __PUNCT__ if you actual look at the number __PUNCT__ we haven't done that much to increas the percentag of our kid who actual graduat from colleg __PUNCT__
and in a competit global economi like the on we face todai __PUNCT__ we need to get our best educ kid out there compet __PUNCT__
colleg __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ you don't have to go to colleg to be a good person or to get a good job __PUNCT__ but increasingli a lot of the job ar realli depend upon addit educ __PUNCT__
so i hope that we get the cost down and we enabl mani more peopl to start and to finish without that huge debt load __PUNCT__ which i would like to see much more forgiv to if we could get kid to graduat and then go into public servic job __PUNCT__ take some of the job that we realli need to have fill __PUNCT__
we should be forgiv their debt as well __PUNCT__
crystal patterson __PUNCT__ our final question tonight is from nanci in wisconsin __PUNCT__
nanci sai __PUNCT__ i on of the babi boomer who now look at retir as an imposs dream __PUNCT__
i work hard all my life __PUNCT__ and i discourag __PUNCT__
