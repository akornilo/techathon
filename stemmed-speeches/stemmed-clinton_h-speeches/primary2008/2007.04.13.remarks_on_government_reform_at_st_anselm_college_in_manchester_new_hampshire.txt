it is a tradit that is certainli well __PUNCT__ known far beyond the boundari of thi state __PUNCT__
and i commend the colleg for have such an activ interest and involv in the polit process of our countri and have excel student like melissa who take advantag of those opportun __PUNCT__

and i have alreadi made on hire __PUNCT__ colin pio __PUNCT__ class of __NUM__ even befor he ha graduat to join my campaign __PUNCT__
conting of cours upon receiv hi diploma __PUNCT__
that is the requir for the kind of employ we ar go to be offer __PUNCT__
i here thi afternoon to talk about the import of govern and how we make our govern work for us __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know for some that might be an unusu choic of topic in the __PUNCT__ live free or die __PUNCT__ state __PUNCT__ where the gener feel is __PUNCT__ the less govern __PUNCT__ the better __PUNCT__
but after what i have seen the last six year in washington __PUNCT__ i certainli understand that sentiment __PUNCT__
but what i want to talk about todai ha noth to do with whether our govern is big or small __PUNCT__ and everyth to do with whether it is compet or incompet __PUNCT__ whether it is corrupt or honest __PUNCT__ whether it is devot to the public interest or beholden to the special interest __PUNCT__
despit their rhetor __PUNCT__ for the past six year __PUNCT__ we had an administr that doesn't believ in less govern or smaller govern or better govern __PUNCT__
thei simpli have contempt for govern __PUNCT__
though thei lead it __PUNCT__ thei look down on it __PUNCT__ thei disparag it __PUNCT__ thei belittl it at everi turn __PUNCT__
and becaus thei view our govern with contempt __PUNCT__ thei treat it with contempt __PUNCT__
sinc thei don't believ govern can be a forc for the public interest __PUNCT__ thei treat it as a sourc of favor for privat interest __PUNCT__
thei creat a govern of the few __PUNCT__ by the few __PUNCT__ and for the few __PUNCT__
our presid ha hand out job to hi friend even when thei were not qualifi __PUNCT__
given out no __PUNCT__ bid contract to halliburton __PUNCT__ even after thei overcharg us by hundr of million of dollar __PUNCT__
fire u. __PUNCT__ attornei who tri to uphold the law __PUNCT__
silenc govern scientist who told the truth __PUNCT__
retali against a diplomat who refus to valid fabric evid of wmd in iraq __PUNCT__
realli __PUNCT__ it is a stun record of cronyism and corrupt __PUNCT__ incompet and decept and it ha shaken the faith of mani american in our govern __PUNCT__
when govern consist let us down like thi __PUNCT__ we becom cynic __PUNCT__
we distrust our govern __PUNCT__ and grow to distrust democraci itself __PUNCT__
we decid that polit is distast __PUNCT__ and politician just out for themselv __PUNCT__ so why should we trust our govern with our hope __PUNCT__ dream and ideal __PUNCT__ it realli is a self __PUNCT__ perpetu cycl __PUNCT__
becaus thi administr doesn't respect our govern __PUNCT__ thei run it poorli __PUNCT__ and it fail our peopl __PUNCT__
thei then point to govern failur to prove it not worthi of respect __PUNCT__
and thi just make it harder for us to work on the critic issu that affect peopl live __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ energi independ __PUNCT__ make colleg afford and so much els that peopl throughout new hampshir and america talk to me about __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ our famili ar pai a steep price __PUNCT__
energi cost ar up __PUNCT__
health care cost ar up __PUNCT__
educ cost ar up __PUNCT__
but wage and incom ar lag __PUNCT__
so while american ar work harder than ever __PUNCT__ thei fall further and further behind __PUNCT__ and we see more and more inequ __PUNCT__
it like middl class and hard work famili don't even exist to thi administr __PUNCT__
it like thei invis __PUNCT__
for six long year __PUNCT__ our presid ha look right through them __PUNCT__
if you were a victim of hurrican katrina __PUNCT__ if you on of the nearli __NUM__ peopl still live in trailer __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you a soldier who return from iraq onli to be wareh in crumbl facil at walter reed __PUNCT__ fight to get the treatment you need __PUNCT__ you invis __PUNCT__
if you a parent who can't afford childcar or a student who can't afford colleg __PUNCT__ a famili that can't afford to get by on the minimum wage __PUNCT__ while the wealthiest of us get tax cut __PUNCT__ you invis too __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you not invis to the rest of america __PUNCT__
and you certainli not invis to me __PUNCT__
and when we take back the white hous __PUNCT__ you will no longer be invis to the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we know that govern certainli isn't the answer to all our problem __PUNCT__ that not even close __PUNCT__
but we also know that good govern __PUNCT__ smart govern __PUNCT__ can be a partner for progress __PUNCT__
it can help us solv problem and accomplish thing togeth that we could never accomplish alon __PUNCT__
we seen thi in everyth from the peac corp to americorp __PUNCT__
from cure diseas to build the internet __PUNCT__
from the end of ethnic cleans in kosovo to the end of religi strife in northern ireland __PUNCT__
thi isn't about big govern or small govern __PUNCT__ it should be about smart govern __PUNCT__
and we all know that in order to meet the big challeng of our dai __PUNCT__ to lift up the middl class and hard work famili __PUNCT__ to establish univers health care __PUNCT__ energi independ and fiscal respons __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq and restor our leadership around the world __PUNCT__ we need a govern that is readi to rise to the occas and lead us to our goal __PUNCT__
we need to return to account and a system of check and balanc __PUNCT__ to a congress that onc again exercis oversight and account __PUNCT__
we need a __NUM__ centuri govern to meet our __NUM__ centuri challeng __PUNCT__
but in order to reclaim our govern __PUNCT__ in a democraci after all __PUNCT__ our govern is us __PUNCT__
you know as pogo onc said __PUNCT__ memor __PUNCT__ we met the enemi and it is us __PUNCT__
well our govern is us __PUNCT__
so by denigr our govern we undermin our capac to work togeth to solv these problem __PUNCT__
so we have to chang the wai busi is be done __PUNCT__
and i think we start by look at what we expect from our famili __PUNCT__ our busi __PUNCT__ and our commun __PUNCT__ and then ask ourselv __PUNCT__ why can't our feder govern do that __PUNCT__ you can check your bank account onlin __PUNCT__
why can't you go onlin and see how your govern is spend __PUNCT__ or misspend __PUNCT__ your tax dollar __PUNCT__ you go to the atm __PUNCT__ stick in your card __PUNCT__ and get monei __PUNCT__ why can't our govern transfer medic record from the depart of defens to the va __PUNCT__ you make a budget for your famili __PUNCT__ and you don't spend what you don't have or what you don't need __PUNCT__ why shouldn't our govern do the same with our feder budget __PUNCT__ you trust your doctor to give you honest advic about the medicin you take __PUNCT__ why can't govern scientist do the same when thei regul our food and drug and studi our environ __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i believ our govern can do all these thing __PUNCT__
and that we can be an exampl to ourselv and to the rest of the world __PUNCT__
we can do it in so mani wai __PUNCT__
we can do it by lead through the govern __PUNCT__
we can be the institut support for creat a market for energi effici __PUNCT__
we can creat the architectur for electron medic record __PUNCT__
we can provid inform in a wai that will enabl us to do so much more in a cost effect wai __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i do know that peopl ar cynic about our govern and that sort of the american birthright __PUNCT__
but i believ that with the right leadership we can restor trust and faith in govern __PUNCT__
i believ america is readi for chang __PUNCT__
readi for a new start __PUNCT__
and readi onc again to make thi govern of the peopl __PUNCT__ by the peopl __PUNCT__ and for the peopl __PUNCT__
we can re __PUNCT__ establish the compet of govern __PUNCT__ the confid of citizen in govern __PUNCT__ and the capac of our govern to set goal and achiev them __PUNCT__
todai i want lai out a ten point agenda to do just that __PUNCT__ an agenda for govern reform __PUNCT__
a plan to enhanc account and transpar __PUNCT__
to make govern more effici and effect for taxpay __PUNCT__
to restor compet and end the cultur of cronyism __PUNCT__
to replac secreci and mysteri with open __PUNCT__
a plan to make our govern work for all american again __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to close the revolv door between govern and lobbyist __PUNCT__
thi is exactli what governor lynch did dure hi first term in offic when he creat an independ ethic commiss and requir everi member of hi administr to file public financi disclosur form __PUNCT__
i think we should follow hi lead in washington __PUNCT__ and i start by perman ban ani of my cabinet offici from lobbi my administr onc thei left offic __PUNCT__
we seen the consequ of what happen when we let the revolv door keep turn __PUNCT__
the recent medicar prescript drug bill offer a perfect exampl __PUNCT__
by the time thi bill becam law __PUNCT__ mani of those who help to write it and pass it had left govern to becom lobbyist for compani that sought to benefit from it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the wai i see it __PUNCT__ peopl shouldn't us what thei learn on the taxpay __PUNCT__ dime to enrich themselv at our expens __PUNCT__ and we go to put an end to it __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we go to strengthen whistleblow protect so we can root out corrupt and cronyism __PUNCT__ wherev it mai lie __PUNCT__
over the past six year __PUNCT__ we seen on scandal after anoth at our agenc __PUNCT__ from an offici in the white hous do favor for jack abramoff to an administr at the depart of educ bui stock in the student loan compani he wa suppos to overse __PUNCT__
and while whistleblow plai a critic role in alert us to behavior like thi __PUNCT__ our whistleblow protect law don't give peopl adequ protect __PUNCT__ and too mani ar afraid to step forward __PUNCT__
we seen brave employe who speak up __PUNCT__ strip of their secur clearanc __PUNCT__ pressur into resign __PUNCT__ or outright fire __PUNCT__
take the exampl of jack spadaro __PUNCT__ a mine engin who wa head of the nation mine health and safeti academi __PUNCT__
he blew the whistl on what he felt wa a whitewash by the bush administr of an investig into a major coal slurri spill __PUNCT__
and he wa subsequ forc out of hi job __PUNCT__
there ar hundr of exampl like that __PUNCT__
we need to expand whistleblow protect to ensur that peopl who do the right thing ar reward __PUNCT__ not punish __PUNCT__
that mean protect their anonym __PUNCT__ and protect those who aid them as well __PUNCT__
it mean guarante whistleblow a true dai in court __PUNCT__
it mean make sure those who ar vindic get real relief __PUNCT__ includ compens __PUNCT__ coverag of attornei fee __PUNCT__ and the option to transfer job __PUNCT__
becaus no on should be afraid to hold our govern account __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ i will onc again appoint the most qualifi __PUNCT__ dedic __PUNCT__ public __PUNCT__ mind peopl to serv in govern __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that doesn't mean that i won't appoint peopl who support me __PUNCT__
but what it doe mean is that thi administr could have appoint well __PUNCT__ qualifi republican of independ judgment to posit of trust in our govern __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ thei often simpli appoint their friend and support __PUNCT__ qualifi or not __PUNCT__
a republican partisan whose job at the intern arabian hors associ did not prepar him for a job head fema __PUNCT__
peopl hire for the iraq reconstruct team base on whether thei were pro __PUNCT__ life rather than whether thei spoke arab __PUNCT__
thei hire score of environment __PUNCT__ health and safeti regul who came from the veri industri thei were suppos to overse __PUNCT__
and thei purg the profession staff at the civil right divis in the depart of justic __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the result speak for themselv __PUNCT__
tragic incompet in the gulf coast __PUNCT__
environment standard weaken __PUNCT__
corpor loophol widen __PUNCT__
an industri __PUNCT__ written prescript drug benefit that bar medicar from bargain for lower price __PUNCT__
and a depart of justic that __PUNCT__ between __NUM__ and __NUM__ did not file a singl voter discrimin suit brought by african american or nativ american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we tri to chang thi __PUNCT__
when we were work to improv disast respons after hurrican katrina __PUNCT__ i propos that we requir proper qualif for the director of fema __PUNCT__ someth you would think you wouldn't have to write into the law __PUNCT__
and my propos eventu did becom law __PUNCT__
it wa part of an overal reform packag of fema __PUNCT__
but when the presid sign it __PUNCT__ he specif said that he wasn't go to necessarili follow the direct of have a qualifi person head fema __PUNCT__
he us what is call a sign statement __PUNCT__ to pick and choos from the provis in the law of what he would and would not enforc __PUNCT__
we have to reign in these sign statement __PUNCT__
the presid ha us them to go wai beyond what ani presid befor ha ever done __PUNCT__
and in effect to veto portion of bill that he just doesn't agre with __PUNCT__
well when i presid __PUNCT__ the entranc to the white hous will no longer be a revolv door for just the well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ but a door of opportun for the well __PUNCT__ qualifi __PUNCT__
and in order to attract the best peopl to govern __PUNCT__ i have join on a bi __PUNCT__ partisan basi with some of my colleagu in both the senat and the hous to propos a u. __PUNCT__ public servic academi __PUNCT__ an undergradu school model after our militari servic academi that will cultiv a new gener of leader dedic to public servic __PUNCT__
the academi would provid a four __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ subsid colleg educ in exchang for a five __PUNCT__ year commit to public servic after graduat __PUNCT__
it will help us produc a new gener of law enforc offic __PUNCT__ of civil servant of expert who will dedic themselv to public servic __PUNCT__
we see the retir of so mani peopl who have been do the nut __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ bolt work of the govern for mani year __PUNCT__
and we don't see the pipelin fill with peopl who ar will to take these job __PUNCT__
and yet i know that mani young peopl ar readi __PUNCT__ will and abl to answer the call to serv __PUNCT__
but thei often graduat from colleg with so much debt that thei can't imagin go into a public servic career __PUNCT__
so i hope that the academi will open the door much more wide for young peopl who want to serv their countri __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we go to stop outsourc our govern and put an end to the abus of no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__
over the past six year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha steadili outsourc critic govern function to privat compani __PUNCT__ ad more than __NUM__ million privat contractor to the feder payrol __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ govern contractor have essenti becom yet anoth special interest __PUNCT__ with the top __NUM__ contract firm spend nearli __MONEY__ million sinc __NUM__ to lobbi the govern for more busi to leav the govern and come to them __PUNCT__
but these contractor __PUNCT__ it turn out __PUNCT__ ar often more expens than do the work in the govern __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ some contract employe cost twice as much as compar feder worker __PUNCT__
thei often less account and less compet __PUNCT__
and just think of what happen at walter reed __PUNCT__ when the armi wa forc to outsourc mainten to a privat contract contractor __PUNCT__
the number of peopl do mainten drop dramat __PUNCT__
the contractor cut corner __PUNCT__ fell down on the job __PUNCT__ and our soldier paid the price __PUNCT__
all too often __PUNCT__ thi administr ha hand out govern contract without even shop around for the best price __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ha been an explos in no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ with almost half of the __MONEY__ billion spent on feder contract be done now on a no __PUNCT__ bid basi __PUNCT__
the result is fraud __PUNCT__ wast __PUNCT__ and abus everywher from afghanistan and iraq to the gulf coast __PUNCT__
i propos that we elimin __NUM__ govern contract posit __PUNCT__ save our govern between __MONEY__ and __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
and that we insist on competit bid for the remain contract __PUNCT__ so we get the most valu for everi taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
in the rare case where non __PUNCT__ competit contract might be appropri __PUNCT__ we make sure thei have close oversight __PUNCT__
it seem as thought he motto for the administr ha been __PUNCT__ what a few billion tax dollar between friend __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ the dai of billion in no __PUNCT__ bid contract and handout to compani like halliburton __PUNCT__ that in return for the work given to them pick up corpor headquart and move to dubai __PUNCT__ those dai will be over __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ we go to stop substitut ideolog for scienc and evid __PUNCT__ and we go to start give the american peopl again the fact on the issu that matter to them and their famili __PUNCT__
over the past six year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha tri to turn washington into an evid __PUNCT__ free zone __PUNCT__
whether it stem cell research or plan b contracept or pollut or global warm or the safeti of our food or the qualiti of our air __PUNCT__ all too often __PUNCT__ ideolog ha replac fact __PUNCT__ and truth ha been the first casualti __PUNCT__
the american peopl deserv better than that __PUNCT__
wai back in the 1990 __PUNCT__ the white hous had an offic of technolog assess that wa charg with just on task __PUNCT__ tell us the truth about scienc __PUNCT__
sort out the compet claim and to the best of the scientist __PUNCT__ abil __PUNCT__ tell us what to believ __PUNCT__
for decad __PUNCT__ thei cut through the myth and the spin on everyth from star war to aid prevent to solar technolog __PUNCT__
it time we put thi offic back in busi __PUNCT__ becaus our citizen should have the inform thei need about the issu that affect them __PUNCT__
sixth __PUNCT__ we go to open up our govern balanc sheet so you can see exactli where your tax dollar ar go __PUNCT__ and the result thei get __PUNCT__
as tax dai approach __PUNCT__ you probabl find yourself wonder just where all your hard __PUNCT__ earn monei is go __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i propos that we requir govern agenc to publish their budget and their govern contract onlin for all to see __PUNCT__
so if someon tri to sneak in special favor for their special interest __PUNCT__ we can find out about it with the click of a mous __PUNCT__
and we won't just track govern spend __PUNCT__ we also track result with a new america result initi __PUNCT__
with the technolog we have todai __PUNCT__ we can get real __PUNCT__ time data on just about anyth __PUNCT__ from the puriti of our water to the health of our ecosystem to the condit of our road and bridg __PUNCT__
we gather and analyz that data to see whether our govern program ar effect __PUNCT__
we then post it onlin so that our citizen can have the most up __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ date knowledg about everyth from the qualiti of their air to the traffic on their street __PUNCT__
inform technolog is revolution everi segment of societi __PUNCT__ from busi __PUNCT__ to educ __PUNCT__ to entertain __PUNCT__ and it time that it revolution our govern as well __PUNCT__
we also need to go back to do what wa done dure the clinton administr with the reinvent govern initi __PUNCT__ known as rego __PUNCT__ which bill start and ask vice presid gore to head __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
and the result were astonish __PUNCT__
rego wa credit with save taxpay more than __MONEY__ billion over eight year by cut the feder workforc __PUNCT__ trim layer of manag __PUNCT__ cut subsidi for item like mohair and wool __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ why don't we get back to do that again if we seriou about have a govern that work __PUNCT__ we should be constantli ask ourselv the hard question about why we pai for someth __PUNCT__ and whether we should continu to do so __PUNCT__
i also want to establish a new corpor subsidi inform servic __PUNCT__
thi watchdog agenc will track everi tax subsidi that congress give to big corpor __PUNCT__
so we know exactli how much each compani get __PUNCT__ and we can track whether those subsidi actual promot result for the countri and not just the compani __PUNCT__
those subsidi ar suppos to have a public good element to them __PUNCT__
that why we provid tax dollar __PUNCT__ and yet too often __PUNCT__ we have no analysi and evalu as to whether thei ar realli worth what the taxpay ar pai __PUNCT__
seventh __PUNCT__ we go to make sure our govern pai it bill and live within it mean again __PUNCT__ just like our famili __PUNCT__
that what we did dure my husband administr __PUNCT__ when we balanc the budget and turn record deficit into surplus __PUNCT__
it took disciplin and determin __PUNCT__ a lot of hard work __PUNCT__ but again __PUNCT__ the result speak for themselv __PUNCT__
twenti __PUNCT__ two million new job __PUNCT__
the longest peacetim econom expans in histori __PUNCT__
and the save rate wa reflect in our attain leverag onc again in the world __PUNCT__
we move from the largest debtor nation to a creditor nation __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we back in to the larger debtor nation again __PUNCT__
that undermin our capac to exercis leadership on import issu like trade and other strateg concern __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we need to return to the fundament principl of pai __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ go __PUNCT__
eighth __PUNCT__ i want to make govern more user friendli across the board __PUNCT__ and that start with bring more govern servic onlin __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million american file their incom tax onlin __PUNCT__
i want to make it possibl for virtual everi transact to be paperless __PUNCT__
everi dai __PUNCT__ american read the new onlin __PUNCT__ shop onlin __PUNCT__ chat onlin __PUNCT__ and it time that our govern went fulli onlin as well __PUNCT__
in order to do that __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ we go to have to move to the ninth point of my reform agenda __PUNCT__
we have to have govern take the lead in modern it record keep system and take the lead in area that realli can chang the market and behavior to the benefit of us all __PUNCT__
what do i mean by that __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i know thi doesn't sound particularli excit __PUNCT__ but it realli import __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ just look at what happen to our veteran __PUNCT__
just earlier thi week __PUNCT__ i spent a dai in upstat new york visit with a lot of our wound and injur veteran __PUNCT__
i wa at the v.a __PUNCT__ in syracus __PUNCT__ new york __PUNCT__ and then i went up to fort drum __PUNCT__ which is up in the north countri of new york __PUNCT__
and i met with soldier who had just return from afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__
i met with over __NUM__ of them who had been injur and/or wound __PUNCT__
and here what thei told me __PUNCT__ their medic record have been lost __PUNCT__
on young soldier told me that he been hit by an i on hi convoi in baghdad __PUNCT__ which is absolut superb __PUNCT__ what our soldier get at the point where thei ar begin treatment to save their live is extraordinari __PUNCT__
we save so mani live that we couldn't have save in the first gulf war __PUNCT__
and then as he wa on a gurnei as he wa be wheel to the plane to take him to the armi medic center in landstuhl __PUNCT__ germani __PUNCT__ someon came over __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__ soldier __PUNCT__ i put thi packet on your chest __PUNCT__
it your medic record __PUNCT__ don't lose it __PUNCT__
he get on the plane __PUNCT__
he dope up for the long flight __PUNCT__
thei wheel him off in landstuhl __PUNCT__
the medic record haven't been seen sinc __PUNCT__
i hear that over and over again __PUNCT__
and when a soldier move from be treat in depart of defens facil __PUNCT__ which do provid veri good acut care __PUNCT__ to either outpati or into the v.a __PUNCT__
system __PUNCT__ the record don't get transfer __PUNCT__
the record get lost __PUNCT__
there ar so mani exampl of how our govern is ineffici becaus we can't figur out how we computer it __PUNCT__
mayb some of you have read about the year of struggl to get the fbi to have a comput system that keep track of their case __PUNCT__
still hasn't happen __PUNCT__ at the cost of billion of dollar __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we can fix thi __PUNCT__
we need to bring in privat sector partner __PUNCT__
we need to cut through red tape __PUNCT__ and we need to begin to do what it take to get our govern to have inform as readili avail as we have in the rest of our live __PUNCT__
and our govern can also lead by exampl __PUNCT__ by press nation issu like energi effici and health care reform __PUNCT__
i introduc legisl to requir that govern build becom energi effici __PUNCT__ and that new build which the govern construct try to attain the highest leed standard __PUNCT__ which is the gold standard for energi effici for a build __PUNCT__
we can help to creat market with everyth from new build materi to more energi effici applianc to more fluoresc light bulb by have the govern lead by exampl __PUNCT__
and with respect to health care reform __PUNCT__ i also work on a bipartisan basi to help creat the framework for electron medic record so that we could begin to realiz the cost save that would come if we have medic record that were privat and confidenti __PUNCT__ with encrypt code for access __PUNCT__ that could be avail if you were visit new york __PUNCT__ and you have to go to an emerg room or just visit anoth doctor here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ and not have to go through a histori again __PUNCT__ test you taken befor __PUNCT__
the rand corpor ha estim we would save __MONEY__ billion a year in our health care system if we had electron medic record __PUNCT__
and the govern ha to lead with creat the architectur and standard for us to be abl to do thi __PUNCT__ and not just creat thousand of tower of babel that can't talk to each other __PUNCT__
tenth and final __PUNCT__ we have to reform our elect system __PUNCT__
that where our democraci start __PUNCT__
we have to make sure that everi vote is count and everi vote count __PUNCT__ and we know that the best place to hold a govern account is at the ballot box __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ there been a lot of interfer with our elector system in the last year __PUNCT__ and there have been new requir that have been put up as obstacl __PUNCT__ that have realli discourag peopl from exercis their right to vote __PUNCT__
i introduc legisl call the count everi vote act __PUNCT__ which is a comprehens vote reform bill __PUNCT__
it will make our vote system more account and access __PUNCT__
it will expand the right to vote of most of our citizen __PUNCT__
it will creat more opportun for peopl to regist to vote __PUNCT__ and it will give greater assur through paper __PUNCT__ verifi ballot that those vote will be count __PUNCT__
we need more oversight in our elector system to discourag manipul and decept __PUNCT__
it is almost heart __PUNCT__ break that i have to mention thi on my reform agenda __PUNCT__
american should lead the world in the best elector system __PUNCT__ us the best equip __PUNCT__
a few year ago __PUNCT__ there wa an elect in india __PUNCT__
we ar the oldest democraci __PUNCT__
india is the largest democraci __PUNCT__
thei had an elect __PUNCT__ and no on predict the outcom __PUNCT__
everyon thought that the then __PUNCT__ bjp parti in power would be sent back in to power __PUNCT__
there wa an earthquak __PUNCT__
congress parti won the elect __PUNCT__
there were no complaint __PUNCT__
there were no disagr __PUNCT__
peopl accept the result __PUNCT__ even though indian polit can get extrem excit __PUNCT__
and i ask some of my indian friend __PUNCT__ we had two elect __PUNCT__ and we had complaint __PUNCT__ we had peopl turn awai at the vote booth __PUNCT__
we had peopl misl about where and when thei were suppos to vote __PUNCT__
we had ballot lost __PUNCT__
how could you have done thi __PUNCT__ veri simpl __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we have turn it in to into a nonpartisan __PUNCT__ civil servic effort __PUNCT__ where we have an independ board __PUNCT__ like our feder reserv board __PUNCT__ that run our nation elect __PUNCT__ and we computer everyth __PUNCT__
so whether you were a peasant woman in rajasthan __PUNCT__ or a billion dot __PUNCT__ com entrepreneur in delhi __PUNCT__ you vote on comput __PUNCT__ and in order to deal with the problem of illiteraci __PUNCT__ you had both word and pictur so that peopl could know who thei were vote for __PUNCT__
and your vote would be automat record in the comput where you were poll and in a region server and in a nation server as a failsaf __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ someon after hear that stori said __PUNCT__ well mayb we should outsourc our elect to india __PUNCT__
