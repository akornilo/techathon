i am not run to put band __PUNCT__ aid on our problem __PUNCT__ i am run to solv our problem __PUNCT__
on of us ha a plan to actual address the grow foreclosur crisi which is so terribl here in ohio __PUNCT__
i call for a freez on subprim foreclosur and interest rate to ensur that million of famili across the countri won't be receiv that grim letter from the bank __PUNCT__
i propos __MONEY__ billion in assist to help famili avoid foreclosur and to help commun rebound from thi hous crisi becaus no on should foreclos on the american dream and we go to stop it __PUNCT__

we can put peopl to work __PUNCT__
and i will also rein in the corpor special interest by elimin more than __MONEY__ billion of georg bush special break for the oil compani __PUNCT__ the drug compani and wall street __PUNCT__
we go to give the middl class a break instead __PUNCT__
we put that monei right back in your pocket onc we get it back __PUNCT__
the corpor special interest have had seven year of a presid who stand up for them __PUNCT__
i think it time we had a presid who stand up for you and i will be that presid __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ on of us ha face seriou republican opposit in the past and on of us is readi to do it again __PUNCT__
the contrast between me and our like oppon on the republican side could not be starker __PUNCT__
senat mccain is will to continu the war in iraq for __NUM__ year he said __PUNCT__
i will start bring troop home within __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
he admit he doesn't understand the economi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i have a plan to turn our economi around and creat five million new job and we can __PUNCT__
we can do that work togeth __PUNCT__
senat mccain realli want eight ear more of the same __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i go to deliv __NUM__ centuri solut that will move our countri forward again __PUNCT__
we focu on the problem right here in ohio and begin to solv them __PUNCT__
both senat obama and i would make histori but onli on of us is readi on dai on to be command in chief __PUNCT__ readi to manag our economi and readi to defeat the republican __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ onli on of us ha spent __NUM__ year be a doer __PUNCT__ a fighter and a champion for those who need a voic __PUNCT__
that is what i would bring to the white hous again __PUNCT__
that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
after the past seven year that choic couldn't be more import becaus for seven long year we had a govern of __PUNCT__ by and for the corpor special interest __PUNCT__
thei have been heard first __PUNCT__ thei have been heard loudest and thei have drown out everyon els __PUNCT__
and while you pinch penni to stai within your budget __PUNCT__ the presid blew the bank on tax break for hi friend and no __PUNCT__ bid contract for hi croni __PUNCT__ borrow hundr of billion of dollar from china to pai for it all __PUNCT__
he ha sign a subprim mortgag on america econom futur and that your futur __PUNCT__
and so when peopl ask me __PUNCT__ why can't we get tough on china __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when wa the last time you got tough on your banker __PUNCT__
and so we have to get back to fiscal respons in order to get tough on china becaus we shouldn't be borrow so much monei from them __PUNCT__
china steel come here and our job go there __PUNCT__
we plai by the rule __PUNCT__ thei manipul their currenc __PUNCT__
and we get taint fish __PUNCT__ lead lace toi and poison pet food in return __PUNCT__
i think that a pretti raw deal __PUNCT__ don't you __PUNCT__ let be honest about someth __PUNCT__
when presid bush and vice presid chenei sai the economi is boom even though three million manufactur job have been lost __PUNCT__ when their administr sai outsourc is a plu for our economi __PUNCT__ or when senat mccain that busi as usual on trade is just fine __PUNCT__ when he think make tax cut for the wealthi perman is a top econom prioriti __PUNCT__ thei send you a clear messag __PUNCT__ the struggl of middl class and work famili simpli don't matter __PUNCT__
your voic just don't matter __PUNCT__
thei think the economi work as long as it work for their friend at the top __PUNCT__
when good job leav __PUNCT__ thei think that just the price of admiss to the global marketplac __PUNCT__
thei think it would be fine if everi plane __PUNCT__ everi piec of machineri __PUNCT__ everi comput and everi car were made somewher els __PUNCT__
i could not disagre more and don't you also youngstown __PUNCT__ some peopl mai call thi the rust belt but that not what i see __PUNCT__ i see some of the hardest work peopl in the world __PUNCT__
i see great univers and strong neighborhood and famili __PUNCT__
i see commun where young peopl should be abl to find good job and no on should ever have to leav their famili to earn their live __PUNCT__
i see a __NUM__ centuri manufactur belt __PUNCT__ an innov belt __PUNCT__ an opportun belt that will onc again put us on the forefront of the world economi __PUNCT__
i see a middl class comeback that start right here and right now in place like thi __PUNCT__ place just like youngstown __PUNCT__
in youngstown __PUNCT__ you have start up compani thrive as a new busi incub __PUNCT__
place like warren where the gm plant i visit is __PUNCT__

place like akron where cut edg manufactur job and technolog innov ar realli attract and keep highli skill young worker __PUNCT__
let start work togeth to build the america that we believ in and let level the plai field against the corpor special interest __PUNCT__
we go to deliv __NUM__ centuri solut to rebuild the middl class __PUNCT__
let get real about our futur start right now __PUNCT__
let get real about the futur of trade in thi countri __PUNCT__
let get real about nafta __PUNCT__ it simpli isn't work for all american __PUNCT__
i not just go to talk about what wrong with nafta __PUNCT__ i go to fix it and i have a four __PUNCT__ point plan to do exactli that __PUNCT__
first we have the strongest possibl labor and environment standard in the core nafta agreement __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we wont let foreign countri undermin worker protect as thei do right now __PUNCT__
these compani can challeng american regul intend to protect american worker and the environ __PUNCT__
that is not accept and i will chang that __PUNCT__
i will strengthen nafta enforc mechan to remov trade barrier and better protect american job __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ we review thi agreement and everi other trade agreement regularli __PUNCT__
if it not rais live standard right here in america and protect american worker __PUNCT__ then we not go to have it be a race to the bottom __PUNCT__
we will never again let fourteen year go by without updat and modern our trade agreement __PUNCT__
my oppon ha taken to attack me on nafta __PUNCT__
the fact is neither of us were in the senat at the time and i long been a critic of the shortcom of nafta __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ when we were both in the senat __PUNCT__ senat dorgan propos amend that i thought wa just common sens __PUNCT__
it said that our trade negoti shouldn't enter into ani agreement that undermin basic protect for american worker __PUNCT__
it said we shouldn't allow foreign countri to unfairli dump their product into the american marketplac in a wai that damag u. competit __PUNCT__
so i stood with american worker and i vote for it __PUNCT__
senat obama stood with the bush administr and vote against it __PUNCT__
that is a big differ between us __PUNCT__
my oppon claim to stand up for worker __PUNCT__ he often talk about the plight of the maytag worker in hi home state __PUNCT__
but the union at that plant support me becaus when __NUM__ job were be lost __PUNCT__ thei sai he didn't do a thing to help __PUNCT__
we also go to get tough with china __PUNCT__
otherwis we keep lose job __PUNCT__
the currenc manipul ha to stop __PUNCT__ the trade barrier have to come down __PUNCT__
china is go to have to be our trade partner __PUNCT__ not our trade master __PUNCT__
we go to level the plai field __PUNCT__
it time that we make trade work for work famili __PUNCT__
that why i oppos fast __PUNCT__ track author for georg bush __PUNCT__ becaus we can't allow him to ram through deal on hi wai out the door __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will take a time __PUNCT__ out from new agreement until we have a trade polici that is genuin pro __PUNCT__ worker and pro __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__
no on will get awai with violat our trade agreement anymor becaus we start enforc them vigor and without fail __PUNCT__
