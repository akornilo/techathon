couric __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ you had an impress victori yesterdai in west virginia __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ accord to our poll __PUNCT__ an overwhelm number of your support in that state __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ said thei would not be satisfi with barack obama with the democrat nomine __PUNCT__
sixti __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ percent __PUNCT__ of your support said the same thing after the pennsylvania primari __PUNCT__
isn't that evidenc that __PUNCT__ by stai in thi race __PUNCT__ you ar divid the parti __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ not at all __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ a primari alwai creat passion feel in support __PUNCT__
my oppon have a lot of support who sai the same thing __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__
but onc we have a nomine __PUNCT__ which we don't yet have __PUNCT__ we have a unifi democrat parti __PUNCT__
and i gonna work my heart out to make sure we elect a democrat presid __PUNCT__
i will make the strongest possibl argument that anyon who vote for me or vote for sen __PUNCT__ obama ha much more in common than thei do with sen __PUNCT__ mccain and the republican __PUNCT__
we cannot afford four more year of these fail republican polici __PUNCT__
and the onli wai we replac them __PUNCT__ sinc __PUNCT__ i sorri to sai __PUNCT__ appear sen __PUNCT__ mccain is offer more of the same __PUNCT__ is by elect a democrat __PUNCT__
so i confid we have a unifi parti __PUNCT__ we make a strong case __PUNCT__ and will be victori in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ yet __PUNCT__ nearli a third of your support in both west virginia and pennsylvania said if you ar not the nomine thei will vote for john mccain in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
so do you think stai in thi race help john mccain the most __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ not at all __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i believ it would hurt our eventu nomine if it is not me __PUNCT__ if i were to get out of thi race befor everyon had a chanc to vote __PUNCT__
becaus it would appear as though i had been somehow push out __PUNCT__
peopl had been depriv their right to vote __PUNCT__
we will finish thi process __PUNCT__
we will finish the elect that ar still to come __PUNCT__
we will seat the michigan and florida deleg __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__ by __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and then we have a nomine __PUNCT__ or veri close to it __PUNCT__ and we know who the nomine is __PUNCT__
and i will be in a veri strong posit __PUNCT__ as will sen __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ to make the case that we fought a hard fight __PUNCT__ everybodi particip __PUNCT__ now it time to coalesc behind our nomine __PUNCT__
and i think we get a lot of peopl to agre with that __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ so that on third number __PUNCT__ nearli on third number of peopl who vote for you in west virginia and pennsylvania sai thei would rather have john mccain in __DATE__ than barack obama __PUNCT__ it doesn't troubl you __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ becaus there ar a lot of sen __PUNCT__ obama support __PUNCT__ if you go back and look at poll __PUNCT__ who sai the same thing __PUNCT__
that thei won't vote __PUNCT__
thei stai home __PUNCT__
i that the heat of the primari speak __PUNCT__
and that what happen in the primari __PUNCT__
but thi ha been a veri posit and civil primari elect process __PUNCT__
and i am absolut confid that onc we have a nomine both sen __PUNCT__ obama and i ar gonna work as hard as we can to make the case to our support that thei should support the nomine so we can have a democrat presid __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ you have the support of blue __PUNCT__ collar white voter __PUNCT__
but you onli get about eight percent of african __PUNCT__ american voter __PUNCT__
and that usual __PUNCT__ as you know sen __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ what republican get __PUNCT__
what do you think is behind thi racial divid __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i think it pride __PUNCT__
i think it excit __PUNCT__
i absolut understand and respect that __PUNCT__
but onc we get to __DATE__ __PUNCT__ my support __PUNCT__ hi support __PUNCT__ no matter who thei ar __PUNCT__ ar gonna take a hard look at john mccain in the cours of the campaign and realiz thi is someon who didn't support dr __PUNCT__ martin luther king holidai __PUNCT__
thi is someon who ha support presid bush down the line on so mani of the issu that realli matter to peopl no matter who thei ar and where thei live __PUNCT__
we gonna make a veri strong case why our democrat nomine should attract everi singl on of the __NUM__ million peopl who have vote for us __PUNCT__
i receiv nearli __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama receiv nearli __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ i slightli ahead __PUNCT__
those __NUM__ million peopl __PUNCT__ thei will end up vote for the democrat becaus there is no reason why thei should want to continu the fail polici of georg bush __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ when you give those number you includ florida and michigan __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
becaus those were legitim certifi elect that were legal and valid __PUNCT__ and peopl actual exercis their right to vote __PUNCT__
the onli disput is how do thei get the deleg out of those vote __PUNCT__ couric __PUNCT__ and i rais thi with you befor __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ but barack obama name wasn't even on the ballot in michigan __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that wa hi choic __PUNCT__
he didn't have to take hi name off __PUNCT__
there wa no rule requir that he took hi name off __PUNCT__
but he did run __PUNCT__ along with hi support __PUNCT__ a veri vigor campaign to get peopl to vote uncommit __PUNCT__
so he had a presenc there __PUNCT__ even though hi name wasn't on the ballot __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl were struck last week when you note that you had won the support of hard work american __PUNCT__ white american __PUNCT__
us those word __PUNCT__ do you think that wa danger close to plai the revers race card __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ not at all __PUNCT__
i wa just refer to an ap articl __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ peopl have vote for me becaus thei believ i be a better fighter and a better champion __PUNCT__
thei believ i would fight for univers healthcar __PUNCT__
that i make colleg afford __PUNCT__
that i try to do someth about these outrag ga price __PUNCT__
that i have a real plan to get out of iraq __PUNCT__
so i think that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ there is no doubt that we had a wonder __PUNCT__ incred histor campaign __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ race and gender ar part of it __PUNCT__ becaus of who the candid ar __PUNCT__
but peopl have been vote base on who thei thought would be the better presid and the stronger candid against sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but do you think us the phrase __PUNCT__ white american __PUNCT__ wa load and possibl polar __PUNCT__ do you regret it at all __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i just wa quot from an articl __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ if it gave ani paus to anyon then i regret that __PUNCT__
but it wa __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it wa just an articl that had been written __PUNCT__ not by me __PUNCT__ but by an object new servic __PUNCT__
but thi ha been an incred posit and civil campaign __PUNCT__
and we brought so mani new peopl into the process that i think __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ onc we get to a nomin we go to close rank behind our nomine __PUNCT__
and all voter from everi part of our countri ar go to recogn that we must elect a democrat presid __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ if barack obama declar victori __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ onc he reach that magic number of __NUM__ will you still hold out if florida and michigan have not been count __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
becaus that not the right number __PUNCT__
how can we have a nomine base on __NUM__ state __PUNCT__ especi two state that ar so critic import to the democrat chanc in the fall __PUNCT__
i think that would be a mistak __PUNCT__
we gonna finish thi process in three week __PUNCT__
i just think everybodi ought to take a deep breath __PUNCT__
we go to __PUNCT__ by __DATE__ __PUNCT__ have all the remain primari __PUNCT__
we have the democrat nation committe make a decis about florida and michigan __PUNCT__
and then we will be abl to look at where each of us stand __PUNCT__
and that what i think is the proper wai to proce __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ can you lai out for me __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ the scenario where __PUNCT__ over the next sever week __PUNCT__ you get enough deleg to win thi nomin __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ certainli __PUNCT__
i think that we do well in these upcom contest __PUNCT__
i think we will get deleg out of florida and michigan __PUNCT__
i think the super deleg ar not bound to support anyon __PUNCT__
thei don't have to stai with ani person __PUNCT__
thei can make a decis todai and chang it tomorrow __PUNCT__
and their job __PUNCT__ accord to the rule of the dnc __PUNCT__ is to exercis independ judgment to determin who would be the best presid __PUNCT__ and who would be the better __PUNCT__ stronger candid against john mccain __PUNCT__
and i think i have a stronger case __PUNCT__
i think at the end of thi process that case will be self evid and we see what happen __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but nation poll show you and sen __PUNCT__ obama do equal well against sen __PUNCT__ mccain __PUNCT__
so why do you continu to insist that you ar __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ more elect __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ those ar nation poll __PUNCT__
but if you look at state __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ state poll __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ how we conduct nation elect __PUNCT__ becaus you have to get to __NUM__ elector vote __PUNCT__ i won state with more than __NUM__ elector vote __PUNCT__
sen __PUNCT__ obama ha won state with __NUM__ elector vote __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some of the state i won __PUNCT__ like texa and oklahoma and indiana ar long shot to be in the democrat column __PUNCT__
but mani of the state he won __PUNCT__ like alaska and idaho and utah and nebraska and kansa ar also veri long shot __PUNCT__
and i am closer __PUNCT__ if you look at the elector map __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ if we had the same rule as the republican have __PUNCT__ i would be the republican nomine right now __PUNCT__
and i think it time peopl start look at the elector map __PUNCT__
i know on of the new channel had an elector map dure their coverag last night __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__
it a pretti convinc stori __PUNCT__
i carri the big state __PUNCT__
i carri the swing state __PUNCT__
i carri the state a democrat ha to carri in order to win __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ after your victori in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ you mention super deleg a minut ago __PUNCT__ after your victori in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ barack obama won __PUNCT__ so far __PUNCT__ the commit of __NUM__ super deleg __PUNCT__
you net __NUM__ __PUNCT__
aren't thing trend hi wai in the super deleg depart __PUNCT__ clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we both have been pick up super deleg __PUNCT__
i think that will continu __PUNCT__
but i go back __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ but he gotten __NUM__ senat __PUNCT__ and you gotten __NUM__ __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ but i go back to the basic point __PUNCT__
the game isn't over __PUNCT__
the elect aren't over __PUNCT__
no buzzer ha sound __PUNCT__
we have to get to __NUM__ deleg and then we have a nomine __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ until we get there __PUNCT__ we not like to know who that nomine will be __PUNCT__
couric __PUNCT__ can you just help me understand __PUNCT__ and perhap viewer as well __PUNCT__ i thought the reason michigan and florida weren't be count wa becaus thei defi the dnc calendar __PUNCT__
clinton __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei did __PUNCT__ but so did other state __PUNCT__
and the other state didn't face ani kind of penalti __PUNCT__
and that the argument that is be made by __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ peopl from michigan and florida __PUNCT__
who ar point out that if the dnc rule ar to be appli evenli then other state would have also been penal __PUNCT__ the republican face the same dilemma __PUNCT__
thei quickli dispos of it __PUNCT__
thei decid to award __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
deleg __PUNCT__
thei went on __PUNCT__
we haven't made a decis yet __PUNCT__
but we certainli must make a decis __PUNCT__
and that decis __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__ will be made on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
