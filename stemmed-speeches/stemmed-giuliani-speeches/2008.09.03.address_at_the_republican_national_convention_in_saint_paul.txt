everi four year __PUNCT__ we ar told that thi presidenti elect is the most import elect of our lifetim __PUNCT__
thi year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ is the most import __PUNCT__
thi ha alreadi been histor __PUNCT__
it is the longest presidenti campaign in histori __PUNCT__
and it sometim felt even longer __PUNCT__
the american peopl realiz thi elect repres a turn point __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ we the peopl __PUNCT__ the citizen of the unit state __PUNCT__ get to decid our next __URL__ the media __PUNCT__ not hollywood celebr __PUNCT__ not anyon els __PUNCT__
thi is a time for choos __PUNCT__ and to those american who still feel torn in thi elect __PUNCT__ i like to suggest on wai to think about the choic you have to make in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ you hire someon to do a job __PUNCT__ an import job that involv the safeti and secur of your famili __PUNCT__
imagin that you have two job applic in your hand __PUNCT__ with the name and parti affili taken off the top __PUNCT__
thei both good and patriot men __PUNCT__ with veri differ life experi that have led them to thi moment in histori __PUNCT__
you got to make thi decis right __PUNCT__
who would you hire __PUNCT__ on the on hand __PUNCT__ you got a man who ha dedic hi life to the servic of hi countri __PUNCT__
he been test time and again by crisi __PUNCT__
he pass everi test __PUNCT__
even hi adversari acknowledg that he is a true american hero __PUNCT__
he love america as we all do __PUNCT__ but he sacrif for it as few do __PUNCT__
as a young man __PUNCT__ he join the __URL__ be a __PUNCT__ top gun __PUNCT__ kind of gui __PUNCT__ he becam a fighter pilot __PUNCT__
he wa on a mission over hanoi when hi plane wa shot down __PUNCT__
he wa tortur in a pow camp __PUNCT__ but he refus hi captor __PUNCT__ offer of earli releas __PUNCT__
becaus thi is a man who believ in serv a caus greater than self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
he came home a nation hero __PUNCT__
he had earn a life of peac and quiet __PUNCT__ but he wa call to public servic again __PUNCT__ run for congress and then the senat as a proud foot __PUNCT__ soldier in the reagan revolut __PUNCT__
hi principl independ never waver __PUNCT__
he stood up to special interest __PUNCT__ fought for fiscal disciplin __PUNCT__ ethic reform and a strong nation defens __PUNCT__
that on man __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ you have a resum from a gift man with an ivi leagu educ __PUNCT__
he work as a commun organ __PUNCT__ and immers himself in chicago machin polit __PUNCT__
then he ran for the state legislatur __PUNCT__ where nearli __NUM__ time he wa unabl to make a decis ye or no __PUNCT__
he simpli vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__
as mayor of new york citi __PUNCT__ i never got a chanc to vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ when you presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ you can't just vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__
you must make decis __PUNCT__
a few year later __PUNCT__ he ran for the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
he won and ha spent most of hi time as a __PUNCT__ celebr senat __PUNCT__
no leadership or major legisl to speak of __PUNCT__
hi rise is remark in it own right __PUNCT__ it the kind of thing that could happen onli in america __PUNCT__
but he never run a citi __PUNCT__ never run a state __PUNCT__ never run a busi __PUNCT__
he never had to lead peopl in crisi __PUNCT__
thi is not a person __URL__ a statement of fact __PUNCT__ barack obama ha never led anyth __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__
nada __PUNCT__
the choic in thi elect come down to substanc over style __PUNCT__
john ha been test __PUNCT__
barack obama ha not __PUNCT__
tough time requir strong leadership __PUNCT__ and thi is no time for on the job train __PUNCT__
it about who can answer that crisi call __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ hillari __PUNCT__ at __NUM__ in the morn __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ no on can look at john mccain and sai that he is not readi to be command in chief __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ our oppon want to refram the debat __PUNCT__
thei would have you believ that thi elect is about __PUNCT__ chang versu more of the same __PUNCT__
but that realli a fals choic __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ chang __PUNCT__ is not a destin __PUNCT__
just as __PUNCT__ hope __PUNCT__ is not a strategi __PUNCT__
john mccain will bring about the chang that will creat job and prosper __PUNCT__
he will lower tax so our economi can grow __PUNCT__
he will reduc govern spend to strengthen our dollar __PUNCT__
he will expand free trade so we can be even more competit __PUNCT__
he will lead us toward an america that will be independ of foreign oil by an all __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ abov approach __PUNCT__ includ nuclear power and off __PUNCT__ shore drill __PUNCT__
thi is the kind of chang we need __PUNCT__
and he will keep us on offens against terror at home and abroad __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ dai in denver and for the past __NUM__ month democrat have been afraid to us the word __PUNCT__ islam terror __PUNCT__
dure their convent __PUNCT__ the democrat rare mention the attack of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thei ar in a state of denial about the threat that face us now and in the futur __PUNCT__
you need to face your enemi in order to defeat them __PUNCT__
john mccain will face thi threat and lead us on to victori __PUNCT__
look at just on exampl in a lifetim of principl stand __PUNCT__ john mccain support for the troop surg in iraq __PUNCT__
the democrat parti had given up on iraq __PUNCT__
and i believ __PUNCT__ ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ that when thei gave up on iraq thei were give up on america __PUNCT__
the democrat leader in the senat said so __PUNCT__ america ha lost __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ if america lost __PUNCT__ who won __PUNCT__ al qaida __PUNCT__ bin laden __PUNCT__ in the singl biggest polici decis of thi elect __PUNCT__ john mccain got it right and barack obama got it wrong __PUNCT__
if barack obama had been presid __PUNCT__ there would have been no troop surg and our troop would have been withdrawn in defeat __PUNCT__
senat mccain wa the candid most associ with the surg __PUNCT__
and it wa unpopular __PUNCT__
what do you think most other candid would have done in that situat __PUNCT__ thei would have act in their own self __PUNCT__ interest by chang their posit __PUNCT__
how mani time have we seen barack obama do that __PUNCT__ obama wa go to take public financ for hi campaign __PUNCT__ until he didn't __PUNCT__
obama wa against wiretap befor he vote for it __PUNCT__
when speak to a pro __PUNCT__ israel group __PUNCT__ obama favor an undivid jerusalem __PUNCT__
until the veri next dai when he chang hi mind __PUNCT__
i hope for hi sake __PUNCT__ joe biden got that vp thing in write __PUNCT__
john mccain said __PUNCT__ i rather lose an elect than a war __PUNCT__
becaus that john mccain __PUNCT__
when russia roll over georgia __PUNCT__ john mccain knew exactli how to respond __PUNCT__
have been to that part of the world mani time and have develop a clear worldview over mani year __PUNCT__ john knew where he stood __PUNCT__
within hour __PUNCT__ he establish a veri strong __PUNCT__ inform posit that let the world know exactli how he respond as presid __PUNCT__
at exactli the right time __PUNCT__ john mccain said __PUNCT__ we all georgian __PUNCT__
obama first instinct wa to creat a moral equival __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ both side __PUNCT__ should __PUNCT__ show restraint __PUNCT__
the same moral equival that he ha displai in discuss the palestinian author and the state of israel __PUNCT__
later __PUNCT__ after discuss it with hi __NUM__ foreign polici advisor __PUNCT__ he chang hi posit and suggest that the __PUNCT__ the un secur council __PUNCT__ could find a solut __PUNCT__
appar __PUNCT__ none of hi __NUM__ advisor told him that russia ha a veto on ani un action __PUNCT__
final obama put out a statement that __URL__ it look a lot like john mccain __PUNCT__
here some free advic __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ next time just call john mccain __PUNCT__
like ronald reagan __PUNCT__ john mccain will enlarg our parti __PUNCT__
he the candid with the real record of bi __PUNCT__ partisan cooper __PUNCT__
he the candid who can credibl reach out for the vote of independ and democrat __PUNCT__
in choos governor sarah palin as hi run mate __PUNCT__ john mccain ha chosen the futur __PUNCT__
governor palin repres a new gener __PUNCT__
she alreadi on of the most success governor in america __PUNCT__ and the most popular __PUNCT__
and she alreadi ha more execut experi than the entir democrat ticket __PUNCT__
she led a citi and a state __PUNCT__
she reduc tax and govern spend __PUNCT__
and she actual done someth about move america toward energi independ __PUNCT__ take on the oil compani while encourag more energi explor here at home __PUNCT__
taxpay have an advoc in sarah palin __PUNCT__ she even sold the former governor privat plane on e __PUNCT__ bai __PUNCT__
and as a former u. __PUNCT__ attornei __PUNCT__ i am impress by her success in combat corrupt __PUNCT__ when she found uneth and illeg behavior among the power __PUNCT__ broker of her own parti __PUNCT__ she did not hesit __PUNCT__ she act courag and independ __PUNCT__
that the kind of reform we need __PUNCT__ she shook up alaska __PUNCT__
she shake up washington __PUNCT__
and we sure need that __PUNCT__
and as we look to the futur never let us forget that __PUNCT__ when we ar at our best __PUNCT__ we ar the parti that expand freedom __PUNCT__
we began as a parti dedic to free peopl from slaveri __PUNCT__
and we ar still the parti that is will to fight for freedom at home and around the world __PUNCT__
we ar the parti that want to expand individu freedom and econom freedom __PUNCT__ becaus we believ that the secret of america success is not central govern __PUNCT__ it is self __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
