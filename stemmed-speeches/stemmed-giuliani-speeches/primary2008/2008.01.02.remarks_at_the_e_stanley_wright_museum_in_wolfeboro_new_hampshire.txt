__PUNCT__ w __PUNCT__ e here in a museum that repres the achiev of the greatest gener __PUNCT__ what is regard as the greatest gener becaus thei had to deal with the depress and thei had to deal with the second world war __PUNCT__ challeng of massiv proport __PUNCT__
and it remind us that the challeng that we have in our gener __PUNCT__ although it a big on __PUNCT__ no on minim it __PUNCT__ least of all i think us __PUNCT__ but the realiti is when you think of what our ancestor went through __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ grandpar and you look at what we have to go through you don't find that it beyond the capac of american to handl thing like thi __PUNCT__
i mean our challeng is the terrorist __PUNCT__ war on us __PUNCT__ that the challeng of our gener __PUNCT__
it the challeng that ha been hand to us __PUNCT__ we didn't go look for it __PUNCT__ just like __PUNCT__ go back to parent __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ depend on your ag __PUNCT__ thei weren't look for a depress and thei weren't look for a second world war __PUNCT__
that not someth that thei want but thei were abl __PUNCT__ when it came about __PUNCT__ to deal with it and to deal with it in an effect wai that ha made them legendari __PUNCT__
now we have to have that same resolv about thi challeng that ha been put on us __PUNCT__ which is thi terrorist __PUNCT__ war on us __PUNCT__ which __DATE__ certainli wa a main act in that war __PUNCT__ but not the onli on __PUNCT__
there were a lot of act befor __DATE__ and there have been a lot of attempt act and unfortun other that actual took place sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__
so i think it wouldn't be unfair to describ us as the 9/11 gener __PUNCT__ becaus how we handl thi is go to sai someth about us in histori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__ actual specif sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ our nation ha been on offens against terror __PUNCT__
as a consequ it look like we stop about twenti __PUNCT__ three terrorist attack __PUNCT__ at least that the public inform that we can find when we look through all of the report __PUNCT__
i mean it could be more becaus we don't know all the secret __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ classifi inform __PUNCT__
and these were attack that were direct against american and our alli at home and abroad __PUNCT__
but our success that we had in stop these shouldn't lead us to a fals sens of secur __PUNCT__
and the realiti is that i __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ throughout the cours of thi campaign have been troubl by the fact that i believ that the lead democrat candid ar take us back or want to take us back to that period befor __DATE__ __PUNCT__ when we were on defens __PUNCT__
in fact it goe so far as thei seem to find difficulti describ the threat as an islam terrorist threat __PUNCT__ and i don't know why thei find it difficult sai that __PUNCT__
that doesn't offend anyon __PUNCT__ other than a terrorist __PUNCT__
we know and we known from the begin __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ of thi effort when we focus on it __PUNCT__ that thi is a small group of peopl __PUNCT__ doesn't typifi at all an entir group either by religion or by ethnic or anyth els __PUNCT__
but it doe signifi a group of peopl who have convert what origin were religi belief into a polit ideolog and an ideolog of violenc and attack __PUNCT__
so we got to be abl to face what you deal with in order to deal with it __PUNCT__ whether it an enemi or a group of enemi __PUNCT__ you got to be abl to face it squar in order to deal with it __PUNCT__
and the assassin last week of benazir bhutto wa a remind __PUNCT__
it remind us that thi war is not over and it remind us why i refer to it as the terrorist __PUNCT__ war on us becaus it a war against us and we on offens becaus that is the best wai to deal with it __PUNCT__
we in the middl of a struggl that put freedom versu fundament __PUNCT__ hope versu fear __PUNCT__ democraci versu conflict __PUNCT__
we didn't seek thi conflict __PUNCT__ we didn't start thi conflict but we must finish it and we will win it __PUNCT__
i guarante you that we will win it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ now is the time for strong vigor leadership __PUNCT__
now is the time for an experienc execut __PUNCT__ who ha solv similarli insurmount problem in the past __PUNCT__
and now is the time for a leader who can lead america right now in a peril world toward a realist peac __PUNCT__
and i believ i that candid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i believ i the on who can help us get through thi in the most effect wai possibl __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ throughout histori we been confront at time by tyrant and dictat and bulli __PUNCT__ who calcul that our will is weak __PUNCT__
thei believ __PUNCT__ mayb becaus of our democraci __PUNCT__ thei believ that we undisciplin and divid becaus thei hear a lot of disagr between and among us becaus that what a democraci is about __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ osama bin laden is just the latest in a long line __PUNCT__ or at least a line of dictat and terrorist and bulli and peopl in that categori who somehow hear all thi divis that we have and think that it a sign of weak __PUNCT__
he believ our countri is prone to __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ panic and retreat __PUNCT__ close quot __PUNCT__
that we ar __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ built on a weak and hollow foundat __PUNCT__ close quot __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ you and i know that america is stronger __PUNCT__ much stronger __PUNCT__ becaus of our abil to disagre with each other in a peac wai and in a decent wai __PUNCT__ which is the hallmark of democraci __PUNCT__ and that we stand up to tyrant and dictat and terrorist and bulli __PUNCT__
we done it in the past __PUNCT__ we go to do it again __PUNCT__ and no on __PUNCT__ absolut no on __PUNCT__ should mistak our democraci for a lack of resolv to defend ourselv and to protect ourselv __PUNCT__
and i think i speak on behalf of everi candid and just __PUNCT__ about __PUNCT__ everi american in that regard __PUNCT__
america is the land of the free becaus we the home of the brave __PUNCT__
that the reason that we the land of the free __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ our goal have to be veri __PUNCT__ veri clear __PUNCT__
we should make them clear __PUNCT__
i think we know what thei ar __PUNCT__ but it worth repeat some of them so that we remind ourselv of it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ osama bin laden must be caught and brought to justic __PUNCT__
al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ hezbollah __PUNCT__ and hama have to feel increas pressur on everi level __PUNCT__
we have to make certain that we complet the job with al __PUNCT__ qaeda and with the taliban __PUNCT__
america is go to stai on offens and we go to win the terrorist __PUNCT__ war on us __PUNCT__
that will happen __PUNCT__ but our option __PUNCT__ whether we remain on offens or we go back on defens will dictat how long thi all take place __PUNCT__
so we go to win becaus our idea ar the best __PUNCT__
our idea ar go to prevail ultim __PUNCT__
our idea of freedom __PUNCT__ freedom for all peopl __PUNCT__ freedom for women __PUNCT__ freedom of religion __PUNCT__ these idea will allow us ultim to prevail __PUNCT__
our strategi will determin __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ how fast we prevail or how long thi struggl __PUNCT__ war if you will __PUNCT__ will go on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ keep america safe must be the first prioriti of the next american presid __PUNCT__
our countri need a comprehens plan of action __PUNCT__
our long __PUNCT__ term object is to win thi war on us and our current object ha to be to prevent ani terrorist attack __PUNCT__ or at least to do everyth we can to do that __PUNCT__
so i go to outlin for you briefli my plan to win thi war __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ achiev realist peac through overwhelm strength __PUNCT__
it go to requir expand our militari __PUNCT__ refocus our intellig __PUNCT__ improv even more our homeland secur __PUNCT__ and win the war of idea against these radic __PUNCT__
four thing at least __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so first __PUNCT__ expand our militari __PUNCT__
we need to increas the size of our militari __PUNCT__
we need to be abl to have a much larger __PUNCT__ or a larger militari to deal both with the terrorist threat and anyth els that thrown at us __PUNCT__
we have never __PUNCT__ ever made up for the damag that wa done to our militari from the peac dividend taken in the 1990 dure the clinton administr __PUNCT__
these were huge cut in our militari budget of twenti and thirti percent __PUNCT__
huge cut in the number of troop that we have and some of it ha been made up for __PUNCT__ but not all of it __PUNCT__ and not even most of it __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__
so we go to have to increas the size of our militari __PUNCT__
on of the thing that we should do right now __PUNCT__ i believ we should do it immedi __PUNCT__ is we should doubl the number of our troop who ar american led combat troop in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we need to bring a surg to afghanistan and make it effect right now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i believ act now will help us in the effort to find bin laden __PUNCT__
it will help us in the effort to make sure that we solidifi the gain we made in __NUM__ and __NUM__ in rout al __PUNCT__ qaeda and rout the taliban __PUNCT__
and i believ it will act as a wai to assist in stabil the entir region __PUNCT__
now peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ our militari is stretch __PUNCT__ what with iraq and our present effort in afghanistan __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we should increas the size of our militari __PUNCT__
right awai __PUNCT__ we should increas it by at least __NUM__ new combat __PUNCT__ readi brigad for the armi __PUNCT__
and that should be done now __PUNCT__
and then more increas ar necessari __PUNCT__ we should do the addit increas __PUNCT__
the air forc next gener bomber __PUNCT__ fighter __PUNCT__ and refuel tanker __PUNCT__
the marin have to be at least __NUM__ and our navi ha to be at __NUM__ ship or more __PUNCT__
and america coast guard need addit resourc and personnel becaus thei take on heighten respons with regard to our border as part of homeland secur __PUNCT__
so these increas ar necessari __PUNCT__
rememb __PUNCT__ that our commit in vietnam went up to __NUM__ soldier __PUNCT__ if i recal correctli __PUNCT__ and our commit in korea were about __NUM__ soldier __PUNCT__
so the realiti is the commit we look for here both in iraq and afghanistan ar not histor out of line by ani mean __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ thei well within what been done in the past __PUNCT__
it is true that there is some strain felt and the best wai to answer that is increas the size of our militari so we capabl of do thi __PUNCT__
i believ we capabl of do it within present resourc __PUNCT__ but also we have to keep an ey on other would __PUNCT__ be challeng __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so a larg militari __PUNCT__ a larg commit to our militari not onli is go to help in thi terrorist __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ it also go to help make sure that these would __PUNCT__ be challeng remain on a peac cours __PUNCT__
rememb we won the cold war on a theori that __PUNCT__ someon express it thi wai __PUNCT__ that we outspent the soviet union into oblivion __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we don't want to outspend anyon into oblivion __PUNCT__ except the terrorist __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ we want them over with __PUNCT__ but with regard to these would __PUNCT__ be challeng __PUNCT__ we want them to know that it doesn't make sens to challeng us __PUNCT__
then we got to modern and transform our militari __PUNCT__
that why i call sever month ago for a new hybrid militari and civilian corp to help rebuild area after the battl __PUNCT__ after the war take place and stabil the fail on __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ when you look carefulli at iraq and what happen in iraq __PUNCT__ the pure militari part of it wa brilliant execut __PUNCT__
i believ it wa twenti __PUNCT__ three dai from the time we enter iraq until the time that we chase saddam hussein out of power __PUNCT__
that is lightn fast __PUNCT__
i believ __PUNCT__ if the nation intellig estim is correct and iraq __PUNCT__ iran rather __PUNCT__ stop their nuclear program in __NUM__ in __NUM__ rather __PUNCT__ as a result of what happen in iraq __PUNCT__ i would sai that that had a lot to do with it __PUNCT__
i would sai that our action in afghanistan __PUNCT__ our action in iraq would have someth to do with the fact that iran stop their nuclear program __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ be strong is enorm import __PUNCT__
the bottom line __PUNCT__ if i the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ i guarante you that i will hand the countri over to the next presid stronger than it wa hand to me __PUNCT__
everi presid should guarante that becaus thi countri ha to be stronger __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ but battlefield strength is just not enough __PUNCT__
we need to also improv our intellig capabl __PUNCT__
the sixteen intellig agenc that ar current lead thi effort ar overlap __PUNCT__ and i mention the nation intellig estim __PUNCT__ just to be clear on it __PUNCT__ what that intellig estim said wa that with high confid that iran stop it nuclear weapon program back in __NUM__ but express onli moder confid that the program ha not resum or been restart sinc then __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you got to put those two phrase togeth __PUNCT__
high confid __PUNCT__ moder confid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the high confid __PUNCT__ i think if that correct would have someth to do with what we did in iraq and what we do in afghanistan and the presenc of our troop and all the pressur we were put on them in so mani other wai as well __PUNCT__ and the estim doe sai that pressur work __PUNCT__ which i think make sens __PUNCT__ but i think when you look at thi whole thing __PUNCT__ the high confid and the moder confid __PUNCT__ you have to sai it should not alter what would be and should be and is __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ a firm american polici __PUNCT__ and i will underscor thi polici __PUNCT__ we will not allow iran to becom a nuclear arm power __PUNCT__
just not go to happen __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as i mention earlier in thi connect __PUNCT__ we will also make certain that we do everyth we can to keep pakistan stabl __PUNCT__ both with regard to the fact that thei have nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ we want to make sure thei secur __PUNCT__
we will do everyth we can to make sure stabil is maintain in pakistan __PUNCT__ work with them __PUNCT__
and work with them to put them on a road to democraci as quickli as possibl becaus thi is what the terrorist in part were try to interrupt __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__ noth troubl them more than democraci __PUNCT__ and democraci is not just elect your leader __PUNCT__
democraci is respect for human right __PUNCT__
respect for the right of women __PUNCT__
respect for religi freedom and religi toler __PUNCT__
just think of all that __PUNCT__
all those principl undercut what their __PUNCT__ i hesit to sai principl ar __PUNCT__ their ideal ar __PUNCT__
everi singl on of them is contrari to what thei believ __PUNCT__ and that why thi whole idea of democraci is such a challeng to them __PUNCT__ and that why thi whole idea of democraci is such a good answer to them __PUNCT__ becaus when peopl start to feel democraci __PUNCT__ when thei start to feel that thei have the right to elect their leader __PUNCT__ thei have the right to choos who is go to govern them __PUNCT__ thei have control over their live __PUNCT__ peopl inevit move toward that __PUNCT__
it catch on __PUNCT__
it like a tidal wave or a tip point that ha to occur __PUNCT__
and thei veri awar of that __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we need to focu on pakistan __PUNCT__ make sure that it stabl __PUNCT__ but also make sure that it move toward democraci without ani signific interrupt __PUNCT__ becaus that will also help to defeat the terrorist in their goal __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and we need to rebuild our human intellig capabl __PUNCT__
we need a new __PUNCT__ focus __PUNCT__ small and well __PUNCT__ train unit of highli paid __PUNCT__ an elit corp that call __PUNCT__ whose job would be to penetr terrorist group __PUNCT__
i don't know what go on insid the cia or the nation intellig agenc now __PUNCT__
i knew more about it when i wa in govern __PUNCT__
but the first thing i would check on is to see what progress have we made in human intellig becaus i believ that that on of the thing that ha to be rebuilt so that all thi technolog inform or technolog __PUNCT__ base inform we get start to make more sens __PUNCT__
you can get __PUNCT__ as loui __PUNCT__ freeh __PUNCT__ know __PUNCT__ you can get that much inform in a dai __PUNCT__ i probabl not even exagger __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ the kei to it is to know in advanc what import in that inform __PUNCT__
after the act take place __PUNCT__ we can go back over that inform and you can start point out the memo that would have alert you to the act __PUNCT__ but the real scienc here is be abl to do it befor the fact __PUNCT__
and the wai you go to do that much more easili is if you have realli solid human intellig __PUNCT__
so that would be on of the first thing that i would assur __PUNCT__ that we ar reestablish our human intellig base __PUNCT__
i know we said we were __PUNCT__ and i veri hope that we have __PUNCT__ but i would make sure that we ar __PUNCT__
and then it time now __PUNCT__ becaus it been in effect for a while __PUNCT__ to evalu the effect of the offic of director of nation intellig __PUNCT__ to ensur that it ha the proper author it need and that it is in fact facilit the free flow of inform __PUNCT__ which we know in the past ha at time been a problem __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ rebuild our militari __PUNCT__ rebuild our intellig servic __PUNCT__
those ar two of the kei compon __PUNCT__
the third on is in make sure that we improv homeland secur __PUNCT__
america ha __NUM__ local law enforc offic __PUNCT__ trooper __PUNCT__ local polic offic __PUNCT__ state polic offic __PUNCT__
thei ar our first respond along with our firefight __PUNCT__ we know that __PUNCT__ we all know that __PUNCT__
but in thi new ag __PUNCT__ we have to conceptu them differ as well __PUNCT__ and thei have an increas respons __PUNCT__
thei ar now our first prevent __PUNCT__
thei ar the peopl who will gather the inform that will alert us __PUNCT__ possibl __PUNCT__ to a terrorist strike __PUNCT__
r.p __PUNCT__ eddi of the manhattan institut first describ thi new role as __PUNCT__ first prevent __PUNCT__ and that is a new role for our polic and for our local law enforc peopl __PUNCT__
i propos a terrorstat program base on an analysi done by chief bratton and professor kell __PUNCT__ and the terrorstat program is someth that we would develop __PUNCT__
thei written about it __PUNCT__
and the idea of it is to make sure that local and state author across the countri ar abl to get the inform that thei need about suspici incid __PUNCT__ about precursor crime __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we also establish an intern assembl for freedom from terror to make sure the unit state is cooper internation and everybodi cooper with us __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the inform exist to alert us to a terrorist attack __PUNCT__ it out there __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ ar we pick it up through real intellig or through surveil and then ar we give these vast intric connect __PUNCT__ ar we share it well enough so it get to the right place at the right time and we will make sure that that is be done with the terrorstat program __PUNCT__ with the other program that we talk about some of which ar in exist and some of which have to be improv __PUNCT__
the whole idea is to make certain that we predict these attack in advanc __PUNCT__ that is the best wai to protect american live __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ we have to win the war of idea __PUNCT__
we have to win peopl heart and mind __PUNCT__
that part of thi as well __PUNCT__ which make thi whole effort complic but not more complic than what we face in the past __PUNCT__
dure the cold war we had to do the same thing __PUNCT__
we had to undermin and delegitim the ideolog of commun and promot the idea of freedom __PUNCT__
and now we got to do the same thing with thi terrorist ideolog __PUNCT__
we got to get peopl to understand how danger it is __PUNCT__ where it lead __PUNCT__ how it lead to destruct __PUNCT__ how it lead to harm for human be and we have to prevent the futur rise of terrorist __PUNCT__
i think that it also import to make sure that we tie our foreign aid __PUNCT__ where we can and where it should be ti __PUNCT__ to countri help us in the terrorist __PUNCT__ war against us and the countri help us not just in militari action __PUNCT__ but let think of it as an educ effort and an effort of have closer ti between those countri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we have to be more aggress about end illeg terrorist propaganda and we have to go after the monei __PUNCT__ rememb how effect that wa with the mafia __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ we got to go after the monei that thei have and cut off their resourc and if we can do that i believ that is go to help to a veri larg extent to start drive them back __PUNCT__
then we should develop and modern surrog like radio free europ __PUNCT__ and radio liberti that were us veri effect in the past __PUNCT__
we got to develop organ like thi so that we can get inform to peopl in place where thei ar be oppress so thei can understand what at stake for them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and final __PUNCT__ we should increas trade and cultur exchang with countri in these area of the world __PUNCT__
there no reason why our arm can't be open to do more busi with __PUNCT__ to have more cultur exchang with all the countri in the middl east __PUNCT__ counti in the arab world __PUNCT__ countri in the muslim world __PUNCT__
we have a lot to learn about each other and almost all of it is good __PUNCT__ in fact none of it is bad __PUNCT__ becaus the onli part that is bad is the part involv these terrorist who have pervert a religion __PUNCT__ all the rest of it __PUNCT__ believ me we the same peopl __PUNCT__ we realli ar __PUNCT__
the same desir for a better life for our famili and for our children __PUNCT__ same desir for peac __PUNCT__ same desir for good educ __PUNCT__ these ar univers thing __PUNCT__
if we have cultur exchang and we do more busi with each other we find out about these thing in less than a theoret wai but in a real wai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ in short those ar the thing that have to be done __PUNCT__ there ar a lot more __PUNCT__ i tri to outlin it as briefli as i could __PUNCT__ it a big subject __PUNCT__ win the terrorist __PUNCT__ war on us __PUNCT__
but it encompass militari __PUNCT__ it encompass local law enforc and nation law enforc __PUNCT__ it encompass intellig __PUNCT__ it encompass trade and cultur exchang __PUNCT__ it encompass a whole outreach to the rest of the world __PUNCT__
now thei go to be some peopl that ar go to look at my plan particularli with regard to increas the size of the militari __PUNCT__ and thei mai woe that strength provok conflict __PUNCT__ but histori teach us that just the opposit is true doesn't it __PUNCT__ it teach us __PUNCT__ here in thi museum __PUNCT__ world war ii museum __PUNCT__ if we learn the lesson of world war ii __PUNCT__ weak is what invit aggress __PUNCT__ not strength __PUNCT__
and we should have learn that even well befor world war ii __PUNCT__
georg washington told us more than __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ there is noth so like to produc peac as to be well __PUNCT__ prepar to meet an enemi __PUNCT__ that so veri close to what ronald reagan also taught us __PUNCT__
he said it two decad ago when he advoc __PUNCT__ peac through strength __PUNCT__ that why he had the confid to lead us through and to win the cold war __PUNCT__
what peopl us to ask ronald reagan __PUNCT__ becaus that cold war wa a frustrat war __PUNCT__ and thei us to ask ronald reagan __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
presid __PUNCT__ when is the cold war go to end __PUNCT__ when is it go to end __PUNCT__ he would just stand there with that confid wai that he had with a smile and sai __PUNCT__ thei lose __PUNCT__ we win __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that the approach that we have to have __PUNCT__
we have to have confid in ourselv __PUNCT__ we have to have confid in our idea __PUNCT__ we have to have confid in what we can achiev __PUNCT__ but meet thi challeng __PUNCT__ believ me __PUNCT__ is not option __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ thi is a war on us __PUNCT__
thei ar stare us in the ey __PUNCT__ and i refus to look the other wai __PUNCT__
real leader confront realiti with strength and confid __PUNCT__ not with denial __PUNCT__
and thi should be someth that unit the world __PUNCT__
it should be someth that bring good peopl togeth __PUNCT__ across our countri and around the world __PUNCT__ all togeth __PUNCT__
becaus terror victim peopl of all differ religion __PUNCT__ all differ race __PUNCT__ and all differ background __PUNCT__
it isn't focus on just on group of peopl __PUNCT__
it focus on innoc peopl and we should be unit in our respons to it __PUNCT__
liber and conserv __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ peopl of all differ religion __PUNCT__ we all affect by thi __PUNCT__
all of us have lost peopl to terror in ani of these group that we talk about __PUNCT__
our differ ar small in comparison to the danger we face __PUNCT__
we mai disagre on some of the detail of domest polici __PUNCT__ but we sure can agre that the greatest threat right now to our life __PUNCT__ our liberti __PUNCT__ and our pursuit of happi is thi threat __PUNCT__ thi existenti threat that we face __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i want our nation to be as unit as it wa in those week after the attack of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
rememb how unit we were then __PUNCT__ i want us to har that same strength __PUNCT__
not becaus we respond to grief __PUNCT__ although we still have tremend grief __PUNCT__ but becaus we recogn our uniti of purpos __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ there were time on that dai where i sure all of us had doubt __PUNCT__ could we get through thi __PUNCT__ could we handl thi __PUNCT__
i came to thi museum in part todai becaus thought of world war ii and the greatest gener were in my mind that dai __PUNCT__
i had just read tom brokaw book that summer __PUNCT__
and in read hi book i had wonder __PUNCT__ doe thi gener have the same strength that that gener had if we were to be requir to go through someth like thei went through __PUNCT__ do we have that strength __PUNCT__ do we have that strength of purpos and that union of spirit __PUNCT__ and i tell you the thing that convinc me of that __PUNCT__ immedi __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ see the construct worker and the peopl who volunt and the tremend strength in their face and their bodi and their desir to come and help and take whatev risk wa necessari __PUNCT__
but then the on that sort of encapsul it forev wa the firefight put up the flag right at ground zero __PUNCT__ over and abov what wa below them __PUNCT__
it look so much like iwo jima __PUNCT__
it look so much like what the marin had done in the second world war that i said to myself __PUNCT__ and have never doubt it sinc then __PUNCT__ that thi gener is as strong __PUNCT__ is as patriot __PUNCT__ is as determin __PUNCT__ and is just as capabl of meet thi challeng and prevail __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that our great test __PUNCT__
all of us __PUNCT__
it a test that unit us __PUNCT__ it a test that bring us togeth __PUNCT__ it a test that we will pass __PUNCT__
becaus know thi __PUNCT__ if you look at the lesson of histori __PUNCT__ peopl who live in freedom prevail over oppress __PUNCT__
that is the stori of the old testament __PUNCT__
that the histori of america __PUNCT__
that the stori of the second world war __PUNCT__
that the stori of the cold war __PUNCT__
and that will be the stori of thi war on us __PUNCT__
we will win it __PUNCT__
we will prevail __PUNCT__
and we will be abl to hand over to our children exactli what we ar suppos to hand over to our children __PUNCT__ a countri that improv __PUNCT__ a countri that stronger __PUNCT__ and a countri and world that is safer __PUNCT__
that is what an elect is all about __PUNCT__ choos someon who can bring us to those result __PUNCT__
i ask for your support __PUNCT__ i ask for your help __PUNCT__ i ask for your vote becaus i believ i am the best prepar to accomplish that import purpos __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
