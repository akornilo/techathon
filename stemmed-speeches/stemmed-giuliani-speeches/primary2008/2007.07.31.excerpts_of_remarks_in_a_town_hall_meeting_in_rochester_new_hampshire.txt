so i go to talk __PUNCT__ about healthcar and how we can realli veri __PUNCT__ veri much chang the whole wai in which we view healthcar in thi countri __PUNCT__ and solv the problem of out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ control lack of access __PUNCT__
the wai we have to do it is the american wai __PUNCT__
and that realli import __PUNCT__ and i have to emphas that __PUNCT__
we got to do it the american wai __PUNCT__
the american wai is not singl __PUNCT__ payer __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ control anyth __PUNCT__
that a european wai of do someth __PUNCT__
that a __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ a socialist wai of do it __PUNCT__
that why when you hear democrat in particular talk about singl __PUNCT__ payer __PUNCT__ mandat healthcar __PUNCT__ univers healthcar __PUNCT__ what thei talk about is social medicin __PUNCT__
thei talk about singl __PUNCT__ payer __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ control your healthcar decis __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so how do we fix healthcar __PUNCT__ the american wai __PUNCT__
not the french wai __PUNCT__ not the english wai __PUNCT__ not the cuban wai __PUNCT__ not the canadian wai __PUNCT__
how do we fix it the american wai __PUNCT__ and make it work better for everybodi __PUNCT__ how do we make it work for more peopl __PUNCT__ work better __PUNCT__ and work cheaper __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ there onli on wai to do that __PUNCT__
there onli on wai to make someth cheaper and better __PUNCT__
it call a larg consum market __PUNCT__
that the onli wai you can do it __PUNCT__
got to have privat ownership __PUNCT__
all of us have to take a littl bit more control __PUNCT__
each on of us can make a contribut by take a littl more control of our healthcar __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so here what i would do __PUNCT__
i would try to urg as mani american as possibl to go bui their own health insur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ what i recommend is that we give a big incent for american __PUNCT__ right at the veri begin __PUNCT__ to go get their own health insur __PUNCT__
how do you do it __PUNCT__ you creat a __MONEY__ tax exempt for a famili __PUNCT__
__MONEY__ for a singl individu __PUNCT__
that could be convert into a famili when a person get marri __PUNCT__ start to have children __PUNCT__
you get that write __PUNCT__ off on your tax right off the top __PUNCT__
if you go bui a health polici __PUNCT__ if you can go find on for __MONEY__ let sai __PUNCT__ that meet your need __PUNCT__ then you get __MONEY__ in tax __PUNCT__ free monei for yourself __PUNCT__
you keep that __PUNCT__
put it in a health save account __PUNCT__
that could be convert to a pension account __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ over a lifetim __PUNCT__ thi could be an enorm amount of monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ he idea is that peopl will have an incent to bui their own health insur __PUNCT__
thei get a big tax deduct for it __PUNCT__ thei get room for a health save account __PUNCT__ and as that health save account grow __PUNCT__ you can start think of a higher and higher deduct __PUNCT__ which mean you can take the premium down even further __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ when you do that __PUNCT__ you help everybodi els __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ becaus you drive the price down for everybodi els __PUNCT__
if on person doe it __PUNCT__ that help __PUNCT__
if two do it __PUNCT__ it help even more __PUNCT__
if a hundr do it __PUNCT__ it help a lot __PUNCT__
if a thousand do it __PUNCT__ a million do it __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ rememb __PUNCT__ the peopl that don't have health insur ar not the poorest of the poor __PUNCT__ by and larg __PUNCT__
the poorest of the poor have medicaid __PUNCT__
the peopl that don't have health insur ar the peopl who ar unlucki enough to be in that sort of middl __PUNCT__ or that gap __PUNCT__
so thei have some resourc __PUNCT__ it just that health insur is too darn expens for those resourc to mean anyth __PUNCT__
so the job that we have to do for all american is to bring down the cost of health insur __PUNCT__ and find an honest __PUNCT__ real market __PUNCT__ like thei did for televis and ipod and telephon __PUNCT__
deal with it the american wai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i am veri concern that we shrink the medic profess in thi countri __PUNCT__ and we shrink the medic profess in thi countri becaus we sue them so much __PUNCT__
out of control __PUNCT__
wai out of control __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ thi is what happen to the medic profess __PUNCT__
we have __PUNCT__ we have state in which women can't find ob __PUNCT__ gyn __PUNCT__
i go around thi countri and there ar place in which women can't find a doctor to deliv their babi __PUNCT__ becaus it is so darn expens just to begin an ob __PUNCT__ gyn practic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so we have to straighten out our legal system __PUNCT__
that is an enorm expens on our healthcar __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in short __PUNCT__ to sum up __PUNCT__ the whole purpos of thi is __PUNCT__ we got to solv our healthcar problem with american principl __PUNCT__ not with principl of social __PUNCT__
and i know my good friend the democrat will sai that __PUNCT__ it unfair to sai it social medicin __PUNCT__
but i a realist __PUNCT__
i face realiti __PUNCT__
that what it is __PUNCT__
if you take more peopl __PUNCT__ have the govern cover it __PUNCT__ it is call social medicin __PUNCT__
that what it is __PUNCT__
go look at the other countri who do it __PUNCT__ who have the singl __PUNCT__ payer system __PUNCT__
look at their experi with it __PUNCT__
and do you know what thei do __PUNCT__ thei chang to our kind of system __PUNCT__ becaus thei ar in ruin with thi __PUNCT__ with the system thei have __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i don't care what michael moor sai in hi movi __PUNCT__
i have had lot of peopl ask me for help in find hospit and doctor __PUNCT__ particularli for cancer __PUNCT__
i had lot of peopl ask me that __PUNCT__
and i had some peopl from europ ask me that __PUNCT__ to get help to come into an american hospit __PUNCT__
i never had anybodi ask me for help to get into a cuban hospit or a canadian hospit or an english hospit __PUNCT__
thei all want to come to america __PUNCT__
so let take what right about our system and let improv it __PUNCT__
