if you think that __PUNCT__ just read ani new york time editori while i wa mayor of new york citi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i protect the valu that we share just like i protect america from the enemi that we face __PUNCT__ becaus i find myself too often fail to reach the ideal of my religi and moral belief __PUNCT__
i don't easili publicli proclaim myself as the best exampl of faith __PUNCT__
possibl becaus i grew up in an environ where faith wa consid __PUNCT__ if not privat __PUNCT__ at least separ from polit life __PUNCT__
there a certain reluct that i have and i kind of grew up with to discuss it in detail in polit environ __PUNCT__
but my belief in god and relianc on hi guidanc is at the core of who i am __PUNCT__
i can assur you of that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ isn't it better that i tell you what i realli believ instead of pretend to chang all of my posit to fit the prevail wind __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i believ trust is more import than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ agreement __PUNCT__

ronald reagan look into hi heart __PUNCT__ hi mind __PUNCT__ hi belief __PUNCT__ and he ask the question __PUNCT__
the question wa what i do honestli believ is best for america __PUNCT__ some time that wa popular __PUNCT__ sometim that wa unpopular __PUNCT__
but ronald reagan wa a leader __PUNCT__
see if i come out here and i take a poll and i try to figur out what you all believ and then i just repeat to you what you all believ __PUNCT__ then i a follow __PUNCT__
i mai be a good actor if i do it well __PUNCT__ but i a follow __PUNCT__
what you entitl to from me is what i realli believ __PUNCT__ the sum total of my intellect __PUNCT__ my experi __PUNCT__ my educ __PUNCT__ my conscienc __PUNCT__ my heart __PUNCT__ my mind __PUNCT__ and then you have a right to agre with that __PUNCT__ disagre with it __PUNCT__ partial agre __PUNCT__ partial disagre and then figur out if i the right person for you to support __PUNCT__
but for me to twist myself all up to try to figur out exactli what you want to hear and todai sai on thing and the next dai anoth thing and a year from now __PUNCT__ if you do that too long __PUNCT__ you lose the sens of what leadership is all about __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ ronald reagan had a great wai of summar it __PUNCT__

with me __PUNCT__ you go to alwai know where i stand __PUNCT__
you will alwai know that i will not bend and swai with the polit wind if thei conflict with what i believ is right for our nation __PUNCT__
and i see clearli the valu of peopl of faith form the polit debat with their idea and ideal __PUNCT__
never let anyon tell you that your faith should not be part of your polit valu __PUNCT__
that a feat up for you to decid __PUNCT__
our constitut is not antagonist to religion or faith or god __PUNCT__
it ha two principl __PUNCT__ both of them entir consist with on nation under god __PUNCT__
a prohibit against the establish of religion and an equal strong prohibit against govern interfer in the free exercis of religion __PUNCT__
when you read those two togeth __PUNCT__ these guarante make clear that our found father want to have a nation where peopl of faith could freeli practic their faith as openli as thei want to __PUNCT__ proclaim their faith as strongli as thei would like to __PUNCT__ and it could be as much a part of the polit debat as individu mind and heart direct __PUNCT__

that it is their role to determin what other peopl meant when thei wrote the word for our constitut or the law __PUNCT__ not what thei would like it to mean __PUNCT__
to understand how deepli felt thi is __PUNCT__ look at the member of my judici advisori board __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that why we have to stand by our alli includ israel __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ what the commun of faith understand is that israel is on of our most faith alli __PUNCT__ but also that israel is the birthplac for jewish religion __PUNCT__ the christian religion __PUNCT__ of our tradit __PUNCT__
it the birthplac of a religion that gave us the teach of the bibl __PUNCT__ that gave us the teach of the prophet of old and the revel of the word of god __PUNCT__
the next presid need to have learn the lesson from the past and the mistak that were made in the negoti with yasser arafat __PUNCT__ which i believ were terribl mistaken and went veri much in the wrong direct __PUNCT__
if israel is to have a true peac it will onli be achiev if the palestinian accomplish these three thing __PUNCT__
