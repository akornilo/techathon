thei ar look for thi __PUNCT__
in the past __PUNCT__ befor __DATE__ __PUNCT__ thei weren't on offens __PUNCT__ becaus we hadn't had the attack of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ so hindsight doe help here __PUNCT__
but the realiti is that there ar peopl in america who don't realiz now how seriou thi threat is __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we have to remain on offens __PUNCT__
it mai also make it clear to us that thi terrorist war against us __PUNCT__ or our be on offens against them __PUNCT__ is not just a polit issu for on side or the other __PUNCT__ it a realiti that we live with __PUNCT__ we go to live with for quit some time __PUNCT__
so that we have to remain on offens __PUNCT__ we need thing like the patriot act __PUNCT__ we need thing like electron surveil __PUNCT__ it ha to be legal __PUNCT__ but we need it __PUNCT__
we need thing like interrog techniqu to get inform from peopl __PUNCT__ legal again __PUNCT__ but it ha to be aggress __PUNCT__
these ar the thing that keep us safe in a world where there ar more than a few peopl organ around islam terrorist who want to harm us and to kill us __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ do you think we do enough __PUNCT__ do you think our immigr polici is tough enough __PUNCT__ on of the suspect is not a unit state citizen and he an employe at jfk airport __PUNCT__
giuliani __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i would sai that __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ the author involv in thi investig __PUNCT__ it look like it been go on for quit some time __PUNCT__ have my admir __PUNCT__
i did that work for a lot of my life __PUNCT__
i did that kind of work for a lot more of my life than anyth els __PUNCT__ even be mayor of new york __PUNCT__
i wa involv as an assist unit state attornei __PUNCT__ a unit state attornei __PUNCT__ and that veri tough __PUNCT__ difficult work __PUNCT__ and thei did an absolut great job __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ attornei in brooklyn in thi case __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ attornei in new jersei a coupl of week ago __PUNCT__ the fbi __PUNCT__ polic __PUNCT__
the immigr polici in the unit state need to be chang __PUNCT__ and i veri disappoint that the legisl thei discuss doesn't accomplish it __PUNCT__
all the debat __PUNCT__ all the discuss __PUNCT__ all the fight that goe on __PUNCT__ here what ha to be accomplish __PUNCT__ it real simpl __PUNCT__
and thi is from someon where secur ha been a lot bigger part of my life than polit __PUNCT__
we need to know everyon who in the unit state from a foreign countri __PUNCT__
the unit state need to have that inform __PUNCT__
other countri have that inform __PUNCT__
we entitl to that inform __PUNCT__
it is possibl __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ to acquir it __PUNCT__
credit card compani track more inform than that __PUNCT__ by a lot __PUNCT__
and the wai to do that is to have a tamper proof id card in which peopl ar identifi __PUNCT__ biometr identifi __PUNCT__ fingerprint __PUNCT__ photograph __PUNCT__
everi singl person that in thi countri from a foreign countri __PUNCT__ the object is to have them in a databas __PUNCT__
that the reason why we need a fenc __PUNCT__ that the reason why we need a technolog fenc __PUNCT__ in order to determin peopl come across our border that we not find out about __PUNCT__
that why we need a borderstat program that i talk about a coupl of dai ago in which we evalu our success __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ the peopl who ar identifi will all pai tax __PUNCT__ will all pai their fair share __PUNCT__ and the peopl who don't have the id card and aren't identifi __PUNCT__ those ar the peopl we throw out of the countri __PUNCT__
and if we can narrow thi larg group that we deal with to a smaller group __PUNCT__ we go to be far more effect in find the terrorist __PUNCT__ the drug dealer __PUNCT__
when the pool of peopl that ar in thi illeg categori is so larg it an invit to terrorist and drug dealer and crimin to hide __PUNCT__
if you can narrow that pool to a much more defin group of peopl and distinguish between those that ar identifi and have the id card __PUNCT__ and ar comfort with the idea that thei here and thei here for good purpos __PUNCT__ and then the peopl who don't have it __PUNCT__ those ar the peopl you focu on and you throw them out of the countri __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ should citizen have to carri that kind of id card __PUNCT__ giuliani __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thi is for peopl that come from a foreign countri __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of suggest about social secur card and make them tamper proof and for everyon els __PUNCT__ but thi is a program that should exist for peopl that come here from a foreign countri so that we get __PUNCT__ see the problem with the legisl that exist now __PUNCT__ thi is __PUNCT__ you know thei sai ani program written by a committe __PUNCT__ or ani speech or book written by a committe is like inconsist __PUNCT__ thi is an inconsist program __PUNCT__
there ar part of it that ar good __PUNCT__ there ar part of it that ar bad __PUNCT__ there ar part of it you can't figur out how thing could actual be wors __PUNCT__
it becaus it ha no unifi purpos __PUNCT__
the unifi purpos of it should be that we ar abl to identifi all the peopl that ar in thi countri and thei have a tamper proof id card __PUNCT__
if you can accomplish that __PUNCT__ then a lot of the other issu __PUNCT__ who get to work __PUNCT__ what thei have to do if thei work __PUNCT__ how we deal with peopl that ar here and want to becom citizen so thei don't get ahead of peopl that ar legal and still have some opportun __PUNCT__ all those thing could work themselv out __PUNCT__
