how about be __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ we can reform educ __PUNCT__ primari and secondari educ in thi countri and we can do it by creat and expand school choic __PUNCT__
we empow parent __PUNCT__ not govern bureaucrat __PUNCT__ let the parent choos where their child goe to school __PUNCT__

of cours we need a level plai field __PUNCT__ but we should be less concern about how much we bui from oversea __PUNCT__ except from the point of view of safeti and secur __PUNCT__ that import __PUNCT__
but on the econom of it __PUNCT__ what we should realli be focus on is how much do we sell to oversea __PUNCT__ america is an entrepreneuri societi __PUNCT__
we should view the rise of china and india __PUNCT__ the peopl move out of poverti in china and india __PUNCT__ we should view that as a great opportun to find what america is alwai look for __PUNCT__ new custom __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ when thei think of us as a countri that militarist __PUNCT__ thei wrong __PUNCT__
the essenti natur of american is not war __PUNCT__

there ar a few peopl and more than a few but by no mean anyth close to a substanti proport of peopl __PUNCT__ that have pervert the think and turn it into a polit ideolog now of hatr and anger and vicious and aggress __PUNCT__
but that shouldn't stop us from reach out to all of the rest of those peopl who have the same desir that we have __PUNCT__
we should actual be have more contact with __PUNCT__ do more busi with __PUNCT__ have more cultur relationship with the middl east now than we have ever had befor __PUNCT__

that the same strength that in each of us __PUNCT__
we inherit it __PUNCT__ we have it __PUNCT__
