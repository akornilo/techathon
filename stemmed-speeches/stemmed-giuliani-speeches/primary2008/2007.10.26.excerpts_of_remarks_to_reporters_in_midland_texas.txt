__PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ think the presid and secretari of state and secretari of treasuri of the unit state govern made the right decis in increas the sanction on iran __PUNCT__
thei import step in the right direct __PUNCT__
i understand that some of the democrat ar critic that becaus somehow i get the feel that no matter what the presid sai thei would critic it __PUNCT__
but i think all american agre that we have to stop iran from becom a nuclear power __PUNCT__ and i think it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__ to design these two organ terrorist organ to try to cut off the bank __PUNCT__ to try to cut off signific fund __PUNCT__ to try to marshal other countri in the world to help us __PUNCT__
i think all american should be behind thi __PUNCT__
thi will make our world safer if we can keep iran from be a nuclear power __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think the presid ha made clear __PUNCT__ and i agre with it __PUNCT__ that the militari option is not off the tabl __PUNCT__
these sanction do not suggest that at all __PUNCT__ but what thei do suggest is we would rather find anoth wai to accomplish thi __PUNCT__
it would be a lot safer __PUNCT__
it would be a lot better for all of us __PUNCT__
it the presid desir __PUNCT__ it be my desir that iran understand the implic of what thei do __PUNCT__
i think these sanction ar go to make that point veri __PUNCT__ veri clearli __PUNCT__
mayb thei appeal to other peopl in iran other than ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ who appear to be extrem unreason __PUNCT__ but there have been time in the past where sanction have work and time when thei haven't __PUNCT__ so let hope thi is on of those time where sanction work __PUNCT__
but certainli thi is the right cours of action to take __PUNCT__
but the militari option is not off the tabl and the iranian should understand that __PUNCT__ that america will not allow them to becom a nuclear power __PUNCT__
their regim is too irrespons __PUNCT__
the world would be in too much danger __PUNCT__
