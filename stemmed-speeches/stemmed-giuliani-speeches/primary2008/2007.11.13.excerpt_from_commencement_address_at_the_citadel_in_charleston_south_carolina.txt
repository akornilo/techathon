as i said befor __PUNCT__ america love peac and we hate war __PUNCT__
that honor instinct ha meant that sometim in our histori we wait too long to mobil our arm forc to face the world danger __PUNCT__
sometim we often demobil too rapidli onc we think we achiev victori and the danger is gone __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ after the first world war __PUNCT__ the size of the armi after we had the war to end war __PUNCT__ the size of our armi wa cut by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
it meant that we weren't abl to face nazism at an earli enough stage and then we had to plai catch up in the first year of the second world war to our disadvantag __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ after we won the second world war we did it again __PUNCT__
an armi of seven million soldier were reduc to __NUM__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but when the cold war turn out hot with the invas of south korea __PUNCT__ harri truman __PUNCT__ a democrat presid __PUNCT__ and a republican congress __PUNCT__ work togeth for the good of our countri had to commit our countri to maintain the largest peac time militari for the first time in our histori __PUNCT__

washington wa full of talk about a peac dividend __PUNCT__
the peac dividend becam govern polici __PUNCT__
i oppos the peac dividend then and i oppos it now __PUNCT__
the damag that it ha done to our militari and intellig servic ha yet to be complet undon __PUNCT__
histori ha alreadi shown that the peac dividend wa on of our countri worst mistak __PUNCT__
we were slash our militari and intellig budget as the islam radic terrorist were commit act of war against us __PUNCT__ but we didn't see it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the first world trade center bomb wa not __PUNCT__ or attack __PUNCT__ wa not on __DATE__ __PUNCT__

then there wa khobar tower in __NUM__ the bomb of our embassi in kenya and tanzania in __NUM__ and the attack on the u.s. __PUNCT__ cole in __NUM__ that kill seventeen of our sailor __PUNCT__

an armi of eighteen divis wa slash to ten as the terrorist were declar war on us and attack us __PUNCT__
total man power wa reduc from __NUM__ in the earli __NUM__ to __NUM__ on the ev of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
refuel tanker so crucial to long rang oper that ar vital to deal with the terrorist who make war on us __PUNCT__ these ar now modifi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ a plane that last flew commerci in the unit state in __NUM__ befor most of you were born or i think ani of you were born __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ the idea of a peac dividend wa alwai intellectu flaw __PUNCT__ it wa also strateg flaw __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the pace of our arm forc oper have onli quicken sinc the cold war __PUNCT__
you ar ask to do much more in mani differ place and in much more complex situat __PUNCT__
if we ar go to ask our militari to do more __PUNCT__ we need to give them the resourc and the support to get the job done __PUNCT__
that our respons __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ at on time there wa the romant thought that america could be isol __PUNCT__
isol is no longer an option in the ag of global __PUNCT__
isol is no longer an option when there ar peopl in variou part of the world plan to come to harm you __PUNCT__
condit for our fight men and women have improv in recent year __PUNCT__
presid bush ha increas our militari strength and further increas ar plan __PUNCT__
but we need to do more __PUNCT__ much more __PUNCT__
we need a forc that can both deter aggress and meet mani challeng that might come our wai __PUNCT__
america must increas the size of our arm forc __PUNCT__ in particular we have to start with the armi which ha been cut the most and is under the greatest stress __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i believ america need at least ten new combat brigad abov the addit that ar alreadi propos by presid bush and ar alreadi in the budget __PUNCT__
thi commit would offer reinforc where thei ar need most __PUNCT__ deter other from calcul that america mai be stretch too thing __PUNCT__
it would be a terribl mistak for anyon to calcul that but let make sure thei don't by increas the size of our forc and allow the unit state greater flexibl to win the wider war of the terrorist against us __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in the past when america popul wa ten of million smaller than we ar now __PUNCT__ we easili maintain a larger armi and a larger arm forc than we have right now __PUNCT__
a volunt profession armi of citizen is our greatest sourc of strength and i believ that the 9/11 gener __PUNCT__ just like you have __PUNCT__ will step forward to meet thi challeng __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we must also look at the level of expans that necessari for our navi __PUNCT__ for our marin __PUNCT__ for our coast guard and for our air forc __PUNCT__
