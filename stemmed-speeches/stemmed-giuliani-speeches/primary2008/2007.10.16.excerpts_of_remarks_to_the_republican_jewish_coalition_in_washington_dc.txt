it isn't __PUNCT__
hezbollah kill more american than ani other terrorist group befor __DATE__ __PUNCT__

thei hijack a u. __PUNCT__ airplan and murder a u. __PUNCT__ navi __PUNCT__ diver __PUNCT__ robert stethem __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ __PUNCT__

thei seek out american __PUNCT__ thei seek out isra __PUNCT__ thei seek out those who ar alli to us __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ iran __PUNCT__ thi nation that been a rogu or run by a rogu regim now for sever decad __PUNCT__ is assist terrorist who ar kill american troop __PUNCT__
we seen what iran will do with ordinari weapon __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there ar peopl that sai that we have to accommod ourselv to a nuclear iran __PUNCT__
we can have someth like we had dure the cold war __PUNCT__
we can have some kind of accommod __PUNCT__
we can have mutual assur destruct or damag __PUNCT__
i read those articl in foreign polici magazin and on the editori page __PUNCT__ op __PUNCT__ ed page of newspap __PUNCT__ and i can see the movement kind of build for that __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what wa the worst nightmar of the cold war __PUNCT__ the worst nightmar of the cold war wa nuclear weapon fall into the hand of irrespons peopl __PUNCT__
in that respect __PUNCT__ we were fortun __PUNCT__
the soviet were horribl __PUNCT__
thei were __PUNCT__ as ronald reagan said __PUNCT__ an evil empir __PUNCT__
communist china __PUNCT__ no differ __PUNCT__
but at least in both of those situat __PUNCT__ there wa a residu self __PUNCT__ interest or you might even call it a residu ration that said __PUNCT__ we don't want to die __PUNCT__
we don't want to lose russia __PUNCT__ we don't want to lose china __PUNCT__
there too much at stake here __PUNCT__
the reason i come to the conclus that i do about iran is not out of ani desir to ever have to us american militari power __PUNCT__
i think anybodi who want to be presid of the unit state would sai a prayer at the begin that you would never have to us american militari power __PUNCT__
but a presid of the unit state can't hesit to do that if it in the best interest __PUNCT__ of the nation __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if we learn anyth from the __NUM__ centuri from deal with nazi __PUNCT__ communist __PUNCT__ and islam terrorist __PUNCT__ if you haven't learn thi lesson __PUNCT__ i don't think you live through the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ you have to stand up to dictat __PUNCT__ to tyrant __PUNCT__ to terrorist __PUNCT__
weak invit attack __PUNCT__

it shock that __NUM__ year after the holocaust __PUNCT__ the jewish peopl ar still requir to negoti for the right to exist __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ thi should be beyond negoti __PUNCT__
somedai i hope that jew and arab can sit down togeth to negoti border __PUNCT__ water __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__
it go to happen __PUNCT__ but it go to happen more quickli if we remain strong and we remain realli __PUNCT__ realli clear __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ you cannot negoti with someon who is threaten to destroi you and your famili __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ thi is the great fallaci in thi now veri strong democrat desir to negoti __PUNCT__ negoti __PUNCT__ negoti and negoti __PUNCT__
you got to know with whom to negoti and with whom you should not negoti __PUNCT__
when barack obama __PUNCT__ a coupl of month ago __PUNCT__ said that he would invit ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ assad __PUNCT__ castro and chavez __PUNCT__ did i miss somebodi __PUNCT__ to washington in the first year that he in offic to meet with them __PUNCT__ without precondit __PUNCT__ when he wa condemn by hillari clinton __PUNCT__ who now ha join hi posit __PUNCT__ but that wa the on of the longest posit she held __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__
she held that on for two month __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that on she held for two month __PUNCT__
but at that time __PUNCT__ she said he wa wrong __PUNCT__
that the first time i agre with her sinc the time that she announc she wa a yanke fan __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now she taken the rug out from under my feet __PUNCT__
but he announc that he go to negoti with these peopl without precondit and then he went on to explain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ ronald reagan negoti with the communist __PUNCT__
i sai thi most respectfulli __PUNCT__
you not ronald reagan __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ here is what ronald reagan did befor he negoti with the communist __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ he call them the evil empir __PUNCT__
then he took missil __PUNCT__ intermedi rang missil __PUNCT__
i know thi becaus i repres him in court when thi wa challeng __PUNCT__
and he point them __PUNCT__ he put them in european citi and he point the missil at russian citi with name on them and then he said __PUNCT__ in hi veri nice wai __PUNCT__ let negoti __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ when __PUNCT__ as sheldon mention __PUNCT__ i had yasser arafat thrown out of the unit nation __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that wa a freudian slip __PUNCT__
i didn't have him thrown out of the unit nation __PUNCT__
i had him thrown out of the unit nation __PUNCT__ concert at lincoln center __PUNCT__
i think it wa a freudian slip becaus you might have gotten the point of whether i realli would have like to have done __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i help to keep him awai from the unit nation in the 1980 __PUNCT__ but that a differ stori __PUNCT__
when i made that decis __PUNCT__ which had to be made right at the moment __PUNCT__ becaus i went out to give a curtain speech __PUNCT__ it wa for a perform of beethoven __NUM__ symphoni __PUNCT__ great work of art __PUNCT__ a great piec of music __PUNCT__ on that dedic to peac __PUNCT__ and i did find some real incongru in the idea that he wa come to that concert __PUNCT__
but the thing that realli bother me wa he didn't have a ticket __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he wa a freeload __PUNCT__
just like he stole all that monei and sent it to the south of franc __PUNCT__ he didn't pai for hi ticket __PUNCT__
but in serious __PUNCT__ the truth is i wa inform that he wa there and i had to go out and give a curtain speech __PUNCT__
i didn't hesit __PUNCT__ like hillari clinton hesit to answer question on what she go to do about iran __PUNCT__
i didn't seek to negoti with him __PUNCT__ like barack obama would do or sai he do with these peopl __PUNCT__
i didn't call for a team of lawyer to help me __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i didn't call for a team of lawyer to tell me __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ on the on hand __PUNCT__ you can throw him out __PUNCT__ but on the other hand __PUNCT__ you can't __PUNCT__ and mayb you can partial throw him out __PUNCT__
mayb we could have him sit like further up __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i just made a decis __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i lead __PUNCT__
that what __PUNCT__ be a __PUNCT__ leader is about __PUNCT__
a leader ha the confid to make a decis __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so the administr wa real angri at me __PUNCT__
presid clinton condemn me the next dai __PUNCT__
i frame the articl __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the unit nation __PUNCT__ the unit nation __PUNCT__ thei were go to condemn all of new york citi __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ for what i did __PUNCT__
but it turn __PUNCT__ i knew __PUNCT__ the reason i did it wa i knew from my own investig of arafat that he wa a murder and a terrorist __PUNCT__ that he had kill mani isra __PUNCT__ kill mani american citizen __PUNCT__
the case with leon klinghoff wa the on that probabl i knew the best __PUNCT__
and i also thought from the veri __PUNCT__ veri begin __PUNCT__ when thei first start negoti with him __PUNCT__ that thi whole idea of hold him on a moral equival plane to like the prime minist of israel __PUNCT__ like these two peopl ar equal __PUNCT__ wa a terribl __PUNCT__ terribl mistak and i believ that set back the whole caus of peac in the middl east __PUNCT__ mayb for at least a decad and mayb even longer __PUNCT__
i hope not __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ similarli __PUNCT__ that the reason i reject the __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
princ al __PUNCT__ wale came to ground zero __PUNCT__ like mani peopl did __PUNCT__
he came with a group __PUNCT__
it wa veri earli in the morn __PUNCT__
i wa ask by the state depart to take peopl there and the reason i think the state depart want me to do it wa becaus wa __PUNCT__ quit obvious __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ peopl were move by it and __PUNCT__ number two __PUNCT__ it might build support for what thei knew thei were go to have to do __PUNCT__
and i took mani __PUNCT__ mani leader and peopl there __PUNCT__ mani famili and other peopl __PUNCT__ and there not a singl person of ani polit persuas __PUNCT__ polit parti or whether you talk about head of state __PUNCT__ like putin or chirac __PUNCT__ or you talk just about ordinari peopl or children __PUNCT__ i didn't take on there that wasn't legitim move by it __PUNCT__
when i took al __PUNCT__ wale there and i stood there for a while and answer hi question __PUNCT__ i felt someth funni __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ it just a feel you get __PUNCT__
and when you deal with peopl as much as i have and you have __PUNCT__ you obvious get an instinct from them __PUNCT__
sometim your instinct ar right __PUNCT__
sometim your instinct ar wrong __PUNCT__
and when i left to go to a funer __PUNCT__ i almost felt bad and i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ mayb my instinct were wrong here __PUNCT__
he did come and he did give us a check for __MONEY__ million for the firefight __PUNCT__ and polic offic __PUNCT__ famili __PUNCT__ which is a wonder thing to do __PUNCT__
and then i went to the first funer __PUNCT__ and i don't rememb if it wa the second __PUNCT__ and i got a call from my press commun director __PUNCT__ sunni mindel __PUNCT__ and sunni said __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ wale did someth veri __PUNCT__ veri surpris __PUNCT__
he held a press confer after you left and he put out thi press releas and she read the press releas to me and basic __PUNCT__ as i recal the press releas now __PUNCT__ it said that __PUNCT__ in essenc __PUNCT__ america ha if not all __PUNCT__ some of the respons for the attack of __DATE__ becaus of the foreign polici that we pursu __PUNCT__
it mention some other particular __PUNCT__ but it said __PUNCT__ and becaus of our strong support for israel and that we should think of chang that __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ sunni __PUNCT__ i can't keep thi monei __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thi is exactli what wrong __PUNCT__
thi is thi moral equival __PUNCT__
israel not perfect and america not perfect __PUNCT__ but we not terrorist state and we decent countri that have the right motiv __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i be back in about an hour __PUNCT__ after i finish thi on more __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ funer and i said __PUNCT__ you know what i go to do __PUNCT__ it not my monei __PUNCT__
