giuliani __PUNCT__ i don't know if i __PUNCT__ schieffer __PUNCT__ __URL__ you made a mistak __PUNCT__
giuliani __PUNCT__ i would __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ __URL__ the wai you chose not to contest those earli __PUNCT__
giuliani __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ schieffer __PUNCT__ __URL__ giuliani __PUNCT__ i believ the best strategi for us wa on where we concentr on florida __PUNCT__ given all the pro and con of each on of our race and the asset that we had __PUNCT__ the resourc we had __PUNCT__
the best chanc we had wa here in florida __PUNCT__ and i think that go to be proven correct on tuesdai __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ why do you __PUNCT__ what do you attribut thi drop in the poll to __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ becaus if it wasn't a mistak in tactic __PUNCT__ it would suggest that the more peopl found out about you __PUNCT__ the more thei didn't like you __PUNCT__
giuliani __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ i think the realiti is __PUNCT__ of the peopl who won those primari __PUNCT__ thei got all the attent __PUNCT__
and now what we have to do is establish ourselv here in florida and show that we can win __PUNCT__
and that been the concentr that we had __PUNCT__
we unveil here our tax plan __PUNCT__ our plan for a singl on __PUNCT__ page tax form __PUNCT__
it actual alreadi been introduc in congress by congressman dreier and senat bond as legisl __PUNCT__
it would not onli be the largest tax cut in american histori __PUNCT__ it would __PUNCT__ it would provid a singl __PUNCT__ page tax form as an option __PUNCT__
on page in which you can fill out your tax __PUNCT__
so it would also be a tax simplif __PUNCT__ as well as a reform __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ you talk about cut tax as the wai to turn a govern around __PUNCT__
you said that what you did in new york __PUNCT__
but isn't that go to be kind of difficult with a war that cost __MONEY__ a minut __PUNCT__ with now a new stimulu packag that nobodi know how thei go to pai for that __PUNCT__ and now you propos thi catastroph insur fund __PUNCT__
how much would that cost __PUNCT__ mayor giuliani __PUNCT__ giuliani __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ could you pai for that and still cut tax __PUNCT__ giuliani __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
let __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ the tax cut plan is to cut tax that would rais revenu __PUNCT__
for __PUNCT__ when __PUNCT__ in new york citi __PUNCT__ i cut tax __PUNCT__ i cut the incom tax by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ i wa collect __NUM__ percent higher revenu from the lower tax than the higher tax __PUNCT__
a cut in the corpor tax __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ that we propos right now __PUNCT__ from __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ would mean more job __PUNCT__ more invest __PUNCT__ more revenu __PUNCT__
cut the capit gain tax __PUNCT__ you make monei __PUNCT__
so you have to look carefulli at these tax cut __PUNCT__
thei strateg tax cut that would actual bring you more revenu __PUNCT__
we also ar propos cut spend __PUNCT__ which hasn't gotten as much attent __PUNCT__
we would cut spend by not rehir half of the govern employe who ar come up for retir on the civilian side __PUNCT__ by put target on the civilian agenc of __NUM__ and __NUM__ percent reduct __PUNCT__
so it not just tax cut __PUNCT__ it also reduc expenditur where you can __PUNCT__
and the catastroph fund is a backup __PUNCT__
the govern is spend that monei anywai __PUNCT__
when a __PUNCT__ when a terribl catastroph take place __PUNCT__ like katrina or the four hurrican sever year ago here in florida __PUNCT__ the feder govern give out billion and billion and billion of dollar __PUNCT__
the idea here would be that the feder govern would be a backstop for a onc __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ hundr __PUNCT__ year or onc __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ gener catastroph so that peopl can get insur __PUNCT__
i learn that campaign in florida __PUNCT__
peopl here in florida ar have a realli difficult time get insur for their home __PUNCT__
some can't get it at all __PUNCT__ some can't afford it __PUNCT__ and some have to realli strain to do it __PUNCT__
so thi would allow them to get insur __PUNCT__ and then if __PUNCT__ god forbid __PUNCT__ there wa a catastroph like that __PUNCT__ you actual would have more privat monei involv in it __PUNCT__ more insur monei involv in it __PUNCT__ and peopl would get it faster __PUNCT__
i think it a prudent wai to do it __PUNCT__ and it a wai in which you get commun readi for whatev might happen to them __PUNCT__ which is part of homeland secur in the first place __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when thi came up at the congress __PUNCT__ senat mccain said __PUNCT__ put the cost at somewher around __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
did he know what he wa talk about __PUNCT__ giuliani __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ that the cost of what a catastroph sometim plai out as __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i think katrina __PUNCT__ correct me if i wrong __PUNCT__ but i think katrina ha alreadi involv about __NUM__ __MONEY__ billion in feder dollar __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ but the realiti is __PUNCT__ the feder govern spend that monei anywai __PUNCT__
it spend the monei after the fact __PUNCT__
so if it act as a backup befor the fact and privat insur can cover a lot of it __PUNCT__ in the long run it actual go to save monei __PUNCT__ not cost more monei __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__ yesterdai wa not a veri good dai for senat clinton __PUNCT__ that for sure __PUNCT__ but it also realli wasn't a veri good for you __PUNCT__ becaus the governor of florida __PUNCT__ who ha __NUM__ percent approv rate __PUNCT__ announc that he wa go to endors john mccain __PUNCT__
i think the dai befor __PUNCT__ the state republican senat __PUNCT__ mel martinez __PUNCT__ a former chairman of the republican nation committe __PUNCT__ surpris a lot of peopl __PUNCT__ especi mitt romnei __PUNCT__ who thought he wa go to get hi endors __PUNCT__ and he endors senat mccain __PUNCT__
and that come on the heel of your hometown newspap __PUNCT__ the new york time __PUNCT__ also endors senat mccain __PUNCT__
that put you in a pretti tough spot __PUNCT__ doesn't it __PUNCT__ giuliani __PUNCT__ the realiti is __PUNCT__ i wa surpris by the governor endors __PUNCT__ but everybodi endors __PUNCT__
the attornei gener __PUNCT__ bill mccollum __PUNCT__ a long __PUNCT__ time congressman here __PUNCT__ now attornei gener __PUNCT__ endors me __PUNCT__ is my campaign chairman __PUNCT__
we have a lot of support here in __PUNCT__ here in florida __PUNCT__ mayor and peopl up and down the state __PUNCT__
the realiti is __PUNCT__ i think the peopl of florida ar go to make thi decis __PUNCT__ and i think the peopl of florida see in me a proven tax cutter __PUNCT__ someon who actual turn an economi around __PUNCT__ actual done what thei would like to see done on a feder level __PUNCT__ i alreadi did that in new york __PUNCT__
and of all the candid that ar run in the race __PUNCT__ i the on who actual lower tax in the past and turn around an economi __PUNCT__
and i have a signific amount of experi with handl the safeti and secur of million of peopl __PUNCT__
i think if peopl of florida hear that __PUNCT__ that go to be the thing that decid thi elect __PUNCT__
we all have endors __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ attornei gener __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__ we all have differ endors __PUNCT__ but in the long run it get your messag to the peopl of florida that the most import thing __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ i want to give you a chanc to respond to that endors by the new york time __PUNCT__ becaus thei realli took after you __PUNCT__
thei said your arrog __PUNCT__ your vindict were __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ar breathtak __PUNCT__ in their phrase __PUNCT__
what do you sai about that when peopl ask you about that __PUNCT__ giuliani __PUNCT__ i wa a mayor of new york citi that i think brought about the biggest turnaround in the histori of the citi __PUNCT__
crime __PUNCT__ welfar __PUNCT__ the economi of the citi __PUNCT__ unemploy went from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ __NUM__ peopl remov from welfar __PUNCT__
i chang some of the rule __PUNCT__ some of the social norm __PUNCT__ some of the wai in which peopl look at thing __PUNCT__
the time oppos most of my initi __PUNCT__ thei saw them differ than i did __PUNCT__
so i wa not at all surpris by their lack of an endors or their endors __PUNCT__
i didn't expect it to go ani other wai __PUNCT__
most of __PUNCT__ most of my ideolog that i put into place in new york citi thei oppos __PUNCT__ includ the on we talk about most thi morn __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ larg tax cut __PUNCT__
but i truli believ that if you cut tax correctli __PUNCT__ you actual gain revenu and you gain revenu in a healthi wai __PUNCT__
you gain revenu by put more peopl to work __PUNCT__ by build busi __PUNCT__ build job __PUNCT__ and it a healthi wai for an economi to grow rather than heavi tax to transfer wealth __PUNCT__ which i think put a lid on an economi __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__ i want to wish you the veri best in that campaign on __PUNCT__
giuliani __PUNCT__ alwai a pleasur __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
