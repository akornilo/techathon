when thei sai thei ar go to revers the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ that translat into rais your tax anywher from twenti to twenti __PUNCT__ five percent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i believ in just the opposit __PUNCT__
i think we should maintain those tax cut __PUNCT__ i even think we should improv them becaus i have a veri __PUNCT__ veri strong __PUNCT__ not just belief __PUNCT__ but i have had experi do that __PUNCT__
and i don't think ani of my oppon ha had thi experi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i ran a govern for eight year __PUNCT__
i ran the third or fourth largest govern in the countri __PUNCT__
and i ran a govern that wa on of the most heavili tax in the countri __PUNCT__
new york citi ha tax you never heard of __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ w __PUNCT__ hile i wa the mayor i lower __NUM__ or limit __NUM__ differ tax __PUNCT__
who could possibl have __NUM__ differ tax but we did and i lower them dramat __PUNCT__
just for exampl the incom tax __PUNCT__ i lower the new york citi incom tax about __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
on quarter __PUNCT__ that a big reduct in the incom tax __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i want you to think about that __PUNCT__
democrat __PUNCT__ thei honestli don't understand thi __PUNCT__
thi is a major differ between us __PUNCT__
thei believ you got to rais tax to take in more monei for the govern __PUNCT__
the realiti is if you rais tax particularli in a societi that heavili tax you end up ultim take in less monei __PUNCT__ for the govern __PUNCT__
then you have to rais tax some more __PUNCT__
we been through that cycl befor and if you elect a democrat in __NUM__ you go to begin that cycl all over again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i do not understand why thei want to revers these tax cut __PUNCT__
i realli don't __PUNCT__
i don't understand why hillari clinton and john edward and barack obama kind of fall all over themselv tell you thei want to revers the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
here the simpl fact __PUNCT__ the simpl fact is we collect more monei from the lower tax than we us to collect from the clinton tax __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ had to assert fiscal disciplin in a place where it wa more difficult to do than washington d.c __PUNCT__
we lower tax __PUNCT__ we lower the rate of growth of govern __PUNCT__ we assert fiscal disciplin over the citi __PUNCT__ and the citi of new york __PUNCT__ to thi dai __PUNCT__ is continu to prosper __PUNCT__
