hope it hasn't hurt hi popular here in great britain __PUNCT__
but it shouldn't __PUNCT__
our relationship is much deeper than ani occasion disagr we mai have __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ tonight i go to be speak __PUNCT__ and it the main reason i came here __PUNCT__ to give the first lectur for the margaret thatcher seri and get an award from margaret thatcher __PUNCT__
that on of the strongest relationship that american presid and prime minist ever had __PUNCT__ between ronald reagan and margaret thatcher __PUNCT__
there a book __PUNCT__ pretti current now in the state __PUNCT__ that talk about margaret thatcher __PUNCT__ ronald reagan __PUNCT__ and pope john __PUNCT__ paul ii __PUNCT__ be the three primari peopl who revers commun __PUNCT__
brought down the soviet union __PUNCT__ the berlin wall __PUNCT__
that relationship led to a tremend amount of freedom and opportun for peopl who didn't know freedom and opportun befor __PUNCT__ at least for quit some time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think that the relationship between the unit state and the unit kingdom __PUNCT__ like the relationship between the unit state and europ __PUNCT__ ha to be base on veri fundament __PUNCT__ endur principl that bring us togeth __PUNCT__
if there ar occasion disagr we should see that as normal for democraci __PUNCT__
i mean after all __PUNCT__ ani disagr you might see between the unit state and the unit kingdom or between the unit state and europ exist within our own domest polit __PUNCT__
we have the same disagr within our own domest polit __PUNCT__
you do and we do __PUNCT__
and we look at europ __PUNCT__ when we start in iraq for the purpos of remov on of the most horribl tyrant in the world __PUNCT__ saddam hussein __PUNCT__ about which i think we should be proud that we remov thi tyrant and gave the iraqi peopl a chanc for freedom __PUNCT__ there were peopl who disagre with that __PUNCT__
but now we look at franc and germani __PUNCT__ we got fairli pro __PUNCT__ american govern there now __PUNCT__
so thing shift and chang __PUNCT__
you know thei be some disagr __PUNCT__ but the basic fundament relationship between the unit state and europ and the unit state and the unit kingdom __PUNCT__ particularli __PUNCT__ is on of endur friendship __PUNCT__ even if thei somewhat contenti issu sometim __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ mayor giuliani on british presenc in iraq __PUNCT__ i think britain ha to make that decis __PUNCT__
i think that be coordin veri __PUNCT__ veri close with the unit state __PUNCT__
the prime minist told me he just met with ambassador crocker and gener petraeu __PUNCT__
he wa veri impress with them __PUNCT__
had a veri good meet with them __PUNCT__
so i sure whatev britain decid __PUNCT__ it will be coordin with the overal effort there __PUNCT__
i veri __PUNCT__ veri much encourag by gener petraeu and ambassador crocker testimoni __PUNCT__
i think realist progress ha been made __PUNCT__
i sai realist becaus thi is a veri difficult thing that we try to do in iraq __PUNCT__
it is veri __PUNCT__ veri hard to bring about __PUNCT__ as quickli as we try to bring about __PUNCT__ a stabl situat __PUNCT__ a govern of law __PUNCT__ a democraci in a countri that wa beset by oppress and tyranni for so long __PUNCT__
but i think realist __PUNCT__ and we both made as much progress as we can make __PUNCT__
it isn't to sai __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ why we had a special relationship between the unit state and the unit kingdom __PUNCT__
becaus we want to share the bless of liberti with the rest of the world becaus if we can succe in that __PUNCT__ we go to have a peac world __PUNCT__
and to the extent that we don't __PUNCT__ we have these kind of hostil __PUNCT__
