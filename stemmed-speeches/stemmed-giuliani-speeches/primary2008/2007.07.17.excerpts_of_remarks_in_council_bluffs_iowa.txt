mayor giuliani on hi commit to appoint strict constructionist judg __PUNCT__ i believ that on of the most import respons of the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ is the peopl you select to be feder judg __PUNCT__ the judg that you put on the bench __PUNCT__
and the reason for that is unlik a lot of state and local judg __PUNCT__ feder judg ar appoint for life __PUNCT__
so when thei go on the bench __PUNCT__ there no chanc if you made a mistak to fix it __PUNCT__
thei there forev __PUNCT__
and therefor __PUNCT__ the wai in which thei interpret the constitut is enorm import __PUNCT__ and that why in the twelv commit that i made __PUNCT__ the on i go to talk about todai is that we have to appoint strict constructionist judg and reform the legal system __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we need judg who ar go to interpret the constitut and try to figur out what other peopl meant when thei wrote the word __PUNCT__
not what thei would like it to mean __PUNCT__
and that why i would appoint judg like chief justic robert or justic __PUNCT__ alito __PUNCT__ both of whom i work within the justic depart __PUNCT__
or justic scalia who i also work with in the justic depart year befor that __PUNCT__
and justic thoma __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ hese ar the kind of judg i would appoint __PUNCT__ and i realli would know how to do it __PUNCT__
i spent a lot of my life be a lawyer __PUNCT__ be in court __PUNCT__
i spent a lot of my life in the justic depart __PUNCT__
and year ago __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ i wa the third rank offici in the justic depart under presid reagan __PUNCT__
and everi __PUNCT__ thursdai afternoon we went to a meet at the white hous __PUNCT__
we go over to the white hous and sit down at a big tabl in the roosevelt room with all of the peopl in the reagan administr __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and i watch mani of the reagan judg be appoint __PUNCT__
and the fact is that he did a veri __PUNCT__ veri good job __PUNCT__ select realli good judg who interpret the constitut in a wai that will protect your right and my right __PUNCT__
thei will not get it into their head that thei realli legisl and thei can go around chang thing __PUNCT__
thei there to interpret thing __PUNCT__ not to chang thing __PUNCT__
you have legisl to chang thing __PUNCT__
and you can affect that __PUNCT__
you can vote them into offic __PUNCT__
you can vote them out of offic __PUNCT__
you have mayor __PUNCT__ governor and presid to execut the law __PUNCT__
the legislatur make the law __PUNCT__
the execut execut the law __PUNCT__ carri it out __PUNCT__ and the judiciari interpret the law __PUNCT__
it pretti simpl but realli import that we keep it that wai __PUNCT__ and i would be commit to keep it that wai __PUNCT__
mayor giuliani on hi commit to reform the legal system __PUNCT__ the second part of my commit about the legal system is we have to reform it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the legal system is so out of control __PUNCT__
and the democrat aren't go to do anyth about it __PUNCT__
thei not go to do anyth about it at all __PUNCT__
thei go to just make it wors __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if you elect me presid __PUNCT__ i will do someth about it __PUNCT__
we chang the legal system __PUNCT__
we reform it __PUNCT__
we make it like a legal system should be __PUNCT__ where the real kei is to protect the victim and not the lawyer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ so how do you do that __PUNCT__ what we could do is we could sai __PUNCT__ when a lawsuit end __PUNCT__ if you lose the lawsuit __PUNCT__ the judg ha the right to ask you to show why you brought the lawsuit in the first place __PUNCT__
what basi did you have for it __PUNCT__ wa it a sensibl reason where mind could differ or were you just be abus __PUNCT__ and if you just be abus __PUNCT__ then the judg should have to charg that person __PUNCT__ and he should have to pai whatev cost thei incur for hi bring thi abus lawsuit __PUNCT__
if we did that __PUNCT__ we cut down on some of these abus lawsuit __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and then if we also cap damag __PUNCT__
so if peopl get monei __PUNCT__ it should be relat to econom loss __PUNCT__ damag should be cap that wai __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ so should legal fee __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the democrat parti doesn't want to chang it __PUNCT__
thei keep tell you __PUNCT__ thei the parti of the peopl __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i don't know when that wa __PUNCT__ but it been a long time sinc the democrat parti ha been the parti of the peopl __PUNCT__
thei the parti of the trial lawyer __PUNCT__
thei the parti of the person injuri lawyer __PUNCT__
thei mean a lot more than the peopl __PUNCT__
otherwis __PUNCT__ you wouldn't allow a system like thi to continu and to flourish __PUNCT__
i chang the system becaus i realli believ in the right of the peopl __PUNCT__
i realli believ you more import than the trial lawyer __PUNCT__
you more import than the neglig lawyer __PUNCT__
it your right that have to be protect __PUNCT__
thei shouldn't be run thi whole system for their benefit __PUNCT__
i didn't becom a lawyer to watch the legal system becom a system in which lawyer can milk it for million and million of dollar and leav peopl with veri __PUNCT__ veri littl __PUNCT__
it just isn't right __PUNCT__
and if you make me presid __PUNCT__ i chang it __PUNCT__
