fox new __PUNCT__ your world __PUNCT__ mayor giuliani __PUNCT__ i think the feder reserv ha to have the independ to assess these thing __PUNCT__
and gener thei been correct and i have no reason to critic it __PUNCT__
i think thei look at what we all look at __PUNCT__
and monetari polici is import to thi __PUNCT__
i put more of the focu on fiscal polici __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__
i think the govern is go to have to do someth pretti strong here __PUNCT__
i think a veri strong stimulu packag is necessari __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ to me __PUNCT__ a strong stimulu packag is heavi on the perman part __PUNCT__
and that why i put out last week __PUNCT__ we have talk about it __PUNCT__ the largest tax reduct in american histori __PUNCT__
the idea of that wa to sai to the market __PUNCT__ you go to be look at an america that a good invest __PUNCT__
you go to be look at an america that ha growth __PUNCT__
you go to be look at an america that go to allow you a littl bit more rang of profit and a littl bit more rang of see expans __PUNCT__
so i would put heavi emphasi on cut the corpor tax __PUNCT__ cut the capit gain tax __PUNCT__ keep the tax on the dividend low __PUNCT__ the thing that ar veri competit between countri where monei move on place or anoth __PUNCT__
neil cavuto __PUNCT__ but none of these stimulu packag __PUNCT__ includ the presid __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__ have much of a long __PUNCT__ term natur __PUNCT__
a lot of them have these rebat and quick check to folk __PUNCT__
but if that all thei can produc __PUNCT__ and it look like as thi time that is all thei can come up with __PUNCT__ what do you think __PUNCT__ mayor giuliani __PUNCT__ i would think that would not be __PUNCT__ that wouldn't help veri much __PUNCT__
it would be like a band __PUNCT__ aid __PUNCT__
just think of thi situat __PUNCT__
compani that ar consid invest long __PUNCT__ term and have got three or four possibl of where to invest the monei and on of them is america __PUNCT__ thei ar look at an america in which the bush tax cut ar go to expir __PUNCT__ which mean a __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent increas in tax __PUNCT__
thei ar look at an america in which all kind of tax increas program ar be suggest by peopl like charli rangel __PUNCT__
thei look at an american where if a democrat get elect there be a vast expans in the central govern regul of busi and thei look at an america that ha on of the most out of control legal system as far as get su in the world __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ when you look at an america like that __PUNCT__ you mai select ireland or you mai select bermuda or you mai select eastern europ or you mai select china or india __PUNCT__
so the american presid ha to understand that we have to be competit __PUNCT__
