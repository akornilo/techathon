thank you secretari gener __PUNCT__ all the distinguish member that ar here __PUNCT__
it a great honor to come befor you todai and discuss basebal __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ aren't you all here as basebal expert __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ or footbal __PUNCT__ although we defin footbal differ __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ we have a differ definit __PUNCT__
i here to talk about nato __PUNCT__
i have tremend respect for the organ that you all a part of __PUNCT__
the second half of the twentieth centuri __PUNCT__ from the sign of the atlant charter to the fall of the berlin wall __PUNCT__ nato __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ prove to be on of the most success militari allianc in histori __PUNCT__
at a time when oppos forc had the power to destroi civil __PUNCT__ nato came togeth __PUNCT__ function togeth over decad __PUNCT__ and wa abl to bring about freedom to million and million of peopl __PUNCT__
there ar veri few accomplish equal to that in __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ histori __PUNCT__
so thi is an enorm proud tradit that you carri on __PUNCT__
nato help keep the peac and it help to extend the bless of freedom and democraci for mani __PUNCT__ mani peopl __PUNCT__ and it taught us all a lesson that north american and western european __PUNCT__ european __PUNCT__ which ha now expand beyond western europ __PUNCT__ thank good __PUNCT__ we have much more in common than divid us __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we have almost everyth in common and in mani respect it took __PUNCT__ in some case __PUNCT__ bitter enemi and made them into the closest of friend __PUNCT__
there ar veri __PUNCT__ veri few allianc that achiev all that in the period of time that nato ha been abl to achiev it __PUNCT__
but realli in contemporari time we seen equal act of statesmanship __PUNCT__
nato brought new secur to new friend in the baltic republ __PUNCT__ central europ __PUNCT__
these new member have ad their strength and their wisdom to nato __PUNCT__ volunt for mission far from their shore __PUNCT__
thei inspir us to overcom complac and thei give us __PUNCT__ realli a set of principl on which we can expand __PUNCT__
and expand both the mission of nato and the membership of nato becaus nato work remain undon __PUNCT__ and the realiti __PUNCT__ it true of nato __PUNCT__ it true of about just everi institut you can think of __PUNCT__ if you don't chang with the time and you don't expand with the time you not onli don't grow __PUNCT__ you begin to wither __PUNCT__
you begin to becom less import __PUNCT__ less relev and that wouldn't be the right case for nato becaus it accomplish so much __PUNCT__
and it realli import to rememb that nato actual fought it first war in the __NUM__ when nato aircraft help bring an end to the bosnian war __PUNCT__
five year later in the face of the inabl of the unit nation to realli act __PUNCT__ it wa nato that stop genocid in kosovo __PUNCT__
so these ar contemporari accomplish __PUNCT__ immedi accomplish __PUNCT__
then in __NUM__ nato for the first time __PUNCT__ invok articl __NUM__ an attack on on is an attack on all __PUNCT__
and nato troop join in the fight in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and i have to tell you i appreci that as an american __PUNCT__
i appreci that person becaus i wa there for the main attack of that dai which wa on new york citi and i saw the horror that the islam terrorist were abl to perpetr on my citi up close __PUNCT__
and of cours i watch it in washington and over the ski of pennsylvania __PUNCT__
so i have tremend person gratitud for how nato took thi on as an articl __NUM__ mission __PUNCT__
so nato contemporari valu is veri __PUNCT__ veri clear __PUNCT__
the allianc is an effect forc for defend and extend the intern order as an order of peac and respect for human right and respect for law __PUNCT__
nato ha shown that it can act and it will act veri __PUNCT__ veri effect when other intern institut don't seem to be abl to muster the will to be abl to act under these circumst __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ question alwai remain __PUNCT__
the first is should membership __PUNCT__ and question that you kind of resolv __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ should membership have remain frozen at the __NUM__ limit __PUNCT__ nato expand three time dure the cold war __PUNCT__ but it most difficult membership test came after the cold war wa over and nato rose to the challeng of expand __PUNCT__
thei embrac a former adversari when east germani dissolv and unit with west germani __PUNCT__
and germani whole and free took it right place at the heart of the atlant allianc __PUNCT__
sinc then nato ha expand twice more __PUNCT__ to includ former adversari and newli free possess of the old soviet empir includ the new republ __PUNCT__
thei were part of that empir that dissolv and fell apart in mani case due to the firm resolv of nato __PUNCT__
a second question wa whether the allianc ever could or should oper beyond the border of it member state or even beyond the border of europ __PUNCT__
that question wa first answer by the conflict in the balkan and the second event __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ by the respons to __DATE__ and the implic of articl __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so i would sai that nato ha met all the challeng that it been face with __PUNCT__
whether we go back to the cold war period or the new period __PUNCT__ it been abl becaus of the resili of the allianc to adapt itself to meet the challeng that we face in the present world __PUNCT__
and mayb now we face the toughest challeng we ever face befor __PUNCT__
it could be thi terrorist movement __PUNCT__ the islam terrorist movement __PUNCT__
and nato ha to remain relev and import to be abl to combat that movement and give us the opportun to defeat it in the shortest possibl time and in the most effect possibl wai __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ as i said befor __PUNCT__ the law of biologi appli to institut becaus thei made up of human be __PUNCT__
the law of biologi sai to me that you have to adapt if you want to surviv __PUNCT__
you have to grow if you don't want to declin __PUNCT__
it just a natur law that appli to human institut and to human be __PUNCT__
and there ar three thing that i think nato could do to expand effect the meet the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
the first it should becom a global secur allianc __PUNCT__
it should think of itself as a potenti global secur allianc dedic to protect intern peac and order against whatev threat aris __PUNCT__
the primari threat ar threat from territori aggress and threat from terror and threat from piraci __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ in order to do that you have to look beyond europ border __PUNCT__
the new member among well __PUNCT__ govern state with capabl secur forc __PUNCT__ thei can make real contribut to nato __PUNCT__
and third __PUNCT__ all nato member present and futur must make a commit to invest in their militari and build it up becaus thei need it to win the war and secur the peac __PUNCT__
these two thing ar veri inextric combin __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ in our world in the next half centuri or more __PUNCT__
so let start first with the new purpos __PUNCT__
in my view __PUNCT__ nato ha to consid itself someth more than a militari allianc __PUNCT__
we actual ar a lot more than just a militari allianc __PUNCT__
we learn that democraci ar strongest when thei act togeth to protect each other __PUNCT__
and we learn __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ and thi is not meant to be ani kind of unnecessari critic __PUNCT__ it just meant to state realiti __PUNCT__ that there ar area in which the unit nation too often find itself unabl to act and act effect __PUNCT__
so in addit to defeat intern terror movement __PUNCT__ nato should focu on a safer and more secur world by deter territori conquest __PUNCT__ stop prolifer __PUNCT__ whether we talk about nuclear weapon or weapon of mass destruct or chemic weapon or biolog weapon __PUNCT__
by prevent the implos of fail state __PUNCT__ protect the lane of commerc __PUNCT__ protect the sea __PUNCT__ address the bud humanitarian crisi and defend out common valu of freedom __PUNCT__ democraci and the basic human right of men __PUNCT__ women and children __PUNCT__
now some of our friend __PUNCT__ some of our alli __PUNCT__ some of the peopl in thi allianc __PUNCT__ not all but some worri that the unit state will turn awai from nato __PUNCT__ focus our attent on the unit state __PUNCT__ interest outsid of europ __PUNCT__
but all of us have interest outsid of europ __PUNCT__
europ ha interest nowadai veri much ti up to thing outsid of europ __PUNCT__
the secur of the persian gulf matter to america __PUNCT__ matter to europ just as much __PUNCT__
the stabil of east asia matter to american __PUNCT__ it matter to europ just as much as it matter to america __PUNCT__ where we have to uphold nuclear peac and it just a given of the world that we live in __PUNCT__
we live in a global world and an inter __PUNCT__ connect planet __PUNCT__
european ship is just as vulner to piraci __PUNCT__
european citi ar just as vulner to intern terror __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we seen that __PUNCT__
it not just someon exagger predict __PUNCT__
sinc __DATE__ we seen attack on european citi by roughli the same movement that attack new york __PUNCT__ islam terrorist __PUNCT__
and european factori ar subject to energi extort which is someth that we have to jointli combat and deal with __PUNCT__
so european interest extend just as much as american interest do across the globe and our interest ar co __PUNCT__ extens and so no on should have ani fear that as america look at asia __PUNCT__ that an area in which we have to be much more involv in __PUNCT__
look at africa or we look at the middl east __PUNCT__
that somewher where we turn our back on here __PUNCT__
we kind turn our attent to all those area togeth with europ becaus our interest in all those area ar co __PUNCT__ extens with europ and in deal with these problem __PUNCT__ you know assembl coalit of the will on at a time in a reactiv manner is not the worst option __PUNCT__ but quit frankli __PUNCT__ it not the best option either __PUNCT__
it rush __PUNCT__
it cumbersom __PUNCT__
it less effect in a perman allianc __PUNCT__
these member know each other __PUNCT__ have plan to work with each other __PUNCT__ have a long histori of work with each other effect __PUNCT__
that the desir wai to deal with these thing __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ all of us __PUNCT__ and new member __PUNCT__ particularli the older member __PUNCT__ allianc work togeth now these countri have __PUNCT__
thei learn to fight togeth for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
our equip is design to be interoper __PUNCT__
our oper doctrin ar often veri well integr __PUNCT__
our command structur ar cohes __PUNCT__
so why wouldn't we build on thi success __PUNCT__ thi is a better wai to do it than have to assembl coalit of the will which is necessari __PUNCT__ you have to do __PUNCT__
nobodi critic that __PUNCT__
you have to do it __PUNCT__
but thi is a desir wai to do it __PUNCT__
so i think we have to build nato togeth and we mai have some disagr about how exactli how to do it __PUNCT__
that what nato for __PUNCT__ to work out those disagr __PUNCT__
what we should agre on is the notion that we have to build nato __PUNCT__
we have to expand nato __PUNCT__
and our allianc ha alreadi demonstr that it can act veri effect outsid of europ __PUNCT__
in the current environ __PUNCT__ threat can come from anywher and travel from ani distanc to come to your home shore __PUNCT__
from the most remot corner of the world to the heart of our greatest citi __PUNCT__
so thi bring us to our second principl for the futur of nato and that is expand nato membership beyond europ __PUNCT__
it an imper __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ for european secur and for american secur and for the growth of nato to be everyth that it can be and most importantli for the mainten of the intern order __PUNCT__
nato is strong onli becaus it member state ar strong and numer and ad more strong state base on our collect wisdom in area of the world mai be distant from the origin focu of nato can onli make our allianc stronger and more effect __PUNCT__
for those who have some resist to thi __PUNCT__ we should rememb that it wa onli three year after it found that nato ad turkei __PUNCT__ a muslim nation on the doorstep of asia __PUNCT__
that wa a bold step wai back then and it turn out to be a right step and it turn out to be a good on __PUNCT__
it on that strengthen nato __PUNCT__
so let not be afraid of expans __PUNCT__
expans ha help nato and there no reason why todai we can't reach respons into other part of the world __PUNCT__
if anyon want to look at the valu of expand nato __PUNCT__ go ask peopl in warsaw of pragu or ani of the other new state that have join __PUNCT__
it been good for them __PUNCT__
it been good for us __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we know there ar countri that would be interest in join __PUNCT__
we know that there ar countri that should be consid for that __PUNCT__
mani of them cooper with nato alreadi in train mission __PUNCT__ in particular organiz structur whether it australia or south korea or israel or india or japan __PUNCT__ singapor __PUNCT__
we should consid all these countri if thei want to be consid __PUNCT__ and base on our collect wisdom __PUNCT__ there mai be some other that you can think of that should be consid __PUNCT__
there probabl ar a lot of other that should be consid __PUNCT__ but the main thing is rather than ani on particular state __PUNCT__ nato should be open to expand it membership __PUNCT__
and for a practic reason __PUNCT__
we need their help __PUNCT__
we need their help in term of activ militari __PUNCT__ militari that ar vital __PUNCT__ militari that will particip __PUNCT__
obvious each new potenti member will have to appli and it ha to be consid like ani other __PUNCT__ but expans beyond europ should be a focu of nato and nato should be open to it __PUNCT__
it should consid each on of these countri __PUNCT__
some mai want to be consid __PUNCT__
some mai not __PUNCT__
some mai want to continu to have a more inform relationship __PUNCT__
some mai seek to make the relationship more formal and i don't mean by exclus to exclud ani countri you might want to think of __PUNCT__
i just mention these becaus thei been activ discuss at variou time over the last three or four year __PUNCT__
and the nato charter also ha to evolv with time __PUNCT__
the unit state constitut which is a pretti basic document that ha guid the unit state ha been amend __NUM__ time to meet the challeng that we face in the futur __PUNCT__
i believ it import that we make clear that full membership in nato should be restrict to democraci withstand __PUNCT__ and in fact __PUNCT__ sometim __PUNCT__ the abil to get into nato as you move toward democraci __PUNCT__
look what it did for portug __PUNCT__
thi goal __PUNCT__ sometim it can help encourag countri to settl disput __PUNCT__ settl territori disput becaus you can be consid for membership in nato if you got those disput settl __PUNCT__
so we should also think about the tremend potenti nato ha for help to solv some of these long __PUNCT__ term disput becaus if you get them solv then you becom a member __PUNCT__
so thi a veri __PUNCT__ veri valuabl thing __PUNCT__
we see that kind of thing work in turkei in a differ context in turkei seek admiss in the eu __PUNCT__
there valu to thi that goe wai beyond just the allianc itself __PUNCT__
so i believ that the opportun to join nato ha strengthen the new democraci in eastern europ __PUNCT__
i visit some of them in the last coupl of year and i been enorm impress how quickli democraci and rule of law and free market econom have taken hold in these countri __PUNCT__
and nato isn't the onli reason for that __PUNCT__ but i think it on of the reason for that __PUNCT__
we also have to be cogniz of the fact that mani of the democraci in the world have sunk into a peac time level of militari spend that is __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ veri danger __PUNCT__
and my own countri went through that __PUNCT__
gosh we gone through thi coupl of time __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we win war and then we disarm __PUNCT__
it almost seem like a knee jerk reaction __PUNCT__
i talk about america now __PUNCT__
we help win the first world war and america disarm __PUNCT__
we help to win the second world war and america disarm __PUNCT__
and truman had to come along a rebuild our militari veri __PUNCT__ veri quickli to deal with the cold war just like we didn't rebuild our militari until realli the second world war had alreadi start in europ __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ remark we make the same mistak after the cold war __PUNCT__
the cold war __PUNCT__ basic won with the fall of the soviet union and the berlin wall __PUNCT__ what doe america do __PUNCT__ for the third time in a centuri america disarm __PUNCT__
i thought it wa a mistak then __PUNCT__
in retrospect it a much bigger mistak then i even thought it wa __PUNCT__
we cut our militari __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we cut our intellig servic __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and that phenomenon ha also overtaken some of our alli __PUNCT__
thi idea you know we all of sudden have a peac and rosi world and we weren't pai enough attent to the grow islam terrorist threat __PUNCT__
and now that we look back on it __PUNCT__ and i not critic peopl at the time __PUNCT__ but now that we look back on it __PUNCT__ it wa a big mistak becaus thei were give us warn with the attack on the world trade center in __NUM__ and with the attack on khobar tower and kenya and tanzania __PUNCT__
with the attack on uss cole and the declar of war from bin laden __PUNCT__
thei were give us warn and nobodi expect peopl to be prophet __PUNCT__
the point is not to point the finger point anywher __PUNCT__
clearli with the light of histori __PUNCT__ by not repeat the same mistak __PUNCT__
it wa a mistak to disarm dure that period of time __PUNCT__
on task for the next presid of the unit state will be to rebuild the militari __PUNCT__
presid bush ha taken step in that direct and thei veri posit on __PUNCT__ but a lot more ha to be done becaus a lot wa taken out __PUNCT__
so i support creat immedi ten new combat brigad for the armi as a start __PUNCT__
i think the plan increas to the marin corp __PUNCT__ which will take it strength back over __NUM__ should happen __PUNCT__
it should happen realli __PUNCT__ realli quickli __PUNCT__
our navi should be expand __PUNCT__ both to maintain it current role as a guarantor of seaborn commerc and to intercept possibl prolifer __PUNCT__
the fleet should be built back over __NUM__ ship with a combin of platform __PUNCT__ includ the littor combat vessel and virginia class submarin __PUNCT__
and we must make sure our carrier forc is larg enough and flexibl enough to meet __NUM__ centuri demand __PUNCT__
thi is our respons as american __PUNCT__
we have to rebuild our armi __PUNCT__ we have rebuild our marin __PUNCT__ we have to rebuild our navi and we have to rebuild our air forc __PUNCT__
the air forc need __PUNCT__ desper need new refuel tanker __PUNCT__
thei should be provid __PUNCT__
thei need a new long rang bomber to replac the ancient b __PUNCT__ __NUM__ and it time for the hand __PUNCT__ wring over the futur of the f __PUNCT__ __NUM__ to end __PUNCT__
america spent year develop the finest air superior fighter the world ha ever seen and it not __PUNCT__ we shouldn't be abandon it __PUNCT__ even as we move ahead with the f __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ that just a few of the idea __PUNCT__
but the idea here is __PUNCT__ america ha to rebuild it militari __PUNCT__
it ha to rebuild it armi __PUNCT__ it navi __PUNCT__ it air forc __PUNCT__ it marin __PUNCT__ it coast guard __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ america should do it for our own purpos and america should do it as an exampl to all of you __PUNCT__
you should do it too __PUNCT__
we need a stronger militari __PUNCT__
on wai to do it is to bring in new member __PUNCT__
anoth wai to do it is for the present member to invest more in their own defens __PUNCT__
and ultim then in our entir defens __PUNCT__
america ha and should lead the wai but everybodi els should particip in it __PUNCT__
we also need in the american militari a hybrid militari civilian forc __PUNCT__
i call it the stabil and reconstruct corp __PUNCT__
it staf by militari peopl and civilian peopl becaus anoth thing that i think we learn is __PUNCT__ we no longer have to onli win war __PUNCT__ we have to win the peac __PUNCT__
and we learn a lot about how to do that __PUNCT__
we learn a lot about how to do that in bosnia and kosovo __PUNCT__
we learn a lot about how to do that in afghanistan and in iraq __PUNCT__
but on of the thing we should learn in advanc is to have a forc readi to do thi __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i think that corp would undertak task like build road and sewer and school and advis on legal reform and restor the local currenc __PUNCT__
mayb it becaus i wa mayor of america largest citi and i wa mayor of america largest citi dure period of crisi __PUNCT__
you know about __DATE__ __PUNCT__
you probabl don't know the crime crisi we had and the fiscal crunch we had __PUNCT__
i us to think of new york citi as a crisi a week that had to be dealt with __PUNCT__
becaus we so larg and so cosmopolitan and everi problem kind of get amplifi in new york citi __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ to me __PUNCT__ when i look at iraq what i look to is __PUNCT__ how well and how effect ar we keep the civilian order function in the right wai __PUNCT__
becaus ultim that go to be enorm import to whether we accomplish our goal in iraq __PUNCT__
and our goal of victori in iraq is a stabl govern that is abl to take care of __PUNCT__ respons take care of __PUNCT__ the problem of it peopl __PUNCT__
and then act as an alli for all of us in the terrorist __PUNCT__ war against us __PUNCT__
that the goal __PUNCT__
and a hybrid civilian militari forc ha been develop there __PUNCT__ kind of on an ad hoc basi __PUNCT__
we should develop thi on a long term __PUNCT__ a long term basi __PUNCT__
and right now our allianc is struggl to meet it commit and nato and nato nation should take thi respons on and we should rebuild our militari commit to our defens __PUNCT__
nato ha to be seen as strong enough to discourag ani potenti challeng to the intern order __PUNCT__ to the peac and intern order __PUNCT__
so strong even __PUNCT__ that the rise nation __PUNCT__ and we want them to rise peacefulli and the best wai to assur that thei rise peacefulli is thei have such strong militari that thei wouldn't even consid challeng that __PUNCT__ that it would be beyond realli reason comprehens __PUNCT__
if you could spend that percentag of your gdp to match where we ar alreadi in defens of democraci of freedom and human right __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ altern structur like a european defens and secur polici should be seen as enhanc the integr of our allianc rather then divid it or compet badli with for need resourc __PUNCT__
the surest path to irrelev is to downsiz itself and you downsiz when you don't grow __PUNCT__
and then we have to develop a new joint doctrin to deter terrorist us of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
we should us the dormant mechan of the nato nuclear plan council to help us transit to a new doctrin that address the chang threat of terrorist arm with wmd and risk that thei mai attack __PUNCT__
i know we in thi togeth __PUNCT__
i knew it from befor __DATE__ __PUNCT__ it wa kind of reinforc to me on __DATE__ and my wife and i happen to be in london on __DATE__ of __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i wa a half a block awai from where the bomb went off in the liverpool station in london when that first attack took place __PUNCT__
i wa have a meet with a group of lawyer __PUNCT__
usual not the most excit kind of meet you can have with a group of lawyer __PUNCT__ but i am a lawyer __PUNCT__
we were have a meet __PUNCT__ my now campaign chairman and i start with a group of lawyer discuss legal busi __PUNCT__
seem like a pretti benign subject to be discuss and all of the sudden __PUNCT__ john huvan __PUNCT__ who is not in the room with me __PUNCT__ but john huvan is a former new york citi detect who wa with me on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ help guid me and other out of the build we were trap in __PUNCT__ wa with me everi moment on that dai __PUNCT__
all of the sudden he walk in to the meet in london and he lean over and he sai to me __PUNCT__ mayor __PUNCT__ i think a bomb just went off right near us __PUNCT__
and i look at him to make sure he wasn't ly and the express on our face wa __PUNCT__ we aren't go to go though thi again ar we __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ i go to check __PUNCT__
i go to check with the prime minist secur and i go to find out but let no sai anyth until we know __PUNCT__
we don't want peopl to get __PUNCT__ we don't want peopl to get panick __PUNCT__
so i said __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__ john i carri on the meet __PUNCT__ let me know right awai if these peopl have to go and evacu __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__
he come back a few minut later and said __PUNCT__ a bomb just went off half a block awai and i think anoth bomb ha gone off and i don't know how mani ar go to go off todai __PUNCT__ and when you live through on of these attack you __PUNCT__ by the end of the dai you know how mani attack there ar go to be __PUNCT__
while you go through it you don't know and that dai in london remind me of __DATE__ becaus when we had the first attack and then the second attack i check with the white hous when we had got inform that there might be as mani as seven or ten other attack __PUNCT__
it remind me of __PUNCT__ when i live through thi in london through the other three attack that dai __PUNCT__ is we ar all vulner __PUNCT__
we ar all vulner __PUNCT__
we in thi togeth __PUNCT__
from the point of view of the islam terrorist __PUNCT__ new york is a target and washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ is a target __PUNCT__ lo angel __PUNCT__ california __PUNCT__ london __PUNCT__ madrid __PUNCT__ who know where els __PUNCT__ rome __PUNCT__ pari __PUNCT__
i took mani of the then leader of your countri through tour of ground zero right after __DATE__ and more than on of them said to me __PUNCT__ talk about germani or england or franc __PUNCT__ thi could be on of our citi __PUNCT__
thei were right then and thei ar right now and we in thi togeth whether we want to recogn it or not __PUNCT__
thi is someth that been with us for quit some time __PUNCT__ we should get us to it __PUNCT__ we shouldn't frighten our citizen over it __PUNCT__
the more we prepar for thi the calmer our citizen should becom __PUNCT__
the more we ar alert to the threat __PUNCT__ the calmer our societi should becom and it should build our mutual respect __PUNCT__ our mutual understand __PUNCT__ believ me __PUNCT__ nobodi ha all the answer here __PUNCT__
america doesn't have all the answer __PUNCT__ none of your countri have all the answer __PUNCT__ some of our idea mai turn our to be right on __PUNCT__ some mai turn out to be wrong __PUNCT__ some of your mai turn out to be right or wrong but the beauti of thi allianc is that we work togeth and togeth we give ourselv a much better chanc of be correct in the polici judgment we make and be overwhelm and overpow in our abil to deter and defeat our enemi __PUNCT__
and that been nato histori to date __PUNCT__
everi singl challeng it been face with __PUNCT__ it ha met and it ha overcom beyond expect and i am absolut certain it will do the same thing with islam terror __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
