you see __PUNCT__ there ar three audienc out there __PUNCT__ folk __PUNCT__ that we have dealt with __PUNCT__ that i have had to deal with __PUNCT__
there the media class __PUNCT__ there the polit class __PUNCT__ and there we __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__
it is we __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__ that got us to thi point thi far __PUNCT__
it is we __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__ that want chang in washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__
it is we __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__ that ar respons for thi massiv movement that go on across thi countri __PUNCT__
i call it the citizen movement __PUNCT__ the tea parti movement __PUNCT__ the conserv movement __PUNCT__
it is a movement by we __PUNCT__ the peopl __PUNCT__ that ar go to insist on chang in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and plan b is that i will continu to be a voic for the peopl __PUNCT__
that why todai we ar launch __URL__ where the peopl will choos __PUNCT__ not the media __PUNCT__ not the politician __PUNCT__ and the peopl will show that the peopl ar still in charg of thi countri __PUNCT__
through thi new organ __PUNCT__ i will still be promot the biggest chang and transfer of power out of washington d.c __PUNCT__ back to the peopl sinc thi nation began __PUNCT__ and that is the __NUM__ plan __PUNCT__

on of the reason that i ran for presid of the unit state wa such that i could chang washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ from the insid __PUNCT__
plan b is that we ar go to have to chang it from the outsid __PUNCT__
