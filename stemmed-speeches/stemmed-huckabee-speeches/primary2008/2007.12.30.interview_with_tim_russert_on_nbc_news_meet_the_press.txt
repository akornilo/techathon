thi on that came out todai show us down nine __PUNCT__
i don't think anybodi ha a clue __PUNCT__
we find out thursdai night how thei do __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you think some of the commerci that have been on the air talk about your record have hurt __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei mai have __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ peopl in iowa have been bombard __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ bombard __PUNCT__
not onli on commerci __PUNCT__ but in the mail __PUNCT__ at a time when most peopl were kind of look forward to go out to the mailbox and pick up some nice christma card __PUNCT__ instead thei were find out what a bum mike huckabe is __PUNCT__
and i don't know what kind of effect it ha __PUNCT__
peopl of iowa __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ like a posit campaign __PUNCT__
but the relentless attack __PUNCT__ and thei have been relentless __PUNCT__
and when you outspent __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ as i have been here in iowa __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i think it pretti amaz that i where i am __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but ha mitt romnei said anyth that untru about you __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ how long do we have on the program todai __PUNCT__ he said mani thing that ar untru __PUNCT__
he said that i reduc methamphetamin sentenc in arkansa __PUNCT__
truth is i sign a bill in __NUM__ that doubl those sentenc __PUNCT__
we did not reduc them __PUNCT__
our sentenc were four time harsher than thei were in massachusett __PUNCT__
he said that i support special break for illeg alien __PUNCT__
that not true __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
we support simpli give children who had earn a scholarship the same __PUNCT__ it never happen __PUNCT__ it didn't make the legislatur __PUNCT__
he made alleg that our increas spend by ridicul amount __PUNCT__ and the new york time came back and defend that __PUNCT__ and said that just simpli not true __PUNCT__
and thei took him apart and show that the increas in spend were __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ the same if not a littl better than hi if you took into consider the account method we chang in arkansa __PUNCT__ veri modest gain in spend __PUNCT__
he made claim about thing like tax increas __PUNCT__ but he fail to mention that some of those were either court order or thei were vote on by the peopl and approv by the peopl for thing as road __PUNCT__
and i left my road in great shape __PUNCT__ took them from the worst in the countri to what trucker magazin said were the most improv __PUNCT__
he left hi road in a mess in massachusett __PUNCT__ with huge problem in the infrastructur __PUNCT__
he claim that he didn't rais tax __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ he did rais tax by half a billion dollar __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ fee __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ fee __PUNCT__
it a tax __PUNCT__
if you a small busi person and you pai more monei than you paid last year to the govern __PUNCT__ you can call it a fee __PUNCT__ call it a tax __PUNCT__ it a three letter word that mean the same __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you rais tax __PUNCT__ and the cato institut __PUNCT__ a conserv think tank __PUNCT__ gave you a d and an f for your tenureship as governor __PUNCT__
so there have been some legitim critic of you as a republican for rais tax and for spend monei __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i don't think thei legitim critic when you improv educ for the children of your state or when you build highwai that give you econom incent and capac that __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ creat the lowest unemploy number that our state had over had over a sustain period of time __PUNCT__
we saw more new job creat __PUNCT__
that what be a governor is about __PUNCT__
it about creat opportun for the peopl of your state __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ even if it mean rais tax __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ in some case __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i cut __NUM__ tax __PUNCT__
peopl forget what we did do on a posit natur __PUNCT__ elimin the marriag penalti __PUNCT__ index the incom tax for inflat so low __PUNCT__ incom peopl weren't pai high tax rate __PUNCT__
so what we tri to do in tax polici by doubl the child care tax credit and by rais the threshold at which peopl paid __PUNCT__ we untax a lot of the poor peopl and gave them a shot at actual make it up the econom ladder __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when we rais tax __PUNCT__ it wa on of two thing __PUNCT__ either to meet an educ demand __PUNCT__ our school were deem by the court to be unconstitut __PUNCT__
in arkansa __PUNCT__ we been down the road of a governor defi the court and sai __PUNCT__ i not go to follow the court order __PUNCT__
didn't turn out real well __PUNCT__
i wasn't go to be the second arkansa governor to do that __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i proud of the fact that we rais teacher pai __PUNCT__ proud of the fact that __PUNCT__ in everi year we test kid __PUNCT__ we saw vast improv in their test score __PUNCT__ thing were __PUNCT__ got better __PUNCT__ not wors __PUNCT__
and educ wa my ticket out of the __PUNCT__ out of the bottom of the econom spectrum __PUNCT__
educ is a kei for everi child __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that if we go to spend more monei __PUNCT__ and the court said we have to __PUNCT__ then the next thing is __PUNCT__ let make sure we spend it well and we spend it wise __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ let me turn to foreign polici __PUNCT__ specif pakistan __PUNCT__
do you believ that the govern of pakistan should postpon the elect in light of the assassin of benazir bhutto __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ i think that their decis to make __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ __DATE__ come so soon and __PUNCT__ after the assassin __PUNCT__ it mai be problemat for presid musharraf to __PUNCT__ to carri out the elect __PUNCT__
sharif ha said that he go to boycott the elect __PUNCT__ so there is some question how much mean and signific thei will have __PUNCT__
but i don't think it would be appropri for me to try to weigh in on whether or not thei ought to have the elect in their own countri __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ the council on foreign relat publish an articl that you had written __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ mm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and thi is what you advoc for pakistan __PUNCT__ rather than wait for the next strike __PUNCT__ i prefer to cut to the chase by go after al __PUNCT__ qaeda safe haven in pakistan __PUNCT__
the threat of an attack on us is far graver than the risk __PUNCT__ than __PUNCT__ a quick and limit strike against al __PUNCT__ qaeda would bring extremist to power in pakistan __PUNCT__
how soon in your presid would you launch such a strike __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it would depend on how soon we had fix a target __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ tim __PUNCT__ we had soldier in a c __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ parachut strap on their back __PUNCT__ readi to go in and take out osama bin laden __PUNCT__
thei believ that thei had found him __PUNCT__
and the strike wa call back at the last minut __PUNCT__ appar fear that if thei didn't have the permiss of the pakistani govern it would creat huge problem __PUNCT__
i think leav kei al __PUNCT__ qaeda leader is the most import problem we face todai __PUNCT__
take those target out is critic __PUNCT__
on of the thing i want to point out about that articl __PUNCT__ i spoke about pakistan extens back in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and a lot of peopl critic the articl __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ you talk so much about pakistan __PUNCT__ and you didn't speak as much about iran __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl have critic my foreign polici view __PUNCT__ but the fact is __PUNCT__ in light of what happen in the last week __PUNCT__ some of my comment on pakistan seem almost prophet __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but if __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ you went into pakistan in order to take out al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ couldn't you veri well destabil the musharraf regim and help the taliban take over pakistan __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i don't think it would be an effort to destabil the musharraf govern __PUNCT__
i think what we do have to recogn is we spent over __MONEY__ billion in aid __PUNCT__ and the purpos of that aid in pakistan wa to fight terror __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as we kind of look at where that monei spent __PUNCT__ we realiz that not that much of it ha like gone to fight terror in pakistan __PUNCT__
a lot of it ha gone to their militari for reason that didn't have to do with __PUNCT__ with terror __PUNCT__
on of the thing that will happen __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ as a result of the week activ is a greater account for the monei __PUNCT__
it is in our best interest for there to be some stabil __PUNCT__
right now musharraf __PUNCT__ despit some of the concern we have about him __PUNCT__ repres at least some level of secur __PUNCT__ more so than if he were oust immedi __PUNCT__
and i don't think it in the unit state __PUNCT__ best interest to try to get rid of him __PUNCT__
i think kayani now be in charg of the militari is a good thing becaus __PUNCT__ clearli __PUNCT__ he stabl __PUNCT__ he ha a sterl reput both as a militari command and as a person who is not so polit __PUNCT__ but i think will give an even hand to the militari __PUNCT__ which is someth pakistan ha need __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ you know how the man and woman on the street in pakistan would react to a u. __PUNCT__ intervent into their countri __PUNCT__
is it worth destabil gener musharraf in order to captur osama bin laden __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think the question is __PUNCT__ would it destabil him if we simpli went in __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ is it worth the risk __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ if it save american live __PUNCT__ if it potenti take out al __PUNCT__ qaeda number on oper __PUNCT__ that a decis that a presid would have to make __PUNCT__
and if i were sit there as presid __PUNCT__ i would weigh all that inform __PUNCT__
but let me make sure that everybodi understand the number on job for the american presid is to protect thi countri __PUNCT__ to do everi and anyth that it can do to make sure that we don't see skyscrap tumbl to the ground in major citi like we did on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
whatev we must do to protect our sovereignti against those whose ideolog ar so extrem that thei would do someth so cowardli and so dastardli as to take thousand of innoc live in that kind of terrorist action __PUNCT__ ye sir __PUNCT__ you better believ that i do anyth necessari __PUNCT__
i don't want to do it with disregard to what it might do in stabil of a nation __PUNCT__
but sometim you have to look at all the risk and weigh heavili __PUNCT__ but rememb that your most singl critic job is that of protect and preserv the american peopl __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ after the assassin __PUNCT__ you made sever comment about pakistan __PUNCT__ us some inart word __PUNCT__ you got your geographi wrong __PUNCT__
the washington post wrote thi editori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the assassin of benzair bhutto present u. __PUNCT__ presidenti candid with a test __PUNCT__ could thei respond cogent and clearli to a sudden foreign polici crisi __PUNCT__ republican mike huckabe __PUNCT__ flunk abysm __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ hi first statement seem realli uninform __PUNCT__ he appear not to know that mr __PUNCT__ musharraf had end __PUNCT__ martial law __PUNCT__ two week ago __PUNCT__
that wa better than hi next effort __PUNCT__ when he said an appropri u. __PUNCT__ respons would includ __PUNCT__ veri clear monitor of our border to make sure if there ani unusu activ of pakistani come into our countri __PUNCT__
the cynic of thi attempt to connect pakistan crisi with anti __PUNCT__ immigr sentiment wa compound by it astonish senseless __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ some of your word were in __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ what do thei realli think __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ what did thei realli think in the editori __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ pretti specif __PUNCT__
but let me ask you about it __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ peopl your __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ i do want to respond to the specif of that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in thi context __PUNCT__
you were governor of arkansa __PUNCT__ you have no real foreign polici experi __PUNCT__
give us a sens of __PUNCT__ of pakistan __PUNCT__
how would you describ that countri to me __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ it __NUM__ million peopl __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of them ar muslim __PUNCT__
it a countri that doe not have a long histori of democraci __PUNCT__
it been a rel unstabl countri __PUNCT__ altern between militari coup __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ but let me go back to some of these issu __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ primarili shiit or sunni __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ it primarili sunni __PUNCT__ and i think we need to recogn that what we have in __PUNCT__ in the event that have been describ in that editori __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ when thei sai that about the border __PUNCT__ that wa taken complet out of __PUNCT__ out of context __PUNCT__
what i wa speak wa how doe thi event in pakistan affect peopl in iowa __PUNCT__ and my point wa that a lot of peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi is a terribl tragedi to have thi terribl act against an outstand and __PUNCT__ and veri charismat leader __PUNCT__
but it doe affect us __PUNCT__
everyth in the world affect us here in the unit state __PUNCT__
and what i wa try to point out wa that our lack of control of our border __PUNCT__ and i quot the denver post articl that had __NUM__ pakistani arrest __PUNCT__ we don't know how mani came __PUNCT__ that how mani we were __PUNCT__ we were catch __PUNCT__
i said it wa in a on __PUNCT__ year period __PUNCT__ it wa in a four __PUNCT__ year period __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and there were sever more other countri that had much larger number __PUNCT__ accord to our state depart __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ but my point wasn't lost __PUNCT__
my point is that if you don't control your border __PUNCT__ then it not about peopl come across from mexico to pluck chicken and pick lettuc __PUNCT__
we talk about the potenti of a person who can come across thi border with a dirti bomb in hi suitcas __PUNCT__ somebodi who can come across our border who might be bring a shoulder __PUNCT__ fire missil __PUNCT__
and if we don't have better control of our border __PUNCT__ it doe affect the peopl in iowa and the rest of america __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ i want to get to immigr in a second __PUNCT__
but i want to go back to __PUNCT__ stai on foreign polici for a second __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ your articl in foreign affair journal __PUNCT__ you wrote thi __PUNCT__ american foreign polici need to chang it tone and attitud __PUNCT__ open up __PUNCT__ and reach out __PUNCT__
the bush administr arrog bunker mental ha been counterproduct at home and abroad __PUNCT__
give me an exampl of presid bush arrog bunker mental __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ when donald rumsfeld __PUNCT__ despit all the militari advic that said we need __NUM__ boot on the ground to be effect in bring stabil and order __PUNCT__ arbitrarili said we go to have __NUM__ peopl there __PUNCT__
i think secretari gate ha done a much better job in __PUNCT__ in listen to member of congress and listen to __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but that wa the presid __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ __URL__ chief of staff __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ that not the secretari of defens __PUNCT__ that the presid __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ but it __PUNCT__ but i __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you ask me for a specif __PUNCT__ and i give you on __PUNCT__
our administr __PUNCT__ led by secretari rumsfeld __PUNCT__ wa veri specif in prescrib that we were go to have a light footprint __PUNCT__ we were go to put a limit number of troop on the ground __PUNCT__
and despit what the militari expert were give as advic __PUNCT__ and all the depart of defens model that spoke about what it would take to bring stabil __PUNCT__ we ignor those piec of militari advic __PUNCT__
we didn't take the advic from the peopl __PUNCT__ i like to sai __PUNCT__ with blood on their boot and medal on their chest __PUNCT__
we made decis that turn out to be the wrong on __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ that it __PUNCT__ arrog bunker mental __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ i think in time we have also given the world the impress that you either with us __NUM__ percent or you against us __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and you can't quit deal with foreign govern ani more than you can deal with anybodi __PUNCT__ in that sens __PUNCT__ in polit __PUNCT__
polit is about get as much as you can as often as you can __PUNCT__ but recogn that while you mai be against me on an issu todai __PUNCT__ you mai be with me on an issu tomorrow __PUNCT__
try to keep the bridg go __PUNCT__
try to keep road open as much as possibl __PUNCT__
and i do think that there have been time in which we have drawn a proverbi line in the sand and made it veri clear that it all or it noth __PUNCT__
and i think that what i speak of __PUNCT__
and it interest to me that while a few week ago on thi program mitt romnei wa veri critic of me for make that statement __PUNCT__ a few month earlier on meet the __PUNCT__ rather __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ __NUM__ minut __PUNCT__ he himself had talk about the major mistak that had been made by the administr __PUNCT__
he demand of me an apolog __PUNCT__ but he did not demand of himself an apolog for also be critic __PUNCT__ as have most republican __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think republican ar big enough and mayb wise enough that we can be in disagr with certain polici and still be behind our presid and behind thi administr in mani of the thing which thei have done right __PUNCT__
and i been veri complimentari of the presid on the issu where i think he been right __PUNCT__
i stood by him in the war __PUNCT__ i stood by him in the surg __PUNCT__
i wasn't a latecom like mitt romnei wa to believ that the surg wa effect __PUNCT__
and we seen __NUM__ percent declin in civilian death __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent declin in militari casualti sinc the surg began __PUNCT__
it is work __PUNCT__
we ar final begin to see those sign of victori in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you suggest that mitt romnei not run an honor campaign __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ i been veri clear about it __PUNCT__
mitt romnei is run a veri desper and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ a dishonest campaign __PUNCT__
he attack me __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and yesterdai __PUNCT__ or fridai __PUNCT__ i guess it wa __PUNCT__ he launch then just a broadsid attack against senat mccain __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat mccain and i ar rival for the presid __PUNCT__ but i said on mani occas __PUNCT__ i sai it again here todai __PUNCT__ senat mccain is an honor man __PUNCT__ and i believ he an honest man __PUNCT__
i believ he a man of convict __PUNCT__
and i felt like that __PUNCT__ when mitt romnei went after the integr of john mccain __PUNCT__ he step across a line __PUNCT__
john mccain a hero in thi countri __PUNCT__
he a hero to me __PUNCT__
and i just felt like that when mitt romnei get on your show and sai that he had the nra endors when he didn't __PUNCT__ when he come on and sai he pro __PUNCT__ life and yet he sign a bill that give a __MONEY__ co __PUNCT__ pai for an elect abort in hi state health care plan __PUNCT__ when he claim that he realli for the second amend __PUNCT__ but he __PUNCT__ on thi show he talk about how he support limit and restrict on law __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ abid citizen have gun ownership right __PUNCT__ those ar not the mark of a person who pro __PUNCT__ life and pro __PUNCT__ second amend __PUNCT__
and then the thing where he made up these vision that he had of march with martin luther king and hi dad march with him __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ what i said __PUNCT__ and i been pretti blunt about it __PUNCT__ if you aren't be honest in obtain a job __PUNCT__ can we trust you to be honest if you get the job __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ let me ask you about immigr becaus it is your consist on that issu __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ that is go to be talk about __PUNCT__
the debat in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you were activ __PUNCT__ talk about ship __PUNCT__ send illeg immigr home __PUNCT__ and you made thi impass plea __PUNCT__
let watch __PUNCT__

it also veri clear the american peopl ar not go to toler peopl who have gotten here illeg to get in the front of the line __PUNCT__
the onli wai thei can get into the back of the line is to go back to the point of origin __PUNCT__ to get behind that line __PUNCT__ and then modern that line so it shouldn't take eight year to process a piec of paper to get peopl the necessari paperwork to be abl to do that __PUNCT__

huckabe __PUNCT__ to the southern baptist convent __PUNCT__
so it wa a speech made to a christian gather __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and certainli that would be appropri to be said to a gather of southern baptist __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but where doe thi leav non __PUNCT__ christian __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ it leav them right in the middl of america __PUNCT__
i think the judeo __PUNCT__ christian background of thi countri is on that respect peopl not onli of faith __PUNCT__ but it respect peopl who don't have faith __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ the kei issu of real faith is that it never can be forc on someon __PUNCT__
and never would i want to us the govern institut to impos mine or anybodi els faith or to restrict __PUNCT__
i think the first amend __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is explicitli clear __PUNCT__
govern should be restrict __PUNCT__ not faith __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
and govern restrict is on two front __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ it not to prefer on faith over anoth __PUNCT__ and the second __PUNCT__ it not to prohibit the practic of somebodi religion __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so you have no problem appoint atheist to your cabinet __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i wouldn't have ani problem at all appoint atheist __PUNCT__
i probabl had some work for me as governor __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i think you got to realiz if peopl want __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you were a pastor __PUNCT__ but i wa a governor __NUM__ 1/2 year __PUNCT__
i have more execut experi run a govern __PUNCT__
i wa actual in a govern posit longer than i wa a pastor __PUNCT__
and if peopl want to know how i would blend these issu __PUNCT__ the best wai to look at it is how i serv as a governor __PUNCT__
i didn't ever propos a bill that we would remov the capitol dome of arkansa and replac it with a steepl __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we didn't do tent reviv on the ground of the capitol __PUNCT__
but my faith is import to me __PUNCT__
i try to be more descript of it __PUNCT__
i just don't want to run from it and act like it not import __PUNCT__
it drive my view on everyth from the environ to poverti to diseas to hunger __PUNCT__
issu __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ i think the republican need to take a greater leadership role in __PUNCT__
and as a republican __PUNCT__ but as a christian __PUNCT__ i would want to make sure that we speak out on some of these issu that i think we been lack in as a parti and as __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ peggi noonan __PUNCT__ a woman of faith who write for the wall street journal __PUNCT__ said that sometim it appear your philosophi is __PUNCT__ thi is what god want __PUNCT__ and that doesn't encourag discuss __PUNCT__ it squelch it __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and thi is what you wrote in your book __PUNCT__ kid who kill __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it is now difficult to keep track of the vast arrai of publicli endors and institution support aberr __PUNCT__ from homosexu and pedophilia to sadomasoch and necrophilia __PUNCT__
why would you link homosexu with sadomasoch __PUNCT__ pedophilia and necrophilia __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what i wa point out is all of these ar deviat from what ha been the tradit concept of sexual behavior and men and women have children __PUNCT__ rais those children in the context of a __PUNCT__ of a tradit marriag and famili __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ taken out of the larger context of that book __PUNCT__ speak about how so mani of our social institut have been broken down __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but do you think homosexu is equival to pedophilia __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __URL__ sadomasoch __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ of cours not __PUNCT__
i didn't sai __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but thi is what concern peopl __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ thi is what you did sai about homosexu __PUNCT__ i feel homosexu is an aberr __PUNCT__ unnatur and sin lifestyl __PUNCT__
that million of american __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ understand __PUNCT__ when a christian speak of sin __PUNCT__ a christian sai all of us ar sinner __PUNCT__
i a sinner __PUNCT__ everybodi a sinner __PUNCT__
what on sin is __PUNCT__ mean it miss the mark __PUNCT__
it miss the bull ey __PUNCT__ the perfect point __PUNCT__
i miss it everi dai __PUNCT__ we all do __PUNCT__
the perfect of god is seen in a marriag in which on man __PUNCT__ on woman live togeth as a coupl commit to each other as life partner __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ even marri coupl don't do that perfectli __PUNCT__ so sin is not some act of equat peopl with be murder or rapist __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but when you sai aberr or unnatur __PUNCT__ do you believ you born gai or you choos to be gai __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ i don't know whether peopl ar born that wai __PUNCT__
peopl who ar gai sai that thei born that wai __PUNCT__
but on thing i know __PUNCT__ that the behavior on practic is a choic __PUNCT__
we mai have certain tendenc __PUNCT__ but how we behav and how we carri out our behavior __PUNCT__ but the import issu that i want to address __PUNCT__ becaus i think when you bring up the faith question __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i been ask more about my faith than ani person run for presid __PUNCT__
i ok with that __PUNCT__
i hope i answer these question veri candidli and veri honestli __PUNCT__
i think it import for us to talk about it __PUNCT__
but the most import thing is to find out __PUNCT__ doe our faith influenc our public polici and how __PUNCT__ i never tri to rewrit scienc textbook __PUNCT__
i never tri to come out with some wai of impos a doctrinair christian perspect in a wai that is realli against the constitut __PUNCT__
i never done that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you said you would ban all abort __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that not just becaus i a christian __PUNCT__ that becaus i an american __PUNCT__
our found father said that we all creat equal __PUNCT__
i think everi person ha intrins worth and valu __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but mani american believ that that would be __PUNCT__ that would be you impos your faith belief __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
it not a faith belief __PUNCT__
it deeper than that __PUNCT__
it a human belief __PUNCT__
it goe to the heart of who we ar as a civil __PUNCT__
if i believ that your intrins worth is not chang by your ancestri __PUNCT__ your last name __PUNCT__ by your iq __PUNCT__ by your abil or disabl __PUNCT__ if i valu your life and respect it with digniti and worth becaus it is human __PUNCT__ then that what draw me to the inescap conclus that i should be for the sanctiti of everi and each human life __PUNCT__
that why we go after that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old boi in the wood of north carolina when he lost __PUNCT__ not becaus he ha greater worth than someon els __PUNCT__ but becaus we believ he ha equal worth as everyon els __PUNCT__
i like it that in thi countri we treat each other __PUNCT__ at least we should __PUNCT__ with that sens of equal __PUNCT__
our found father pen that in the declar of independ when thei declar __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ some american believ that life doe not begin at concept __PUNCT__ and that it __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ scientif i think that almost __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ a point that you couldn't argu __PUNCT__
how __PUNCT__ how could you sai that life doesn't begin at concept __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
do you respect that view __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ __URL__ russert __PUNCT__ do you respect that view __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ i respect it as a view __PUNCT__ but i don't think it ha biolog credibl __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and what would happen to doctor or women who particip in abort __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ it alwai the __PUNCT__ the point of try to sai __PUNCT__ ar you go to crimin it __PUNCT__ that not the issu __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if it __PUNCT__ if it illeg __PUNCT__ it would be __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ it would be __PUNCT__
and i think you don't punish the woman __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ becaus it not about __PUNCT__ i consid her a victim __PUNCT__ not a __PUNCT__ not a crimin __PUNCT__
you would __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you would punish the doctor __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ i think if a doctor knowingli took the life of an unborn child for monei __PUNCT__ and that why he wa do it __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ i think you would __PUNCT__ you would find some wai to sanction that doctor __PUNCT__
i don't know that you put him in prison __PUNCT__ but there someth to me untoward about a person who ha commit himself to heal peopl and to make peopl aliv who would take monei to take an innoc life and to make that life dead __PUNCT__
there someth that just doesn't ring true about the purpos of medic practic when the first rule of the hippocrat oath is __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ do no harm __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ if you take the life and suction out the piec of an unborn child for no reason than it inconveni to the mother __PUNCT__ i don't think you live up to your hippocrat oath of do no harm __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ __DATE__ you told me you go to win iowa caucus __PUNCT__
ar you __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ oh i hope so __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i realli do __PUNCT__
