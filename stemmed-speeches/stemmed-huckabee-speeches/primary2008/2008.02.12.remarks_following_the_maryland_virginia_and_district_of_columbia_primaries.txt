__PUNCT__ join in progress __PUNCT__ so the next sever week ar go to be the veri intens week when a lot of deleg ar at stake __PUNCT__
and a lot will be decid __PUNCT__ as far as the long __PUNCT__ term impact of where thi process is go __PUNCT__
but on thing that we have continu said __PUNCT__ and i go to reiter tonight __PUNCT__ that the nomin is not secur until somebodi ha __NUM__ deleg __PUNCT__
that ha not yet happen __PUNCT__
and we still continu to work and to give voter in these state a choic __PUNCT__
i think if anyth that we do is import __PUNCT__ it recogn that the peopl in the state who have not had their elect have as much right to an elect as all of these folk who ar frontload for either super tuesdai or prior to that __PUNCT__
and if there ar these call to sai __PUNCT__ let just call it off __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that a disservic to the peopl in texa __PUNCT__ and ohio __PUNCT__ and pennsylvania __PUNCT__ and north carolina __PUNCT__ and nebraska __PUNCT__ and other state and territori who have yet to have that opportun to vote __PUNCT__
so we march on __PUNCT__
everi time we win __PUNCT__ we ecstat __PUNCT__
when we don't win __PUNCT__ we disappoint __PUNCT__ but we not knock out __PUNCT__ and we continu to believ that everi dai provid a new opportun for us to keep the messag go __PUNCT__ show the contrast __PUNCT__ and hopefulli give peopl in the republican parti a caus to be for and also to keep it __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ in a respect and i think the kind of tone and tenor that ha __PUNCT__ i would like to think __PUNCT__ brought some honor to the process __PUNCT__
so let me take a few of your question __PUNCT__ and we go from there __PUNCT__
question __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ tonight senat mccain camp __PUNCT__ jill hazelbak __PUNCT__ said that it is mathemat imposs for governor huckabe to secur the nomin __PUNCT__
you said the other dai that you major in miracl __PUNCT__ not math __PUNCT__
ha anyon on your campaign staff done ani of their own deleg math __PUNCT__ would you be abl to comment on that __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we understand __PUNCT__ in term of the convent process __PUNCT__ bar __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ some someth that could happen along the wai in the campaign for senat mccain __PUNCT__ or if he doesn't acquir enough deleg __PUNCT__ that realli the possibl __PUNCT__ that it could go to the convent __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i hear all the thing that ar said __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it still __PUNCT__ i go back to thi fact __PUNCT__
and i just can't sai it loudli or mayb emphat enough __PUNCT__
you got to have __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and while it mai be mathemat imposs to see how it could plai out right now __PUNCT__ i know thi __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ nobodi ha the __NUM__ deleg __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ therefor __PUNCT__ it would be a littl prematur to quit until the game ha actual come to a conclus __PUNCT__
and i also remind everybodi that it wa the republican nation committe who creat the rule and the process and said __PUNCT__ here what it take to be the nomine __PUNCT__
nobodi made it to that point yet __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i not been on who believ that you leav the field becaus it gotten difficult __PUNCT__
you stai __PUNCT__ and you keep plai until the last second of the clock ha sound __PUNCT__
