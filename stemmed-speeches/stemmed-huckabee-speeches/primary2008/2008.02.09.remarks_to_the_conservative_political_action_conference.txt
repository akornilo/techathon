__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ becaus of what thei and other like them in their gener instil in me __PUNCT__ i grew up believ that no matter where you start in thi countri __PUNCT__ it wasn't where you had to stop __PUNCT__
and that wa the great of america is that we had individu freedom __PUNCT__ that our freedom wa not ti to the group to which we were automat or arbitrarili connect __PUNCT__
our freedom wa ti to our own individu soul __PUNCT__
it wa a gift from god __PUNCT__ not our govern __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ it wa instil in me that becaus freedom is individu __PUNCT__ person respons is also individu and wa upon me and that i could not expect somebodi or the govern to do for me what i wa suppos to do for myself __PUNCT__

i believ that some thing were right and some thing were wrong __PUNCT__ and when we went with the right __PUNCT__ we had strength __PUNCT__
and when we saw that there wa no moral center and there wa noth that realli ever could be defin a moral absolut __PUNCT__ then we were lost and confus __PUNCT__
i also wa hand a book by haskel jone when i wa a teenag __PUNCT__

i realiz that it is not polit correct to sai what i about to sai __PUNCT__ but i believ it sinc i wa a teenag __PUNCT__ and i will not recant it now __PUNCT__
the reason that america is a great nation is becaus america is a special nation __PUNCT__
and the reason america is a special nation is becaus it wa found by peopl who were first on their knee befor thei were on their feet __PUNCT__
we ar a nation root in our faith __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ i had the incred privileg and joi to have visit almost __NUM__ countri across the world __PUNCT__

but in all of my travel and all of the wai in which i touch other part of the world __PUNCT__ i yet to find ani countri __PUNCT__ as enchant as i wa with it __PUNCT__ for which i would even consid for a moment give up my citizenship in the unit state of america to trade it for resid anywher els on earth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we ar a special nation __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and we ar a special nation becaus __PUNCT__ throughout our histori __PUNCT__ we have been peopl who have made choic rather than simpli echo the voic of other __PUNCT__
i know that there wa some specul that i might come here todai to announc that i would be get out of the race __PUNCT__
but i want to make sure you understand __PUNCT__
am i quit __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let get that settl right now __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i not __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ and the reason is simpl __PUNCT__ becaus i go back to that which help crystal in me a conserv viewpoint as a teenag when it wasn't easi or popular to be a republican or a conserv in my hometown __PUNCT__ becaus i do believ that america is about make choic __PUNCT__ not simpli echo that of other __PUNCT__
let other join the __PUNCT__ me __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ crowd __PUNCT__
but i didn't get where i am todai and i didn't fight the battl in a state that __PUNCT__ when i becam it governor __PUNCT__ wa __NUM__ percent democrat __PUNCT__ by simpli echo the voic of other __PUNCT__
i did it by stake out a choic __PUNCT__ state that choic __PUNCT__ make that choic and fight for that choic __PUNCT__ to believ that some thing were right __PUNCT__ some thing were wrong __PUNCT__ and it better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ when i wa a teenag __PUNCT__ there wa a phrase that came late in the __PUNCT__ 60 and earli __PUNCT__ 70 that sort of wa a mantra for mani of us as conserv __PUNCT__
and quit frankli __PUNCT__ i rememb it on bumper strip __PUNCT__
it said __PUNCT__ my countri __PUNCT__ right or wrong __PUNCT__
and i guess mani of us subscrib to that view that it is my countri __PUNCT__ right or wrong __PUNCT__
but the real histori of that statement goe back to the 1800 __PUNCT__ when a senat from missouri name carl schurz __PUNCT__ who serv from __NUM__ to __NUM__ a german immigr who came to thi countri __PUNCT__ later elect to the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ onc serv in a presid cabinet after that __PUNCT__ di in the earli 1900 __PUNCT__
but the point of context of the statement is thi __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ my countri __PUNCT__ right or wrong __PUNCT__
when it right __PUNCT__ we will keep it right __PUNCT__
and when it wrong __PUNCT__ we will make it right __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__
and ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ that ought to be the heart cry of everi conserv __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ when it is right __PUNCT__ we will keep it right __PUNCT__
but when it is wrong __PUNCT__ we will make it right __PUNCT__
i want to sai again that freedom doe not exist in a vacuum __PUNCT__
it ha to have moral clariti __PUNCT__
we have to believ that murder __PUNCT__ ly __PUNCT__ steal ar wrong or freedom doesn't work __PUNCT__
freedom ha to alwai oper in the context in which respons is the other wing of the airplan on our individu freedom and choic __PUNCT__
if we __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__ ever fail to understand that __PUNCT__ then we will disintegr and becom like mani of the cultur that we todai have to confront and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ fight __PUNCT__ who do not believ that it is wrong to murder __PUNCT__ even to murder on own child for the sake of the polit caus of islamo __PUNCT__ fascism __PUNCT__
what separ us from that veri cultur out to destroi us is that it never would be conceiv to us that we would strap a bomb to the belli of our own children and march our own child into a room full of innoc peopl to deton the bomb in order to make a polit point __PUNCT__ becaus we believ some thing ar right and some thing ar wrong __PUNCT__
and we would believ it wrong to kill our own children for a purpos beneath that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ but we also believ that there ar some thing that ar right __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ as conserv __PUNCT__ we believ that it is right to protect the sovereignti of the unit state and to make sure that we never __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__ for ani circumst __PUNCT__ under ani purpos __PUNCT__ ever yield on ounc of our sovereignti over to some intern tribun __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ that why we have to fight __PUNCT__ continu applaus __PUNCT__ that why we need to fight against the law of the sea treati and make sure that it get a good burial at sea __PUNCT__
that why we should sai no to kyoto __PUNCT__ becaus it not give over __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ our sovereignti __PUNCT__
and it why ani time some unit state judg who ha taken an oath to the constitut of the unit state should invok some intern law as a basi upon which to make a decis __PUNCT__ he should be summarili impeach for have done so __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ it is right to have a strong militari __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ on of the mistak that we have made is we have allow ourselv to believ that the peac dividend of the clinton administr is someth that is anyth less than ha becom now the war deficit __PUNCT__ becaus we have fail to keep our militari spend up to the level at which we can have the troop strength that we desper need __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ in the next elect cycl __PUNCT__ and hopefulli in the next administr __PUNCT__ we will return to the kind of at least gdp spend that we had dure the reagan year __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ quit frankli __PUNCT__ the quickest path and the surest path to peac is to make sure that we have the kind of militari that no on on earth want to engag in a battl __PUNCT__ know full well thei don't stand a chanc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ it is right for us to be on the offens against islamo __PUNCT__ fascism and not wait until thei attack us __PUNCT__
and on thi __PUNCT__ we need to salut the presid for the fact that he ha not been will to wait until thei attack us again on our soil __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ unlik ani war we have ever fought in thi nation __PUNCT__ thi is not a war for soil __PUNCT__
thi is a war for our soul __PUNCT__
we will either win it or we will lose it __PUNCT__
and thi nation must ralli to the point where we recogn there is no compromis __PUNCT__
there is no altern __PUNCT__
we must win __PUNCT__
thei must lose __PUNCT__
islamo __PUNCT__ fascism must disappear from the face of the earth or we will __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ it is right for us to believ in a govern that give to us lower tax and less govern and control spend __PUNCT__
and i know that you believ that that is the what __PUNCT__
but let me share with you the why __PUNCT__ becaus i think sometim in the polit debat of todai we miss the point __PUNCT__
thi goe not to the heart just of a polit argument but to a moral on __PUNCT__
when govern take more from us and confisc more of our earn than it ha a right to confisc for the basic purpos of govern __PUNCT__ which is not to provid for us but mere to protect us so that we mai provid for ourselv __PUNCT__ then it ha rob us of our capac to rais our own famili and to engag in what give us strength econom __PUNCT__ and that is a free __PUNCT__ market system __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ the reason that our tax system is irrepar broken is becaus in thi citi it is not realli run anymor by __NUM__ member of congress but the __NUM__ lobbyist __PUNCT__ __NUM__ to on to the member of congress __PUNCT__ who manipul the tax code and creat winner and loser __PUNCT__
the reason that i am a strong support of the fair tax is that it end __NUM__ page of gobbledi __PUNCT__ gook in the name of the ir tax code __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ and it end __PUNCT__ onc and for all __PUNCT__ the complet nonsens concept that we ar to penal product while subsid irrespons __PUNCT__
that is counterintuit to a strengthen economi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i talk to a man in manchest __PUNCT__ new hampshir who wa a machinist at the machin shop i wa tour __PUNCT__
he told me of hi daughter who wa go to cornel grad school at the cost of __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ which my first thought wa __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ god __PUNCT__ my daughter doesn't want to go to cornel grad school __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__
but then he told me __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i work a second shift so i can help my daughter __PUNCT__
but the problem is __PUNCT__ work the second shift ha put me in a whole new tax bracket __PUNCT__
most of what i make in the second shift __PUNCT__ the govern take awai from me in higher tax __PUNCT__
i hate to tell him __PUNCT__ but the truth is if he get in that higher tax break __PUNCT__ there other issu as well __PUNCT__
if he save the monei __PUNCT__ we tax it __PUNCT__
if he invest it __PUNCT__ we tax the dividend from the stock market __PUNCT__
if he bui and sell __PUNCT__ we tax the capit gain __PUNCT__
and if the poor gui keel over dead from work too hard __PUNCT__ we tax him at hi death __PUNCT__
no wonder peopl ar frustrat __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there on wai he can get some feder help for hi daughter __PUNCT__
he can quit work altogeth __PUNCT__ sit home and watch espn all dai __PUNCT__ and then she qualifi for assist __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ can anybodi tell me that make sens __PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ i got a better idea __PUNCT__
i got a better idea than the nonsens __PUNCT__ a better idea than the nonsens of that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ page tax code that cost american busi __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ billion __PUNCT__ to __MONEY__ billion a year in complianc cost __PUNCT__ that choke the life out of small busi __PUNCT__
it a shame that the republican parti us to be the champion of a small busi owner __PUNCT__
and we need to be again __PUNCT__ becaus the fact is __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of our job come from there __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of our new job __PUNCT__ and even big busi start out as small busi __PUNCT__
most big busi depend on the suppli from small busi __PUNCT__
and todai the reason mani small busi owner find it hard to surviv and compet is becaus the competit that thei face the fiercest is not from their competitor __PUNCT__
it from their own govern __PUNCT__ with excess taxat __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__ and the threat of litig __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we can chang that __PUNCT__
i like to be the presid that put the ir out of busi __PUNCT__ nail the __PUNCT__ go out of busi __PUNCT__ sign on their front door __PUNCT__ and take these tax form like thi and sai to everi american __PUNCT__ goodby __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ chant of __PUNCT__ we like mike __PUNCT__ we should demand transpar and account from our govern __PUNCT__
i would propos that everi time the feder govern make ani expenditur __PUNCT__ it post it on the internet within __NUM__ hour so you could find out exactli where everi dollar of the feder budget goe __PUNCT__ down to what it cost to mow the courthous lawn in your hometown __PUNCT__
wouldn't that shock some peopl to find out exactli how our tax monei come in and how it goe out __PUNCT__ i believ that it right to demand that govern should facilit and not complic the free __PUNCT__ market system __PUNCT__
i think it right to believ that mother and father rais better kid than govern do __PUNCT__ and we don't need govern tell us how to rais our kid and grow our famili __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ and i believ it right for us to understand someth that come from the veri heart of our found __PUNCT__ and that is that life is sacr and should be celebr and elev __PUNCT__
and ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ i know that there ar some __PUNCT__ even in the conserv movement __PUNCT__ who think that the issu such as the sanctiti of life don't belong in the discuss __PUNCT__ but let me tell you why thei do and why __PUNCT__ under no circumst __PUNCT__ will i ever be abl to do anyth less than not just support but to be will to lead a human life amend to the unit state constitut __PUNCT__
and hear me out as to why __PUNCT__
from the begin of thi countri __PUNCT__ our found father said it in eloqu word when __NUM__ men put their signatur on a document and thei said __PUNCT__ we hold these truth to be self __PUNCT__ evid __PUNCT__ that all men ar creat equal and ar endow by their creator with certain inalien right __PUNCT__ among these __PUNCT__ life __PUNCT__ liberti and the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__
at the heart of that statement is thi radic idea for __NUM__ that flew in the face of everyth that had been a part of their cultur __PUNCT__ in which ancestri __PUNCT__ last name and net worth were what made a person have worth or not __PUNCT__
thei said we all equal __PUNCT__
todai i stand here becaus of their willing to put their blood on the line to give a kid like me the opportun to be as equal as the aristocrat __PUNCT__
none of us would probabl be sit here talk about our freedom had it not been for their courag in recogn the equal of all of us __PUNCT__
but at the heart of understand that is that if we ar inde equal __PUNCT__ then it mean that all of us have intrins valu and worth __PUNCT__ and no on ha more than anoth __PUNCT__
and noth extern give us greater or less worth __PUNCT__ not our abil or disabl __PUNCT__ not our net worth __PUNCT__ not our job posit __PUNCT__ not our last name or ancestri __PUNCT__ not our race __PUNCT__ not our gender __PUNCT__
not on thing make us more or less equal __PUNCT__
i believ that the sanctiti of a human life is root in who we ar as a cultur and a civil __PUNCT__
and should we turn our back on thi fundament truth __PUNCT__ we have turn our back on the veri essenc and foundat of who we ar as a peopl that ha alwai given us that understand that we leav no man on the battlefield __PUNCT__
and even when a boi scout is lost in the wood of north carolina __PUNCT__ we go look for him __PUNCT__ becaus we believ hi life ha valu and mean __PUNCT__ and we care as if it were our own __PUNCT__
that what make us a great __PUNCT__ wonder __PUNCT__ god __PUNCT__ bless nation __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ let me also sai that it is right for our countri __PUNCT__ in believ in our sovereignti __PUNCT__ to demand that we have someth that everi nation on earth accept and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ assum would be a part of it nation essenti __PUNCT__ a secur border __PUNCT__
how we can ever believ that we can be a sovereign nation or a free nation without secur our border is beyond me __PUNCT__
and ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ our nation govern ha miser fail to do someth that most of us all across thi countri realiz __PUNCT__
thi is a great nation that welcom peopl __PUNCT__
we not hostil __PUNCT__
we alwai been a nation of immigr __PUNCT__
most of us come from ancestor who immigr here from somewher __PUNCT__
but we also a nation of law __PUNCT__ and we believ that if you knock on our front door and you hungri __PUNCT__ chanc ar we ask you to sign the guest book and we try to feed you and help you __PUNCT__
but if you break through the window in the middl of the night __PUNCT__ god help you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ the sad thing is when our own govern put the ladder up against the window __PUNCT__
it a littl hard to blame the person climb up the ladder as much as it is the govern who put the ladder and sai __PUNCT__ go ahead and climb __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ let fix what wrong __PUNCT__
i had a boyhood pastor who us to tell me __PUNCT__ if you don't stand for someth __PUNCT__ you fall for anyth __PUNCT__
and i believ that that perhap true now more than ever __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i want to just conclud todai by share with you that sometim __PUNCT__ in the cours of elect __PUNCT__ a lot of thing get said __PUNCT__

thei weren't there when my door wa nail shut upon my elect as lieuten govern in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ nail shut by the democrat in the state capitol __PUNCT__ who kept it nail shut for the first __NUM__ dai that i wa in offic __PUNCT__
and i get on an elev __PUNCT__ thei get off __PUNCT__
i walk down the hall __PUNCT__ thei turn the other wai __PUNCT__ or the time when i go into cafe and restaur to campaign and peopl refus to shake my hand becaus i had the audac to be a republican in a state where that just wasn't accept __PUNCT__
believ me __PUNCT__ i understand what it is to go into a state capitol where there never been a gener broad __PUNCT__ base tax cut in __NUM__ year and propos on __PUNCT__ and three month later sign it into law __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ time after that sign tax cut into law in a state that didn't know how to handl that befor __PUNCT__
that a conserv __PUNCT__ folk __PUNCT__ against the head wind that weren't easi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ to reform welfar in a state that believ that it wa an entitl __PUNCT__ and to take half the peopl off and get them into job __PUNCT__ not just take them off welfar but to get them emploi __PUNCT__ and to see the lowest unemploy number in our state and the highest employ number and the largest number of new job and a __NUM__ percent increas in per capita incom and the cut capit gain tax and the elimin of the marriag penalti and the doubl of the child care tax credit and the index of the incom tax for inflat and the freez of properti tax for elderli peopl so thei did not lose their home becaus govern made them end up have to move awai __PUNCT__
i understand someth about the necess of that __PUNCT__
i rememb when legisl were on the capitol step have new confer everi dai call for __PUNCT__ demand that we have a special session to rais tax __PUNCT__
and i final creat the tax me more fund __PUNCT__

i spent __NUM__ and a half year __PUNCT__ term as governor fight the corrupt of a on __PUNCT__ parti polit machin that i happen to know a littl bit about __PUNCT__ becaus i the onli person who ever run against the clinton polit machin and beat it four time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__
