governor __PUNCT__ good morn __PUNCT__
let go right to the economi becaus there is __PUNCT__ with no question about it __PUNCT__ a recess out there in michigan where thi next primari is go to be held __PUNCT__
john mccain sai some of the job have been in __PUNCT__ lost in michigan ar simpli not come back __PUNCT__
governor romnei sai he go to try to get them back __PUNCT__
where do you come down on thi __PUNCT__ isn't mccain realli right about that __PUNCT__ some of these manufactur job that have gone oversea __PUNCT__ it go to be imposs to bring them back __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ when we talk about manufactur __PUNCT__ you need to understand why manufactur is import to america __PUNCT__
it not just about the job __PUNCT__ though that critic __PUNCT__ and we want to be abl to be __PUNCT__ have the capac to manufactur becaus those ar the job that provid stabil for the middl class __PUNCT__
it alwai been a critic part __PUNCT__
but there anoth reason manufactur is critic for the unit state __PUNCT__
if we can't realli produc our own weapon of self defens and we outsourc our manufactur __PUNCT__ we outsourc our freedom __PUNCT__
and on of the thing that i said __PUNCT__ there three thing we have to have for freedom __PUNCT__ feed ourselv __PUNCT__ fuel ourselv and fight for ourselv __PUNCT__
the arsen to democraci wa what franklin roosevelt call america __PUNCT__ and the heartland of that arsen ha been michigan __PUNCT__ where thei realli help us to understand how to produc our airplan __PUNCT__ our tank __PUNCT__ our bullet __PUNCT__ our bomb and to build thing that provid for us the capac to be free __PUNCT__
if we lose that __PUNCT__ we lose more than just job __PUNCT__
we lose our veri basi of freedom __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ i think everybodi would agre with that __PUNCT__ but what ar you plan to do to get michigan back on it feet __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ on thing we done __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__ we had free trade agreement that we haven't enforc on both side of the border __PUNCT__
i a free trade gui __PUNCT__ but i a fair trade gui and that not what happen __PUNCT__
when you have on side that cheat by send in product that ar contamin with lead paint or that make our pet sick __PUNCT__ when you have product method that pollut the environ and mistreat and violat the human right of worker __PUNCT__ that not a realli free trade agreement that be enforc __PUNCT__
so a lot of american ar find that their govern is not try to help them keep their job __PUNCT__ their govern is work against them __PUNCT__
the unit state govern ought to work to make sure that __PUNCT__ if we go to have free trade agreement __PUNCT__ that these ar be enforc both side __PUNCT__
otherwis __PUNCT__ it as if the unit state govern is work for the job to go to someplac els __PUNCT__
and when you look into the face of a michigan worker __PUNCT__ you look into the face of anxieti __PUNCT__ of a person who not sure that he go to be abl to get a paycheck __PUNCT__ put food on hi tabl and send hi kid to colleg __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ do you have ani plan for ani kind of a cut tax to get the economi just __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ on a __PUNCT__ on a nation __PUNCT__ on the nation level __PUNCT__ do you have ani kind of a plan to bring the countri out of a recess __PUNCT__ mayb it not in a recess nationwid __PUNCT__ but a lot of peopl think it veri close to that __PUNCT__
what do you plan to do about that __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ our tax system is part of the problem __PUNCT__ bob __PUNCT__
it penal product __PUNCT__
if you creat a graduat tax system that graduat the tax rate on the level of product and the level of earn __PUNCT__ it counterintuit to the economi __PUNCT__
the reason that i support the fair tax is that it doesn't penal product __PUNCT__ it simpli tax peopl at the point of consumpt __PUNCT__
there __MONEY__ trillion of us capit that been move offshor __PUNCT__ mark off in cayman island bank account __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ mai i just interrupt you __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ but i just want to make the point that that monei is not __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ __URL__ the unit state economi __PUNCT__ and it could be __PUNCT__
schieffer __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__

secondli __PUNCT__ i make sure that we target particularli high unemploy state like michigan with job retrain program __PUNCT__ and we us the commerc depart and we us everi resourc that we had to try to make sure that we bring busi and industri with incent to some of these hard __PUNCT__ hit area so that we can keep the job __PUNCT__
the final thing i do is i insist that we enforc both side of the trade agreement that we have __PUNCT__ and that we take a much harder look at the wai that thei be carri out on the other side __PUNCT__
the american worker go to hi job todai need to know that hi govern is work for him __PUNCT__ not against him __PUNCT__

but he also believ that lower tax ar better than higher tax __PUNCT__ and i believ that __PUNCT__
and i believ less govern is better than more govern __PUNCT__
