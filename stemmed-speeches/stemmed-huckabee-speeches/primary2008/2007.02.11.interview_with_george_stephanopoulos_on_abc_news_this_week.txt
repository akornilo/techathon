that econom develop __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so tax aren't alwai the root of all evil __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ when peopl sai we shouldn't have ani tax __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ when you dial __NUM__ and your hous is on fire __PUNCT__ you want a fire truck to come __PUNCT__
guess what pai for it __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__
what american don't want is unfair __PUNCT__ unnecessari __PUNCT__ exception high tax where the monei is wast __PUNCT__
but american understand that __PUNCT__ if you have the garbag pickup __PUNCT__ or the fire truck and polic car out there __PUNCT__ or for that matter if you have a highwai __PUNCT__ then it got to be paid for __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so how doe that extend __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ to the job you have to do as presid __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a lot of your oppon in thi race ar sign thi pledg __PUNCT__ the american for tax reform taxpay protect pledg __PUNCT__ basic sai we go to oppos ani effort to increas the incom tax __PUNCT__
you haven't sign it __PUNCT__
do you think it a gimmick __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ it not necessarili a gimmick __PUNCT__ and i mai decid i will sign it __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ what i want to make sure is that i don't assign someth that sai that if we had a catastroph incid __PUNCT__ a world war __PUNCT__ which i think we in the middl of or at least in the begin of alreadi __PUNCT__ i don't want to put myself in a box and make a pledg to an interest group that isn't realli as sacr as the pledg that i would make to the peopl of the countri to uphold the constitut __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ you talk about the fact that you believ we in world war iii right now __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ i do __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ in your speech earlier __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ clip of huckabe __PUNCT__ we do have a war __PUNCT__ a world war that is on fire and we have to recogn that the next presid must face that and must face it clearli and must understand it theolog base __PUNCT__
how do you fight a worldwid religi war without turn it into a __NUM__ centuri crusad __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ i think you have to be veri care that we don't think that our goal is to take our religion and impos it on somebodi els __PUNCT__
that not what thi war is about __PUNCT__
but we have to understand it from the point of the islam fascist who realli would like to annihil us __PUNCT__
i think you have to take serious that thi is __PUNCT__ at heart __PUNCT__ an effort where thei believ that god ha put them on thi planet so that thei will bring a complet cleans of all the infidel __PUNCT__ which thei consid us to be __PUNCT__
and the onli cleans that can realli be done is not to isol us to our part of the world __PUNCT__ but is to annihil us __PUNCT__
that why thi is such a more danger situat __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so how doe the presid combat that __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think part of it ha to happen from that we don't combat it by ourselv __PUNCT__
there got to be a sens in which the balanc of moder muslim will have to take a more visibl and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ vocal role in bring a sens of balanc and saniti within the islam commun __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but how do we encourag that __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ we encourag it by the same wai that we saw a lot of thing happen that chang to soviet union __PUNCT__ when thei realiz we not monster __PUNCT__ when thei realiz that we realli aren't out to destroi them __PUNCT__
there ar mani of the true muslim peopl that don't want a world war __PUNCT__
thei don't want a war __PUNCT__ a war in a world where __PUNCT__ everi dai __PUNCT__ somebodi ha to just be vapor __PUNCT__
we have to hope that that take hold within those commun themselv __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ georg will sai voter thi year ar go to hold candid to what he call the seven __PUNCT__ minut test __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ clip of georg will __PUNCT__ nightmar scenario __PUNCT__

that seven minut __PUNCT__
which candid fit the seven minut question __PUNCT__ how can you convinc voter that you the candid to pass that test __PUNCT__ you onli serv as governor of arkansa __PUNCT__

democrat __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ thi is the post __PUNCT__ 9/11 world where we in world war iii __PUNCT__ by your admiss __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ it is __PUNCT__ but it still is the same type of situat where what you realli have in the case of a leader is not so much where he been __PUNCT__ but what hi oper system is __PUNCT__ what hi judgment is __PUNCT__
doe he handl crisi __PUNCT__ can he assimil fact quickli and __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ can he commun __PUNCT__ and is he decis __PUNCT__ these ar qualiti __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ that come from be a governor __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ what is the closest you have you have ever come __PUNCT__ what the most difficult question you ever had to handl that is even close to respond to an attack on the __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think there have been sever that __PUNCT__ noth is close __PUNCT__ mayb __PUNCT__ to world war __PUNCT__ but when katrina hit the gulf shore __PUNCT__ we had __NUM__ evacue that came to arkansa __PUNCT__
our popul increas __NUM__ percent in five dai __PUNCT__
we manag that in a wai that most of the nation didn't know __PUNCT__ but the on who did marvel at it __PUNCT__ becaus we didn't have the problem that mani other state had in try to assimil all of these evacue that came in suddenli __PUNCT__ unexpectedli __PUNCT__ and with noth but __PUNCT__ liter __PUNCT__ the dirti __PUNCT__ muddi cloth on their back __PUNCT__
and we did it by bring all of our resourc togeth __PUNCT__ marshal the troop of both the public and privat sector __PUNCT__ and take charg of a situat where it wa clear the feder govern wa in complet meltdown __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ i have look at everyth you said __PUNCT__

we need to give him time to let it work __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so if you were in the senat __PUNCT__ you vote for the plan __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ i would give him a chanc __PUNCT__
you bet i would __PUNCT__
but here what i would also do __PUNCT__
i would caution the presid __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ you cannot continu to overstress these nation guard and reserv troop __PUNCT__
and that what worri me __PUNCT__
if we have a worn __PUNCT__ out armi and we have a worn __PUNCT__ out reserv forc __PUNCT__ what do we do when someth break loos in iran __PUNCT__ russia __PUNCT__ venezuela __PUNCT__ north korea __PUNCT__ stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ the question is __PUNCT__ how much time do we have __PUNCT__ and you wrote in your book that we should set a timet for the iraqi __PUNCT__
what would your timet be __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i wa care not to sai there should be a specif timet __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i said it like a basebal game __PUNCT__ not a footbal game __PUNCT__
you can't put it on a specif clock __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but you said you have to give the iraqi a timet for progress __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ we have to tell them __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we not go to be here indefinit __PUNCT__
what we go to expect of you is __PUNCT__ you go to have to get control of thi sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ thi civil war that is just rip thi whole thing apart __PUNCT__
becaus the american peopl ar not go to stai indefinit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when i sai a timet __PUNCT__ i want to be veri care that you don't just sai __PUNCT__ ok __PUNCT__ __DATE__ that the last dai __PUNCT__ we start pull out the helicopt and fly awai __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but you know __PUNCT__ realist __PUNCT__ aren't we realli on a timet becaus of the polit situat here at home __PUNCT__ i think about __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ __NUM__ month or so awai from the new hampshir primari __PUNCT__
if the situat in iraq doesn't improv by the time voter here go to the poll __PUNCT__ won't thei be clamor for anti __PUNCT__ war candid __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ it all depend on how thing go over the next year __PUNCT__
if thing continu to go with the sectarian violenc __PUNCT__ and the sunni and the shia ar just at each and bawl __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__ each other up __PUNCT__ i think we in for a veri __PUNCT__ veri rug season __PUNCT__
and it go to be tough __PUNCT__ if somebodi take ani posit other than what __PUNCT__ just __PUNCT__ cut our loss and go __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ let talk about immigr __PUNCT__
i wa struck by someth in usa todai thi morn __PUNCT__ a headlin that sai __PUNCT__ immigr becom kkk ralli point __PUNCT__
you said that you believ that there is some racism behind the immigr debat todai __PUNCT__
what did you mean by that __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i didn't mean that everybodi who ha some anxieti about immigr is a racist __PUNCT__
and that wa on of those thing that suddenli blew up and peopl said __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ he accus us all of be racist __PUNCT__
absolut not __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of peopl who ar concern __PUNCT__
i concern __PUNCT__
i concern that our border ar porou and we allow peopl to come in and out without ani real check as to who thei ar __PUNCT__ where thei go __PUNCT__ why thei here __PUNCT__ do thei have a communic diseas or a crimin background __PUNCT__ we need to know those thing __PUNCT__
i not as worri about somebodi who come across to pluck a chicken or pick a tomato or make a better laquinta __PUNCT__
i particularli concern about somebodi who might cross thi border with a shoulder __PUNCT__ fire missil __PUNCT__
but even those peopl who ar come to pluck chicken and pick tomato __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ i want them to come in an orderli wai __PUNCT__
i want them to cross the border legal __PUNCT__
when i go to the littl rock airport __PUNCT__ i have to go through all kind of hoop just to get on the airplan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thei know who i am __PUNCT__
thei all call me by name __PUNCT__ but i still show a photo i.d __PUNCT__
i take my shoe off __PUNCT__ i take my comput out and i put on a differ littl basket __PUNCT__
i get my jacket off and the whole deal __PUNCT__
i don't mind that becaus that the wai i suppos to get on the plane __PUNCT__
but i go through sever layer of secur and authent my personhood with the proper document __PUNCT__
i a taxpai u. __PUNCT__ citizen __PUNCT__
i a person who been a public offici __PUNCT__ but i go through those layer __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ but you also said we go to be judg by how we treat the illeg who ar here right now __PUNCT__
huckabe __PUNCT__ we shouldn't have amnesti where we just sai __PUNCT__ fine __PUNCT__ everybodi good __PUNCT__ we go to let it go __PUNCT__
we should have a process where peopl can pai the penalti __PUNCT__ step up and accept respons for not be here legal __PUNCT__
but here the point __PUNCT__
the object is not to be punit __PUNCT__
the object is to make thing right __PUNCT__
right for us __PUNCT__
right for them __PUNCT__
and what i have object to in the past is when we ar punish the children for the law that mayb their parent have broken __PUNCT__
i do have a problem with that __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ governor romnei is consid sai that the children of illeg immigr shouldn't automat becom citizen __PUNCT__
what do you think about that __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ mayb that should be look at __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ if peopl ar rush across the border __PUNCT__ illeg __PUNCT__ deliv a babi and then sai __PUNCT__ whew __PUNCT__ now we here __PUNCT__
i think that a littl disingenu to the concept of realli be a natur __PUNCT__ born u. __PUNCT__ citizen __PUNCT__
but it not an issu that i have put a stake in the ground and said __PUNCT__ thi is how we ought to handl it __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ let me ask you anoth question about governor romnei __PUNCT__
hi religion __PUNCT__ he a mormon __PUNCT__ ha becom __PUNCT__ is go to becom a big part of thi campaign __PUNCT__ clearli __PUNCT__
you a southern baptist __PUNCT__ a former southern baptist preacher __PUNCT__

how bit a hurdl is that go to be for governor romnei in thi campaign __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i not sure __PUNCT__
and i don't know that anyon know __PUNCT__
what i can tell you is about my faith and what it mean __PUNCT__
and i think peopl ought to look at everi person who run for offic and thei ought to ask them question about who thei ar and what thei ar about and what drive their decis __PUNCT__
i not as troubl by a person who ha a differ faith __PUNCT__
i troubl by a person who tell me their faith doesn't influenc their decis __PUNCT__
becaus if a person sai to me __PUNCT__ here my faith __PUNCT__ but it doesn't influenc me at all __PUNCT__ what it sai to me is __PUNCT__ my faith isn't veri signific __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ how doe it influenc your __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ it total drive it __PUNCT__
it make everyth click for me __PUNCT__
and that will explain to you why i have a passion for life __PUNCT__
but it mean that my pro __PUNCT__ life posit doesn't end at the birth canal __PUNCT__ that i believ that life is more than a gestat period __PUNCT__
i believ life begin at concept __PUNCT__ i just don't think it end at birth __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ as a governor __PUNCT__ i fourth hard to see children have medic insur and decent school and safe neighborhood and drink water and afford hous __PUNCT__ becaus that consist with me be pro __PUNCT__ life __PUNCT__
i don't want to see some singl mom __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ worri and struggl that she not go to be abl to have food for her kid __PUNCT__
i don't want some wife to have the daylight beaten out of her by some abus husband and have nowher to turn __PUNCT__
those ar thing that ar driven becaus of my faith __PUNCT__
that not a polit posit __PUNCT__
it a faith posit __PUNCT__
stephanopoulo __PUNCT__ mayor giuliani said he hate abort __PUNCT__ but he pro __PUNCT__ choic __PUNCT__
is that posit a game __PUNCT__ ender in the republican primari __PUNCT__ huckabe __PUNCT__ we find out in thi elect __PUNCT__ it look like __PUNCT__ becaus it go to be an issu that will clearli separ some of the candid __PUNCT__

we ar a cultur and a civil that celebr life __PUNCT__
we cherish our children live __PUNCT__
we griev when thei die __PUNCT__
i think it is the great contrast between us and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ the islam fascist __PUNCT__ who would strap a bomb to their own children chest and march them into a room full of innoc peopl and blow them up and then be proud of their children martyrdom __PUNCT__ and think somehow that that a great thing and it go to give them a special place in heaven __PUNCT__

the other tragedi is that it __PUNCT__ sort of __PUNCT__ took everyth els off the front page and took all the oxygen out of the room __PUNCT__
here we ar in the midst of iraq and immigr and all the issu that peopl face __PUNCT__ with whether thei go to have a job at the end of the week and whether their pension go to be eaten up by some time white __PUNCT__ collar crimin who will rob the compani of the monei and leav peopl with noth who have built the wealth __PUNCT__
