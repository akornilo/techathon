i newt gingrich and i want to report to you that if we unleash the american peopl __PUNCT__ we can be at the begin of an extraordinari era where we rebuild the america that we love __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when i sai unleash the american peopl __PUNCT__ i mean liter get the govern to stop crippl our effort to creat a better futur __PUNCT__
thi is a big topic __PUNCT__
it is on i am go to come back to again and again __PUNCT__ in the next few week __PUNCT__
but i want to start with a part of it that relat to nation secur __PUNCT__ relat to your person famili budget __PUNCT__ relat to the economi __PUNCT__ and relat to balanc the feder budget __PUNCT__ all four in on topic __PUNCT__
and it come down to a simpl idea __PUNCT__ what if we had a program that enabl the american peopl to develop so much new energi that we were __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ no longer reliant on saudi arabia __PUNCT__ iraq __PUNCT__ iran __PUNCT__
we didn't care what the iranian did in the strait of hormuz becaus we were safe __PUNCT__ in nation secur term __PUNCT__
what if that new energi program creat well over a million new job __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__ job that put american back to work and kept the monei here at home that we had been send oversea __PUNCT__ give us a dramat improv in our balanc of payment __PUNCT__ strengthen the dollar and give us a chanc to live much freer and more independ __PUNCT__ what if that veri idea also meant that we have dramat increas in feder revenu in the govern without a tax increas but that __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the feder govern would have liter an entir new stream of monei __PUNCT__ and final __PUNCT__ what if that big new idea meant that you person were better off becaus you ar bui gasolin for __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__ not for __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ as what some peopl project by the summer could be __MONEY__ or more __PUNCT__ how is that possibl __PUNCT__ you ask __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that is what is excit __PUNCT__ and that is on of the reason i run for presid __PUNCT__
i know that scienc __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ entrepreneurship have made tremend progress __PUNCT__
and i know that the politician in washington __PUNCT__ the old __PUNCT__ time establish __PUNCT__ the elit new media __PUNCT__ the bureaucrat don't have a clue what possibl __PUNCT__ or in some case __PUNCT__ thei have a clue and thei ar oppos to it __PUNCT__
and i want to cover both of those in the next few minut __PUNCT__
but let start with a histor fact that i think is go to chang our understand of america futur and our understand of the energi possibl __PUNCT__
that fact is call north dakota __PUNCT__
in north dakota __PUNCT__ there is a format call the bakken format __PUNCT__
it ha a tremend amount of oil __PUNCT__
it ha much more oil than the us geolog survei us to think __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ base on on us geolog survei studi __PUNCT__ there is now __NUM__ time as much oil as there wa back when thei first estim it __PUNCT__ not __NUM__ percent more __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent more __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason we know thi is __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ veri illustr of what is wrong with america __PUNCT__
we know the bakken format exist in north dakota becaus it is on privat land __PUNCT__ and liber weren't abl to block us from develop it __PUNCT__
so the peopl __PUNCT__ the entrepreneur __PUNCT__ the busi leader who went in and develop that format __PUNCT__ thei began to produc more and more oil __PUNCT__
as on of them said __PUNCT__ thei now find that almost everywher thei look __PUNCT__ there is more oil __PUNCT__
what the result __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the offici unemploy rate in north dakota is __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ but that mai actual be mislead becaus most of that __NUM__ percent don't have the right train __PUNCT__
it turn out that north dakota boom to such an extent that there is __NUM__ to __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__ good job __PUNCT__ __NUM__ to __NUM__ dollar __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ year job that aren't fill becaus the folk who need a job aren't train __PUNCT__ and the folk __PUNCT__ the job thei need __PUNCT__ don't have peopl fill them __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
what would that be like in your hometown if the boom wa so big that there were __NUM__ to __NUM__ unfil job __PUNCT__ how much better off would we be __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ when you have that kind of econom growth __PUNCT__ you have an increas in revenu to the govern __PUNCT__
so the state govern of north dakota ha had seven consecut tax cut __PUNCT__ and it now ha a raini dai fund of sever billion dollar __PUNCT__ even though the entir state budget is onli about __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
so energi can lead to a bigger economi __PUNCT__ more revenu for the govern __PUNCT__ better job for peopl __PUNCT__
now let step all the wai back and look at the other __NUM__ state and look at the ocean around the unit state __PUNCT__
if north dakota ha that much energi __PUNCT__ how much do we think we have everywher els __PUNCT__ turn out __PUNCT__ we mai have more oil in the unit state todai __PUNCT__ given new scienc and new technolog than we have actual pump worldwid sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we mai __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ by on estim have three time as much oil in the unit state as there is in saudi arabia __PUNCT__
and rememb __PUNCT__ right now i am just talk about oil which were relat directli to gasolin __PUNCT__ but there ha been a parallel revolut in natur ga __PUNCT__
in the natur ga __PUNCT__ we knew that technic there wa a lot of ga in shale __PUNCT__ but we did not know how to get it out __PUNCT__
and peopl thought given the amount that could be recov __PUNCT__ as recent as the year __NUM__ thei thought that natur ga wa a declin commod __PUNCT__
it wa a perfect exampl of what ha been call __PUNCT__ peak product __PUNCT__ we have alreadi us up over half of it __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ as recent as about __NUM__ peopl thought there wa about seven year suppli left __PUNCT__
thei were liter talk about get liquefi natur ga out of the middl east __PUNCT__ put it in giant refriger ship __PUNCT__ bring it to the us __PUNCT__ unload it here __PUNCT__ becaus the chemic industri __PUNCT__ in particular __PUNCT__ need the ga __PUNCT__
all of a sudden __PUNCT__ somebodi had a realli bright idea __PUNCT__
thei took a technolog which had been develop for ocean drill __PUNCT__ becaus ocean platform ar realli expens __PUNCT__ and so when you drill on rig on the ocean platform __PUNCT__ you want it to go as mani place as you can __PUNCT__
so thei develop realli brilliant techniqu for go out horizont __PUNCT__
thei come down with on __PUNCT__ and then it goe out in everi direct __PUNCT__
and all of a sudden somebodi figur out __PUNCT__ gee __PUNCT__ if you could do that with natur ga and at the same time __PUNCT__ if you could fractur the rock in a wai by us steam and water that you could actual get the ga to come into on collect point __PUNCT__ you could get a lot of ga out of the shale __PUNCT__
the net result wa that we now have in shale tremend amount of natur ga that is recover __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the most recent estim is that we mai have over a hundr year suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
in on short decad __PUNCT__ we went from seven year suppli to over a hundr year suppli becaus scienc and technolog had improv so much __PUNCT__
furthermor __PUNCT__ instead of us import liquefi natur ga from the middl east __PUNCT__ there is now seriou talk that we go to build facil in houston __PUNCT__ and we go to ship liquefi natur ga to china __PUNCT__
so we will be make monei export natur ga where peopl thought we would be give up monei __NUM__ year ago import natur ga __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what doe thi mean __PUNCT__ it mean in place like the marcellu shale in western pennsylvania __PUNCT__ in the area of eastern ohio __PUNCT__ cut down all along the appalachian __PUNCT__ all the wai out to dalla __PUNCT__ texa __PUNCT__ there is format after format after format __PUNCT__
and the result is not just monei for big oil __PUNCT__ but peopl who own the properti __PUNCT__ farmer __PUNCT__
i have talk sever year ago with governor jindal of louisiana who just had run into a farmer who suddenli discov that he had natur ga on hi farm and he had been given an amazingli big check by the natur ga compani __PUNCT__ and do so he wa veri happi to find out that he had a better incom __PUNCT__ he wa go to get royalti __PUNCT__ and therefor __PUNCT__ the local economi around shreveport wa realli begin to grow __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i give you that background becaus these new scienc __PUNCT__ these new technolog and the entrepreneur who us them ar give us dramat new opportun __PUNCT__
thi realli matter for some veri practic reason __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ sinc the mid __PUNCT__ 1970 __PUNCT__ we known that the arab state and iran combin have domin oil product and have us their leverag to rais the cost of oil and to bring polit pressur to bear on the american and on the european __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i want to get to a point where we produc so much oil in the unit state that no american presid will ever again bow to a saudi king __PUNCT__
i thought __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ it time that we tell the saudi the truth __PUNCT__ we know that thei ar the largest funder of school call madrassa __PUNCT__ which teach hate __PUNCT__
we know that thei spend sever billion dollar a year export a veri __PUNCT__ veri extrem version call wahhab __PUNCT__ and we know that thei ar not straight with us __PUNCT__
and up until now __PUNCT__ our presid have been too cautiou to sai __PUNCT__ oh gee __PUNCT__ i don't want to offend the saudi __PUNCT__
i don't want them to do someth with their oil suppli __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we have an opportun now to turn that around __PUNCT__
we have an opportun to build up the american oil suppli __PUNCT__ the american natur ga suppli __PUNCT__ so we can then tell the saudi the truth __PUNCT__ so we can deal with them from a posit of strength __PUNCT__ so we can no longer worri about the persian gulf __PUNCT__
and at that point __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the iranian want to do someth with the strait of hormuz __PUNCT__ mayb the chines have a problem or the indian have a problem or the european have a problem __PUNCT__
but i am not sure at that point that the american will have a problem if we becom onc again what we were in world war ii __PUNCT__ the lead produc of oil in the world __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ there is at least on studi alreadi out there sai by __NUM__ if we do the right thing __PUNCT__ we will produc more oil than either russia or saudi arabia __PUNCT__ and we will regain __PUNCT__ by the end of the decad __PUNCT__ be the lead produc of oil in the world __PUNCT__
what i want to do is acceler that for a coupl of reason __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ to get thi economi back on track __PUNCT__
if you had __MONEY__ billion a year that wa not go oversea __PUNCT__ that wa pai royalti in the us __PUNCT__ pai landown __PUNCT__ pai peopl to go out and develop the oil __PUNCT__ pain in the pipelin builder __PUNCT__ you would suddenli have a realli boom economi right here at home __PUNCT__
we have an opportun to realli help our economi __PUNCT__
there is a second part __PUNCT__ everi time ga price go up __PUNCT__ thei ar the equival of a tax on work american and retir american __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__ you go to the ga station __PUNCT__
if you ar pai __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__ you have a lot less monei left each week than if you ar pai __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
now __MONEY__ mai sound like it is an imposs number __PUNCT__ but that balonei __PUNCT__
when i wa speaker of the hous __PUNCT__ we paid __MONEY__ on averag dure the four year that i wa speaker __PUNCT__
when barack obama becam presid __PUNCT__ we paid __MONEY__ that week __PUNCT__
but the obama administr is so anti __PUNCT__ oil __PUNCT__ so anti __PUNCT__ ga __PUNCT__ so anti __PUNCT__ fossil fuel in gener __PUNCT__ includ coal that basic their view is __PUNCT__ if we have lot of fuel __PUNCT__ thei don't want it __PUNCT__
thei ar prepar to do almost anyth to stop the develop of these kind of program __PUNCT__
you mai think i exagger __PUNCT__ but let me give you an exampl __PUNCT__
in north dakota where the develop ar on privat land __PUNCT__ so the liber have not been abl to stop them __PUNCT__ the obama us attornei for north dakota file a lawsuit becaus eight migratori bird had been found dead near oil field __PUNCT__
now i want you to think about thi __PUNCT__ thousand of migratori bird ar kill everi year by wind turbin __PUNCT__
but wind turbin ar on of presid obama favorit altern fuel __PUNCT__ so thei ar green __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ although thei kill bird __PUNCT__ thei ar green so thei ar good even though what thei ar do mai not be good __PUNCT__
and i happen to think wind is a legitim sourc of energi __PUNCT__ and i have notic often __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ that iowa produc __NUM__ percent of it electr from wind __PUNCT__ the second larger produc in the world after denmark __PUNCT__
so i am not anti __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ but i think it is fascin __PUNCT__ the select prosecut of oil compani over eight bird becaus the ideolog radic in the obama administr so deepli dislik us oil __PUNCT__
you have the same challeng with the wai in which we now fractur __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ frack __PUNCT__ and the obama administr ha liter assembl multipl agenc to hold workshop to try to figur out how to stop it __PUNCT__
it is almost as though anyth which succe __PUNCT__ anyth which enabl american to have a better life with more incom __PUNCT__ with less expens energi is somehow bad __PUNCT__
to show you how far thi is go __PUNCT__ even though we have todai the highest price averag cost of gasolin in histori __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ presid obama ha taken us from __MONEY__ to the most expens gasolin on averag we have ever had __PUNCT__
thei ar still not satisfi __PUNCT__
the environment protect agenc under presid obama ha a propos for a brand __PUNCT__ new regul that would __PUNCT__ on averag __PUNCT__ rais the cost of gasolin anoth __MONEY__
and that is still not enough __PUNCT__ secretari of energi __PUNCT__ secretari chu __PUNCT__ who in mani wai ought to be call the secretari of anti __PUNCT__ energi said befor he wa name secretari __PUNCT__ he realli want american gasolin price to reach the european level __PUNCT__
that would be __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
now you have two be somebodi who doe not understand america if you think the peopl who live in a state like montana __PUNCT__ washington state __PUNCT__ idaho __PUNCT__ minnesota __PUNCT__ for that matter michigan __PUNCT__
look at the distanc you drive from detroit to go up to mackinac island or to go to the upper peninsula __PUNCT__
look at the distanc you drive in arizona or in my home state of georgia __PUNCT__ the largest state east of the mississippi __PUNCT__ the distanc from atlanta to sea island or the distanc from albani up to north georgia __PUNCT__ to dalton __PUNCT__
i think there ar a lot of academ liber __PUNCT__ and dr __PUNCT__ chu is on of them __PUNCT__ who live on a nice campu and thei live will bicycl to their lab __PUNCT__
thei have no idea how the averag american work __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ he is a good case for abolish the depart of energi __PUNCT__
we have had on sinc jimmi carter creat it after the oil shock __PUNCT__ and it doe not work veri well __PUNCT__
it ha __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ hurt the entir process of find energi __PUNCT__
with investor like solyndra __PUNCT__ it is open to charg of corrupt __PUNCT__
i think we would be much better off to abolish the depart of energi and creat the right rule and the right approach __PUNCT__
now let me give you some exampl of what i mean by that __PUNCT__
under presid obama __PUNCT__ becaus he is so anti __PUNCT__ american energi __PUNCT__ we have actual had a __NUM__ percent reduct in develop of oil offshor __PUNCT__ and we have had a __NUM__ percent reduct in the develop of oil on feder land __PUNCT__
thi is the exact opposit of what we should be do __PUNCT__
what we should do and what i will do as your presid is i will author the develop of offshor __PUNCT__ as long as it is far enough out that it is not visibl __PUNCT__ and it is not a threat to tourism or the fisheri __PUNCT__
and i will author the develop of feder land that ar appropri __PUNCT__
and think about thi __PUNCT__ we own __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__ own __NUM__ percent of nevada __PUNCT__
that an area __NUM__ percent the size of texa __PUNCT__
and mine is the second __PUNCT__ largest employ in nevada __PUNCT__
if the feder govern were more will to open up part of nevada __PUNCT__ we would have a lot more job __PUNCT__
we own __NUM__ percent of alaska __PUNCT__
alaska is __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ twice the size of texa __PUNCT__
that mean we own on and a half texas __PUNCT__
so you can offer the environmentalist half of texa __PUNCT__ __NUM__ squar mile __PUNCT__
thei can take nation park __PUNCT__ polar bear area __PUNCT__ walru area __PUNCT__ glacier __PUNCT__ an area half the size of texa __PUNCT__
that would leav us for develop for look for oil __PUNCT__ for ga __PUNCT__ for coal __PUNCT__ for miner __PUNCT__ an area liter the size of texa that is current undevelop __PUNCT__
so when i suggest to you with the new technolog __PUNCT__ with the new abil to have veri sophist seismic explor to target where the reservoir of oil and ga ar __PUNCT__ with the abil to go out and have veri sophist and effici method of go down and find them __PUNCT__ we could have an explos of new energi __PUNCT__ new sourc __PUNCT__ and new capac __PUNCT__
there no reason we cannot set three goal __PUNCT__ becom energi independ for nation secur reason __PUNCT__ develop enough new energi here at home that would creat well __PUNCT__ over a million job in the next few year __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__ veri us job __PUNCT__ job which by the wai __PUNCT__ increas our manufactur base becaus much of energi product requir manufactur product in order to both drill __PUNCT__ due process __PUNCT__ to transport __PUNCT__ third __PUNCT__ by us feder properti and by allow offshor develop on feder control water __PUNCT__ we get paid a royalti __PUNCT__
on of the lead expert on north dakota ha suggest that we might well have over the next gener __NUM__ trillion __PUNCT__ not billion __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion in royalti that we could gather for the feder govern with no tax increas __PUNCT__
and in fact to acceler that __PUNCT__ i propos the follow tax chang __PUNCT__
i propos we go to zero capit gain tax __PUNCT__ so hundr of billion of dollar pour into the unit state to enabl us to have new invest __PUNCT__ new factori __PUNCT__ new explor __PUNCT__ new compani __PUNCT__
i suggest a __NUM__ a half percent corpor tax rate would liber about __MONEY__ billion in oversea profit to bring them back home to be reinvest and to allow our compani to compet everywher in the world __PUNCT__
i also propos that we abolish the death tax perman __PUNCT__ so that we ar in a posit where famili busi can focu on job creation and ar be success __PUNCT__ not on hide from the ir __PUNCT__
i also propos that we have __NUM__ percent expens __PUNCT__
and what that mean is __PUNCT__ when you invest in new equip __PUNCT__ you write it off in on year __PUNCT__
now that is realli import becaus it mean if we ar go to go out and find new oil __PUNCT__ we go to move the oil with pipelin __PUNCT__ we could make it veri desir to develop energi in america and to develop manufactur in america __PUNCT__ so that the energi compani would be bui from american manufactur __PUNCT__
and you would __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ rebuild our machin tool industri and rebuild our industri that suppli good and servic __PUNCT__
i wa in a compani that make forklift __PUNCT__ xtreme manufactur __PUNCT__ in la vega __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ and thei were look forward to the keyston pipelin becaus thei were build the forklift in nevada that were go to be us to build the pipelin __PUNCT__
so there ar job all over the countri date back into thi reemerg __PUNCT__
i guarante you that as your presid on the veri first dai __PUNCT__ i will sign an execut order approv the keyston pipelin so that oil can come from canada through the unit state to houston and galveston __PUNCT__
that wai we will have __NUM__ to __NUM__ new job build the pipelin __PUNCT__ and for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we will have peopl work to maintain the pipelin __PUNCT__ we will have peopl work to process and refin the all product and to ship them out of the port of galveston and houston __PUNCT__
it is a win __PUNCT__ win program __PUNCT__
i am dedic to make sure that the canadian do not have to have a partnership with china to build a pipelin due west across the rocki __PUNCT__
i want them to have the less expens __PUNCT__ more effect __PUNCT__ and frankli __PUNCT__ more pro __PUNCT__ american pipelin that come right down to houston and enabl us to make monei with our canadian neighbor in a wai that is posit for both countri and help us increas our nation secur __PUNCT__
so these ar veri practic step we can take __PUNCT__
a presid who is will to replac the environ protect agenc with a brand __PUNCT__ new environment solut agenc dedic to common sens __PUNCT__ to scienc and technolog __PUNCT__ to innov and to be econom ration __PUNCT__
a presid dedic to open up offshor so that we can develop the maximum amount of american oil and ga right here at home __PUNCT__
a presid will to us feder land where appropri __PUNCT__ not nation park __PUNCT__ not area of great beauti __PUNCT__ but we have million of acr that we can allow to be develop in a wai that will be good for america __PUNCT__ good for our economi __PUNCT__ good for our nation secur __PUNCT__
a deliber strategi to bring down the price of gasolin to __MONEY__ a gallon or less so that you can afford to bui the kind of car you want __PUNCT__
and rememb __PUNCT__ onc we prove there is no __PUNCT__ peak oil __PUNCT__ onc we prove that __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ there is a huge volum of energi out there that we can develop if we ar will to do it __PUNCT__ there is no reason to have cafe standard __PUNCT__
cafe standard were adopt for automobil as a respons to the arab embargo in the 1970 __PUNCT__
but if we go to produc plenti of energi __PUNCT__ let the american peopl by the car or truck thei want __PUNCT__
we don't need thi meddlesom washington bureaucraci and washington politician dictat to the rest of us what we should do and how we should live __PUNCT__
peopl __PUNCT__ if thei go to work and thei earn a live and thei pai their tax __PUNCT__ when it is their take __PUNCT__ home pai __PUNCT__ it ought to be their decis __PUNCT__
and thei ought to have the freedom to drive what you want to and thei ought to have the freedom to enjoi the thing thei want to enjoi __PUNCT__
and thei should not be told by some washington bureaucrat or some washington politician what thei have to do __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ if we elimin the cafe standard __PUNCT__ all of our auto compani ar go to be healthier overnight __PUNCT__
the american peopl repli to bureaucrat meddl by move from full __PUNCT__ size car when thei were outlaw to truck __PUNCT__
so the effect wasn't to have us go to smaller vehicl __PUNCT__ it wa just to shift us out of car into truck __PUNCT__
and i think we need to understand the american peopl realli ar proud about their right to choos the wai thei want to live without politician and bureaucrat tell them what to do __PUNCT__
and i will sai final __PUNCT__ if we do all of thi __PUNCT__ the amount of monei we ar go to gener is go to enabl us to move toward a balanc budget __PUNCT__ if we control spend __PUNCT__ if we modern the feder govern __PUNCT__ if we adopt anti __PUNCT__ fraud procedur __PUNCT__ if we abolish a coupl of depart __PUNCT__
if we take the tenth amend project that governor rick perri ha agre to head up __PUNCT__ and we return power back to state and local govern __PUNCT__
those thing will enabl us to move back toward a balanc budget __PUNCT__
i know thi can be done __PUNCT__ becaus when i wa speaker of the hous __PUNCT__ i work with presid bill clinton and pass the __NUM__ balanc budget act and out of that came four consecut balanc budget __PUNCT__
we paid off __MONEY__ billion in debt __PUNCT__
so when i look at the scale of the obama deficit __PUNCT__ the amount of monei he is throw awai __PUNCT__ the wast us of hi credit card __PUNCT__ i know that we can do better __PUNCT__
and i know that if we open up american energi __PUNCT__ think about the thing that happen simultan __PUNCT__
we get a lot more job __PUNCT__ that is __PUNCT__ peopl that come off of unemploy __PUNCT__ thei come off of food stamp __PUNCT__ thei come off of welfar __PUNCT__ thei come off of public hous __PUNCT__ thei come off of medicaid __PUNCT__
all that save us monei __PUNCT__
and thei go to work take care of their famili and pai tax __PUNCT__
so govern revenu goe up __PUNCT__ govern expens go down __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i know that when we develop thi __PUNCT__ the compani ar go to make more profit __PUNCT__ so thei ar go to pai more tax back __PUNCT__
and i know that the royalti that we ar go to get from feder land and from offshor develop is go to pour in by the billion __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ if the estim from north dakota ar right __PUNCT__ it could liter be pour in at the rate of __MONEY__ billion or more a year of increas royalti without a tax increas __PUNCT__
so there ar a lot of posit thing that can come __PUNCT__ all simultan __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ as a nation secur matter __PUNCT__ it allow us to sai to the all develop dictat __PUNCT__ whether thei ar venezuela __PUNCT__ saudi arabia __PUNCT__ iran __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__ that we ar go to be stand on our own two feet __PUNCT__
that the unit state is not go to bow to anybodi __PUNCT__ we ar not go to be blackmail by anybodi __PUNCT__ and as we get to a balanc __PUNCT__ budget __PUNCT__ we go to start pai down our debt __PUNCT__ pai off the chines held bond __PUNCT__ so that we can becom truli onc again independ and abl to do what we believ in on our term __PUNCT__ without have to deal with the kind of pressur you might get into even if there is somebodi hold onto your oil or becaus thei hold onto your u. __PUNCT__ treasuri note __PUNCT__
either on is a form of leverag over us and weaken us __PUNCT__
i believ it is veri import that we take advantag of thi __PUNCT__
but notic what my outlin for you __PUNCT__
here is a whole new approach __PUNCT__
it is posit __PUNCT__
it is excit __PUNCT__
it mean you will have more monei in your pocket becaus at __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__ you can figur out for yourself what doe that save you annual __PUNCT__ and if you ar a famili that ha sever car or sever truck __PUNCT__ it save you a lot __PUNCT__
if you ar an independ trucker __PUNCT__ it save you a whole lot of monei __PUNCT__
if you live in a town where truck ar bring your groceri and thei ar bring thing to your local mall __PUNCT__ you ar go to save monei __PUNCT__
everi time you can lower the cost of energi __PUNCT__ you make it easier for us to have manufactur and you lower the cost of live __PUNCT__
it is a win __PUNCT__ win environ __PUNCT__
you also know that if you do thi __PUNCT__ we have a lot more job __PUNCT__ and we need a grow economi with a lot of new job __PUNCT__ becaus we want to be a countri where america work best when american ar work __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri of food stamp and welfar __PUNCT__
we ar a countri of the work ethic __PUNCT__ of a job __PUNCT__ of take __PUNCT__ home pai __PUNCT__ of open up our own busi __PUNCT__
and thi kind of energi program will do just that __PUNCT__
i know it is differ __PUNCT__
i know a lot of folk in the establish will sai it is __PUNCT__ unrealist __PUNCT__
these ar the same peopl who said to presid reagan when he said __PUNCT__ we can defeat the soviet empir __PUNCT__ now be reason __PUNCT__
these ar the same peopl that when governor reagan __PUNCT__ presid reagan said __PUNCT__ first governor reagan as candid __PUNCT__ then presid reagan onc he won __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ if we cut tax __PUNCT__ we will creat job __PUNCT__
thei said __PUNCT__ that is __PUNCT__ voodoo econom __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he creat __NUM__ million new job dure hi presid __PUNCT__
i came back realli appli the same thing in __NUM__ with the __PUNCT__ contract with america __PUNCT__
and peopl said that is __PUNCT__ unrealist __PUNCT__
you ar not go to win control of the hous __PUNCT__
it not possibl __PUNCT__
no on ha done it in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
you can't balanc the budget __PUNCT__
you can't reform welfar __PUNCT__
