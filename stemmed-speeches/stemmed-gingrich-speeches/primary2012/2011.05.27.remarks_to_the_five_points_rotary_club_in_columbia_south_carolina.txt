thank you for allow me to join you todai to share some thought about the futur of our countri __PUNCT__
we have reach a moment of crisi in america __PUNCT__
more american ar without job __PUNCT__ and for longer period of time __PUNCT__ than at ani time sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ more peopl depend on assist from govern program than at ani other time in america histori __PUNCT__
solv thi crisi of unemploy and a grow and destruct depend on govern will requir the commit __PUNCT__ persever __PUNCT__ and hard work __PUNCT__ not of ani on man or woman __PUNCT__ but of american from everi walk of life who ar unit by a belief in freedom and self __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
in everi arena in which washington ha overstep it constitut boundari or grown too larg and ineffect __PUNCT__ we must reassert the principl that we the peopl ar the sourc of author __PUNCT__ power __PUNCT__ wealth __PUNCT__ and freedom in american societi __PUNCT__
to restor that relationship between the govern and the govern __PUNCT__ we must move power out of washington and return it to the american peopl __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ amend is the constitut reset mechan and in the cours of thi campaign i will prove that a return of power to the state and to the peopl base on the __NUM__ amend is urgent need todai __PUNCT__
thi mean reject a govern of we the bureaucrat and replac it with a govern of __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ and for the american peopl __PUNCT__
we must begin thi effort in two import wai __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ by reviv the american economi and set the condit for explos econom growth and job creation by cut tax __PUNCT__ deregul __PUNCT__ creat an american energi polici __PUNCT__ and cut spend __PUNCT__
and second __PUNCT__ by reassert the constitut and the rule of law __PUNCT__ which mean repeal obamacar __PUNCT__ and reassert the power of the peopl over corrupt and arbitrari decis make of govern offici and unaccount feder bureaucraci __PUNCT__
restor econom growth and put american back to work is actual the easier of these two task __PUNCT__
it start with a simpl organ principl __PUNCT__ job kill polici kill job __PUNCT__
we must identifi job __PUNCT__ kill polici __PUNCT__ and then end them or replac them with job creat polici __PUNCT__
america ha face recess befor and recov quickli __PUNCT__
sinc world war ii __PUNCT__ recess have last an averag of __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
the longest wa __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ forti month after the recess began __PUNCT__ unemploy is actual go back up __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ last month __PUNCT__
wors __PUNCT__ if you count those who have stop look for a job or ar work part time when thei would prefer to work full time __PUNCT__ the real unemploy rate is at a stagger __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the normal resili of the american economi is be held back by the destruct impact of big govern __PUNCT__
instead of try to creat job with wast stimulu spend __PUNCT__ we need a govern that get out of the wai and allow the american peopl to creat job and prosper again __PUNCT__
that start with cut tax __PUNCT__ deregul __PUNCT__ an american energi polici __PUNCT__ and cut spend __PUNCT__
we should continu what ha work by make the current tax rate perman and stop the __NUM__ tax increas __PUNCT__
next we must make america onc again the most desir countri in the world for job creat invest __PUNCT__
to do thi we need a bold seri of four tax cut __PUNCT__
we should elimin the capit gain tax __PUNCT__ turn the rate to zero __PUNCT__ as some of our intern competitor have done __PUNCT__ to make american entrepreneur more competit and to attract billion of new invest __PUNCT__
we should reduc america corpor tax rate __PUNCT__ now the highest in the industri world __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we should allow for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ expens of invest in new equip __PUNCT__ allow farmer __PUNCT__ factori __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ hospit and all busi to write off all new equip in on year __PUNCT__
thi will ensur that american worker can onc again emploi the most technolog advanc tool in the most advanc factori and be the most product in the world __PUNCT__
we should perman end the death tax and it doubl taxat on the lifetim save of american __PUNCT__
we also need sever pro __PUNCT__ growth regulatori reform that remov obstacl to job creation __PUNCT__
we should repeal the costli __PUNCT__ ineffect __PUNCT__ and job kill sarban oxlei act __PUNCT__
we should repeal the dodd __PUNCT__ frank bill which ha crippl commun bank and lend to small busi __PUNCT__
we should replac the job kill epa with an environment solut agenc __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we need an american energi polici that favor inexpens gasolin __PUNCT__ diesel __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ and electr __PUNCT__
inexpens american energi will lead to more job __PUNCT__ greater econom growth __PUNCT__ and wealthier american __PUNCT__
thi would seem to be an all too obviou goal for america __PUNCT__ the obama administr pursu explicit polici that lead to expens gasolin __PUNCT__ expens diesel __PUNCT__ expens natur ga __PUNCT__ and skyrocket electr cost __PUNCT__
these anti __PUNCT__ american energi polici ar kill job and make us all poorer __PUNCT__
we need an all __PUNCT__ out effort to increas domest oil and drill __PUNCT__ includ the develop of oil shale resourc in the american west __PUNCT__ where we have an estim three time as much oil as saudi arabia __PUNCT__
we have natur ga off south carolina which will creat job in south carolina and an export product for america __PUNCT__
new job will grow in the port of charleston around natur ga just as new job will grow in an off shore industri __PUNCT__ high pai __PUNCT__ high valu job __PUNCT__
we don't have to wait year for ga price to come down __PUNCT__
an aggress commit now to develop more of our abund oil and natur ga resourc will put downward pressur on price at the pump long befor ani new reserv actual come onlin __PUNCT__
that not wish think __PUNCT__
that call the law of suppli and demand __PUNCT__ which take into account todai what go to happen in the futur __PUNCT__
the combin of pro __PUNCT__ growth tax reform __PUNCT__ control spend __PUNCT__ a return to sound monei and an american energi plan will move us toward a veri dramat job growth with low inflat __PUNCT__ which is the best wai to move toward a balanc budget __PUNCT__ by get peopl off of unemploy __PUNCT__ off of medicaid __PUNCT__ off of food stamp __PUNCT__ get them back into earn a live and pai tax __PUNCT__
north dakota ha slice incom and corpor tax rate and ha __NUM__ __PUNCT__ unemploy __PUNCT__
texa in two of the last four year creat more job than the other __NUM__ state combin __PUNCT__
there is a lesson here __PUNCT__
low tax __PUNCT__ deregul __PUNCT__ an american energi polici __PUNCT__ and be in favor of peopl who ar entrepreneur __PUNCT__ who run small busi __PUNCT__ who go to work and creat job will end the recess and creat a boom in job __PUNCT__
now as i said __PUNCT__ creat job and grow the economi again is not the hard part __PUNCT__
what i have share with you is straight from the reagan playbook and we know it work __PUNCT__
but what reagan didn't have to confront __PUNCT__ but we have to confront todai __PUNCT__ and more so the citizen of south carolina __PUNCT__ is the systemat assault on the rule of law by thi administr __PUNCT__
there is to begin the blatantli unconstitut and unpreced expans of feder power by obamacar __PUNCT__ with it so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ individu mandat __PUNCT__
if the feder govern can coerc individu __PUNCT__ by threat of fine __PUNCT__ to bui health insur __PUNCT__ then there is no stop the feder govern from forc american to bui ani good or servic __PUNCT__
it would mean the end of limit govern as envis by our founder __PUNCT__
that why i have publicli support the effort of attornei gener cuccinelli of virginia in hi lawsuit and the __NUM__ attornei __PUNCT__ gener throughout the countri who have challeng the constitution of obamacar __PUNCT__ and why i will fight for the repeal of obamacar until it is repeal in it entireti __PUNCT__
it is the unpreced grant of over on thousand nine hundr discretionari power to unelect bureaucrat in the obamacar legisl that guarante the rise in arbitrari and corrupt decis __PUNCT__ make by the feder govern __PUNCT__
most of these discretionari power ar grant to the secretari of health and human servic and her bureaucraci __PUNCT__
the obamacar law also creat __NUM__ new board __PUNCT__ agenc and other govern entiti to administ health decis that should be instead up to the individu in consult with their doctor __PUNCT__
jame madison __PUNCT__ in the federalist paper __PUNCT__ underscor the import of the rule of law __PUNCT__ which he defin as govern exercis it power in predict and evenhand wai __PUNCT__ as a defens against tyranni __PUNCT__
it worth recal the grievanc contain in the declar of independ __PUNCT__ the veri grievanc that fire the furi of american patriot and justifi the american revolut __PUNCT__
the fact that the bulk of them __PUNCT__ twenti __PUNCT__ on out of twenti __PUNCT__ seven __PUNCT__ concern violat of the rule of law show that the founder believ the rule of law to be indispens to a just societi __PUNCT__
the found father would have immedi recogn the danger of so much arbitrari power invest in unelect bureaucrat __PUNCT__ like we find in obamacar __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ we ar alreadi see how the american belief in the rule of law is betrai in the implement of the presid new health care regim __PUNCT__
to date __PUNCT__ the obama administr ha issu over on thousand waiver to exempt compani and organ from compli with the law expens mandat __PUNCT__ includ big labor and other power support of the democrat parti __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ a report show nearli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the latest round of waiver ar in former hous speaker nanci pelosi congression district __PUNCT__
thi process provid glare proof of the corrupt natur of big govern and why our founder distrust central power __PUNCT__
here in south carolina you ar wit first hand and up close anoth glare proof of the corrupt natur of big govern and it abil to destroi job __PUNCT__
i speak __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ about the effort by the obama administr nation labor relat board to stop boe dreamlin plant from open up in charleston __PUNCT__
the fact ar well known by everybodi in south carolina and ar begin to be known across america __PUNCT__
south carolina is on of the twenti __PUNCT__ two right __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ work state in america __PUNCT__ where worker cannot be forc to join a union __PUNCT__
washington state __PUNCT__ where boe main product plant is locat __PUNCT__ is a compulsori union state __PUNCT__
the nlrb complaint __PUNCT__ which wa made on behalf of the machinist __PUNCT__ union in boe washington product plant __PUNCT__ come a full seventeen month after the compani announc their choic of charleston __PUNCT__
boe ha alreadi begun construct of the new facil and ha alreadi creat over __NUM__ job for south carolina __PUNCT__
in total __PUNCT__ the plant is expect to creat __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
thi illeg nlrb action put all those job at risk __PUNCT__
even bill gould __PUNCT__ who wa chairman of nlrb under presid clinton __PUNCT__ ha denounc the attack on boe as __PUNCT__ unpreced __PUNCT__
if the obama administr hand __PUNCT__ pick nlrb is success in block the open of the boe plant in south carolina __PUNCT__ it won't just be south carolina that suffer __PUNCT__
such a rule would put ten of million of futur job in all __NUM__ right __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ work state in jeopardi __PUNCT__
it would make it effect imposs for u. __PUNCT__ compani to choos to open new facil in right __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ work state if thei ar current locat in a state that allow forc union __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ a rule against boe would put job at risk in all fifti state by increas the flight of capit out of our countri __PUNCT__
mani compani __PUNCT__ if thei ar prevent from invest in right to work state __PUNCT__ will simpli look oversea __PUNCT__
it wouldn't save union job __PUNCT__
it would simpli prevent new job from be creat here in america __PUNCT__
face with our current slow econom growth __PUNCT__ we should be make it easier for compani and entrepreneur to creat job in the unit state __PUNCT__ not harder __PUNCT__
thi complaint is all the more disturb when you learn that it is be led by the nlrb act gener counsel __PUNCT__ who ha not yet receiv confirm from the senat __PUNCT__ and is onli on the board becaus of a recess appoint from presid obama __PUNCT__
the presid also recent us a recess appoint to get craig becker on the board __PUNCT__
becker is so radic anti __PUNCT__ busi he could not even get approv by a democrat senat __PUNCT__
becker ha previous written that the feder govern should be abl to control where compani choos to direct their capit and resourc to give union an advantag in labor negoti __PUNCT__
obvious thi bear directli on thi case with boe __PUNCT__
it is clear that presid obama is stack the deck against south carolina and other right to work state at the behest of hi union alli __PUNCT__
your senat __PUNCT__ lindsei graham __PUNCT__ wa exactli right when he character the nlrb complaint as __PUNCT__ on of the worst exampl of unelect bureaucrat do the bid of special interest group that i ever seen __PUNCT__
thi complaint is an explicit and devast exampl of the obama administr reckless and danger us of the power of big govern to reward it polit backer __PUNCT__
it is a textbook case of the corrupt power of big govern that the found father warn against that erod the rule of law __PUNCT__
but in a larger sens __PUNCT__ the obama administr action against boe is even more audaci than the corrupt of our polit institut by big govern __PUNCT__
we know from the __NUM__ censu that the south led the nation for the first time in term of popul growth __PUNCT__ ad __NUM__ million peopl __PUNCT__
peopl ar vote with their feet for better econom opportun __PUNCT__
and a larg part of the reason for the better econom opportun in the south is the right for worker not to be forc into a union if you don't want to be __PUNCT__
it is the right to work __PUNCT__
and on of the most underreport stori of the larg migrat to the south ha been the larg number of african __PUNCT__ american move to the south in search of econom opportun and a better qualiti of life __PUNCT__
the south is win the futur __PUNCT__
the right to work state ar win the futur __PUNCT__
thei have pursu the right polici and thei ar lead to the right result __PUNCT__
there is no greater proof that these state ar win the futur for their citizen than the willing of million of american to move to these state in search of a better futur for themselv and their children __PUNCT__
boe move to set up oper in south carolina follow the same logic of move to more promis opportun __PUNCT__
and what the obama administr is sai in respons is that thei ar go to block econom progress and sai no __PUNCT__ while million of american and thousand of compani ar sai ye to a better life __PUNCT__
there is no clearer exampl of thi administr will disdain for the consent of the govern __PUNCT__
the republican hous should cut off all fund for the nlrb until presid obama withdraw the nomin of lafe soloman and craig becker __PUNCT__ and appoint replac who pledg to uphold the rule of law instead of the rule of big labor __PUNCT__
the return to prosper and the reestablish of the proper constitut balanc between govern and the govern will not be an easi task __PUNCT__
but protect our freedom ha never been easi __PUNCT__
the elect of __NUM__ is the most import elect of our lifetim __PUNCT__
down the left hand road li a washington bureaucraci run our live in a corrupt system defin by politician __PUNCT__
down our road li the rebirth of freedom __PUNCT__ the reassert of the constitut and the renew of the american economi __PUNCT__
i am run for presid to chang washington decis __PUNCT__ reinforc obedi to the constitut and reestablish the core principl of the declar of independ __PUNCT__
thi campaign will requir a team effort __PUNCT__ with everi american who believ as i do that the futur of american liberti requir a recommit to the timeless principl of our countri found __PUNCT__ that everi man __PUNCT__ woman __PUNCT__ and child is endow by our creator with certain unalien right __PUNCT__
that among these right ar the right to life __PUNCT__ liberti and the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__
and that govern deriv it onli just author from the consent of the govern __PUNCT__ from we the peopl __PUNCT__
and sinc we truli believ that everi american is endow by our creator with certain unalien right __PUNCT__ then we must be determin to go into our countri poorest commun __PUNCT__ whether it is in the vallei __PUNCT__ the inner citi __PUNCT__ or poor __PUNCT__ rural area __PUNCT__
we must chang the cultur __PUNCT__ we must chang the bureaucraci __PUNCT__ we must chang the tax code __PUNCT__ we must chang the law __PUNCT__ we must do whatev it take to ensur that everi american is truli capabl of pursu happi __PUNCT__ as thei have been endow by their creator with that right __PUNCT__
and when we show that we ar truli seriou about all american citizen have the right to pursu happi __PUNCT__ we will creat such an overwhelm major __PUNCT__ we will be abl to offer our children and grandchildren a vastli better futur than the bureaucrat welfar state of depend __PUNCT__ coercion __PUNCT__ and ineffect we face todai __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
