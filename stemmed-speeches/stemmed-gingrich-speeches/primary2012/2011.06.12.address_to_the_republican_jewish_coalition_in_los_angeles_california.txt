earlier thi week __PUNCT__ jewish peopl all over the world celebr the feast of shavuot __PUNCT__ or pentecost __PUNCT__ commemor the revel of the ten command on mount sinai __PUNCT__
and todai is actual pentecost sundai in the christian tradit __PUNCT__
it wa on thi feast of shavuot __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ of __NUM__ a mere six dai after the old citi of jerusalem had been reunit in the six dai war __PUNCT__ that for the first time in almost __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ jewish peopl were onc again abl to visit the western wall and walk the street of the old citi as citizen of a sovereign jewish nation __PUNCT__
hour befor dawn that dai __PUNCT__ thousand upon thousand of jew gather at the zion gate to await entri into the old citi __PUNCT__
at __NUM__ a.m __PUNCT__ the crowd were final allow to stream into east jerusalem __PUNCT__ the first time jew had been allow to carri out a pilgrimag to the western wall __PUNCT__ as member of a jewish nation __PUNCT__ celebr a jewish festiv __PUNCT__ sinc the pilgrimag to the templ __NUM__ year earlier __PUNCT__
as the sun rose over the old citi __PUNCT__ a total of more than __NUM__ jew made their wai through the citi street to a site that todai remain the heart of a peopl __PUNCT__ a religion __PUNCT__ and a nation __PUNCT__
each year the festiv is celebr in a similar fashion __PUNCT__ by a pedestrian pilgrimag through the street of jerusalem to the western wall __PUNCT__
it is a pilgrimag of which gener of jew could onli dream __PUNCT__ and signifi the unbroken connect between the ident of the jewish peopl and the land of israel that ha exist not for mere decad __PUNCT__ but for thousand of year __PUNCT__
dure thi last week __PUNCT__ todai gener of jew made a similar pilgrimag through the street of jerusalem __PUNCT__ know that the freedom that allow them to visit their holiest site is more endang at thi moment in histori than at ani time sinc that shavuot morn four and a half decad ago __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ both israel and america ar at a danger crossroad in which the surviv of israel and the safeti of the unit state both hang in the balanc __PUNCT__
while the unit state and her alli have won import victori in the war on terror __PUNCT__ it is imposs to look at the total of the world ten year after 9/11 and conclud that we ar on the win path __PUNCT__ or that the world is a safer place __PUNCT__
year after year the forc of terror becom stronger and the claim of terrorist becom more accept to our european alli and more power in the unit nation __PUNCT__
year after year the iranian dictatorship __PUNCT__ with it openli state desir to annihil israel and defeat the unit state move closer to have nuclear mean to do so __PUNCT__
year after year hama grow stronger in gaza and hezbollah grow stronger in lebanon __PUNCT__
todai the greatest obstacl toward achiev a real and last peac is not the strength of the enemi or the unwilling of israel to make great sacrific for the sake of peac __PUNCT__ but an inabl on the part of the obama administr and certain other world leader to tell the truth about terror __PUNCT__ be honest about the publicli state goal of our common enemi __PUNCT__ and devis polici appropri to an honest account of realiti __PUNCT__
recal that dure congression testimoni last year __PUNCT__ attornei gener holder wa repeatedli ask and yet could not bring himself to sai that the ideolog of radic islam plai a role in motiv islam terrorist to carri out their attack __PUNCT__
the report issu in the aftermath of the fort hood attack __PUNCT__ in which major nidal hassan __PUNCT__ who carri around busi card that said __PUNCT__ warrior of allah __PUNCT__ and shout allahu akbar while open fire on unarm men and women __PUNCT__ did not onc mention radic islam __PUNCT__
in an eerili similar incid at the frankfurt airport earlier thi year __PUNCT__ a terrorist open fire __PUNCT__ yell allahu akbar and kill two peopl __PUNCT__
yet the state depart spokesman __PUNCT__ when ask if it wa a terrorist attack __PUNCT__ respond by ask __PUNCT__ wa the shoot of congresswoman gabriel gifford a terrorist attack __PUNCT__ thi moral confus __PUNCT__ which cannot see the differ between the isol __PUNCT__ albeit deprav __PUNCT__ action of a madman __PUNCT__ and an attack that fit into an carefulli defin ideolog of radic islamist terror __PUNCT__ is sadli typic of thi administr elev of polit correct abov common sens __PUNCT__
the obama administr polici toward israel ha been a victim of thi same danger confus __PUNCT__
in hi recent state depart speech __PUNCT__ presid obama rightli state that israel cannot be expect to negoti with a terrorist organ that deni it right to exist __PUNCT__
but he then went on in the same speech to pressur israel to do exactli that __PUNCT__
presid obama want israel to enter into negoti with a palestinian author that is now in leagu with the terrorist organ hama __PUNCT__
the presid said that appli thi pressur on israel wa not the polit savvi thing for him to do __PUNCT__ and that the safe thing to do in an elect year is noth __PUNCT__
he is essenti tell us that he is do the brave thing by pressur israel to negoti with terrorist who want to destroi it __PUNCT__
presid obama and hi state depart should recal some basic fact __PUNCT__
hama wa found as a terrorist organ dedic to the destruct of israel __PUNCT__
it charter openli call for israel destruct and instruct it follow to kill jew wherev thei find them __PUNCT__
also consid these recent statement __PUNCT__ ismail haniyeh __PUNCT__ head of the hama administr in the gaza strip comment on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ the jew ar the most despic and contempt nation to crawl upon the face of the earth __PUNCT__
two dai later hama foreign liaison chief osama hamdan said in an interview that quot __PUNCT__ i think that we ar enter the phase of the liber of palestin __PUNCT__
when we talk about the liber of palestin __PUNCT__ we ar talk about the notion of return __PUNCT__ the return of the refuge to their homeland __PUNCT__ and the return of the isra to the countri from which thei came __PUNCT__
then on __DATE__ hama mp and cleric yuni al __PUNCT__ astal said quot __PUNCT__ in just a few year __PUNCT__ all the zionist and the settler will realiz that their arriv in palestin wa for the purpos of the great massacr __PUNCT__ by mean of which allah want to reliev human of their evil __PUNCT__ that wa just on month ago __PUNCT__
hama goe well beyond word in it effort to destroi israel __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ over __NUM__ missil were fire into israel from gaza __PUNCT__
no countri can be expect to conduct peac negoti with a terrorist organ dedic to it destruct __PUNCT__ or with a palestinian government author that join forc with such a terrorist organ __PUNCT__
becaus hama ha not chang __PUNCT__ an isra peac with hama is imposs __PUNCT__
twenti year of hope for the modern peac process cannot chang thi fundament realiti __PUNCT__
it also mean that enter into peac negoti with ani organ that includ hama is a fool errand __PUNCT__
it is someth that no friend of israel should ever ask israel to do __PUNCT__
and let me add __PUNCT__ i certainli hope thi administr doesn't resort to the meaningless exercis of try to artifici distinguish between the militari and polit wing of hama as a wai of justifi pressur on israel to negoti with the latter __PUNCT__
we understand full well that monei is fungibl __PUNCT__ but ideolog is constant __PUNCT__
hama remain unequivoc in it aim to destroi israel __PUNCT__ and it itself make no such distinct __PUNCT__ an approach that plai a danger game with the surviv of israel __PUNCT__
in hi recent speech __PUNCT__ presid obama also call for israel to accept the __NUM__ line as the begin of peac negoti __PUNCT__
he went to great length to have us all believ that what he said at the state depart and later at aipac wa no differ than what other american presid have declar as offici polici __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ that just not true __PUNCT__
presid obama ha in fact call for a remark shift in u. __PUNCT__ polici regard the peac process __PUNCT__
he want israel to accept the indefens line of __NUM__ as the start point of negoti __PUNCT__
accept such a propos would be a suicid step for israel __PUNCT__
fortun for israel __PUNCT__ the presid plan for israel to accept the __NUM__ line is an absolut non __PUNCT__ starter with the american peopl __PUNCT__
like israel __PUNCT__ we ar commit to see a peac agreement that protect jerusalem as the undivid capit of the jewish state __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ it ha onli been under jewish author that religi freedom __PUNCT__ includ access to holi site __PUNCT__ for peopl of all faith __PUNCT__ christian __PUNCT__ jewish __PUNCT__ and muslim __PUNCT__ ha been protect __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ we must readili see the presid polici for what thei ar __PUNCT__ the danger accommod of middl east dictat __PUNCT__ and wors __PUNCT__ the accommod of terrorist group like hama __PUNCT__ whose ideolog virul oppos freedom __PUNCT__ compromis __PUNCT__ and peac __PUNCT__ and who view such accommod as a weaken of u. __PUNCT__ resolv and commit to israel secur __PUNCT__
presid obama polici repres a sharp break from the post world war ii american polit consensu of provid unwav support to the state of israel __PUNCT__ all at the risk of israel destruct and increas danger to the unit state __PUNCT__
the decis to adopt a polici of accommod __PUNCT__ us the polit object and code __PUNCT__ word of those who wish to drive israel into the sea __PUNCT__ affirm the administr radic in it headlong flight from the legaci of u. __PUNCT__ presid from truman to bush __PUNCT__ and is lead israel and the western democraci toward ever increas danger __PUNCT__
nowher will thi danger be shown more clearli thi come __DATE__ at the unit nation gener assembl __PUNCT__
the palestinian have said that thei will request u.n __PUNCT__ recognit of palestinian statehood base upon the __NUM__ border __PUNCT__
thi action would violat everi stand agreement the palestinian have with israel __PUNCT__ includ the oslo accord __PUNCT__ to negoti a final border agreement __PUNCT__
such a recognit would take place total apart from ani negoti with israel __PUNCT__ and without the palestinian renounc violenc or acknowledg israel statehood __PUNCT__
while presid obama rightli sai that the unit state will vote against thi unilater action __PUNCT__ some nation __PUNCT__ includ even some in europ __PUNCT__ ar send the signal that thei mai inde vote for it __PUNCT__
a vote by civil nation in the gener assembl to unilater recogn a palestinian state would strengthen terrorist __PUNCT__ belief that their commit to violenc and their unwav reject of israel right to exist ha begun to produc their desir goal __PUNCT__
presid obama and the state depart must be clear in their discuss with our western alli __PUNCT__ to rememb the mistak of histori and to reject thi unilater action that would reward terrorist group who refus to abid by the basic principl of human digniti and freedom __PUNCT__
stephen harper __PUNCT__ prime minist of canada __PUNCT__ had it right when he said __PUNCT__ when israel __PUNCT__ the onli countri in the world whose veri exist is under attack __PUNCT__ is consist and conspicu singl out for condemn __PUNCT__ i believ we ar moral oblig to take a stand __PUNCT__
presid obama focu on israel as the obstacl to peac is particularli disturb consid the exist of a true threat to the peac of the world __PUNCT__ and that is the threat from iran __PUNCT__
the iranian dictatorship is steadili and method develop nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
all the world diplomat meet and four round of u.n __PUNCT__ sanction have not slow the iranian dictatorship down a singl dai __PUNCT__
the iranian leader __PUNCT__ mahmoud ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ ha been veri open and explicit about hi desir to wipe israel off the map __PUNCT__
when you realiz that onli three iranian nuclear weapon deploi against israel would bring about the equival of a second holocaust __PUNCT__ you have to take hi word serious __PUNCT__
ahmadinejad is also threaten the unit state __PUNCT__
he ha call for a __PUNCT__ world without america __PUNCT__
a goal he said is attain __PUNCT__
the iranian threat is hardli new __PUNCT__
mark bowden in hi book __PUNCT__ guest of the ayatollah __PUNCT__ describ the __NUM__ seizur of the u. __PUNCT__ embassi and hostag take as the first shot in iran war against america __PUNCT__
for decad __PUNCT__ america and israel have share a common enemi embodi in thi poison ideolog that threaten our safeti __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ and peac __PUNCT__
it is the same ideolog that murder isra athlet in __NUM__ that took american hostag in iran for __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ that murder marin in their barrack in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ that bomb the world trade center in __NUM__ riyadh in __NUM__ the khobar tower in __NUM__ the u. __PUNCT__ embassi in __NUM__ and the uss cole in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
mani of the terrorist group that have carri out these and mani other attack have been support directli by the nation of iran __PUNCT__
todai iran is watch whether the unit state keep it promis with it alli israel and how we deal with iran proxi __PUNCT__ hama and hezbollah __PUNCT__
the iranian regim will also be watch how america and our alli treat israel at the u.n __PUNCT__ gener assembl thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__
just earlier thi week __PUNCT__ iran nuclear chief announc their intent to tripl their product of highli enrich uranium and to continu to instal more advanc centrifug for that purpos __PUNCT__
iran ha also experi with polonium and nuclear trigger __PUNCT__ which have onli on purpos __PUNCT__ to deton a nuclear bomb __PUNCT__
what then should america do in the face of these fact __PUNCT__ we first need to acknowledg that __NUM__ year of try to negoti peac with evil regim and organ dedic to the destruct of israel __PUNCT__ and in mani case our own destruct __PUNCT__ ha been a failur __PUNCT__ and the time ha come to clearli and decis take the offens against them __PUNCT__
thi begin with a firm and consist commit by the unit state __PUNCT__ in the reagan tradit __PUNCT__ to speak plainli and truthfulli about the natur of our enemi __PUNCT__
next __PUNCT__ our polici must reflect the fact that there is no moral equival between terrorist regim and a legitim self __PUNCT__ govern countri that abid by the rule of law __PUNCT__
a foreign polici base upon thi moral distinct is increasingli critic dure a moment mani have term the __PUNCT__ arab spring __PUNCT__
the upris in egypt __PUNCT__ tunisia __PUNCT__ and libya ar evid of the fact that there ar inde million of peac __PUNCT__ love arab who resent the brutal oppress of their leader __PUNCT__ dictatorship and long for a futur of freedom and peac __PUNCT__
these upris ar tremend opportun for the advanc of freedom and democraci in the middl east __PUNCT__
at the same time these develop ar fraught with danger __PUNCT__ and bring with them the possibl that radic islamist faction will capit on the upheav and take control __PUNCT__
our commit to condemn and confront terror in the world must be match by an equal commit to affirm the effort of oppress arab citizen who ar take extraordinari risk to seek true peac __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ and democraci __PUNCT__
both in the case of the iranian and syrian popular upris __PUNCT__ the obama administr glare silenc ha undermin the strength of our commit to freedom and solidar with those peopl who ar yearn to breath free __PUNCT__
and everi terrorist group in the world take note of that silenc __PUNCT__ whether hama __PUNCT__ hezbollah __PUNCT__ or terrorist regim like iran __PUNCT__
there ar nine specif polici propos i would like to leav with you tonight __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
as a demonstr of thi new resolv __PUNCT__ the unit state should move the american embassi in israel to jerusalem __PUNCT__
israel ha everi right as a sovereign free nation to choos it own capitol and we should respect that choic __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ on my first dai in offic __PUNCT__ i would issu an execut order direct the u. __PUNCT__ embassi in israel to be move to jerusalem as provid for in the legisl i introduc in congress in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
the unit state must also refus to particip in ani talk involv terrorist organ and cut off all direct and indirect aid to terrorist and their front group __PUNCT__
thi must includ the palestinian author __PUNCT__ so long as it includ hama and continu to produc propaganda lioniz suicid bomber and promot the destruct of israel __PUNCT__
we should also call on other nation who ar ostens commit to true peac between israel and the palestinian to do the same __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
the unit state should also explicitli reject the concept of a __PUNCT__ right of return __PUNCT__ for palestinian refuge __PUNCT__
the so __PUNCT__ call right of return is a histor imposs demand that would be a demograph disast and mean the end of a jewish state of israel __PUNCT__
we ar for a right to prosper __PUNCT__ a right to freedom __PUNCT__ a right to the rule of law __PUNCT__ and a right to privat properti __PUNCT__
we must be total oppos to a right of return __PUNCT__
thi mean that the palestinian refuge problem must be resolv outsid the border of israel by the palestinian govern after palestinian statehood ha been achiev __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
the unit nation camp system must be replac with a system of earn incom and properti right to restor digniti and hope to everi palestinian __PUNCT__
the current __PUNCT__ fail camp system of social and unearn chariti ha been a disast __PUNCT__
it ha led to poverti __PUNCT__ vast unemploy __PUNCT__ deep bitter and a societi which produc entrepreneur of terror rather than entrepreneur of wealth creation __PUNCT__
more monei in the form of intern aid will not solv thi problem __PUNCT__
a new approach will bring a better standard of live and greater freedom and secur for palestinian than all the terrorist effort and dictatorship have been abl to achiev __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
we must also re __PUNCT__ establish the unit state inform agenc as a robustli fund worldwid anti __PUNCT__ terror and pro __PUNCT__ freedom commun and advocaci system __PUNCT__
the usia fought for our side in the war of idea dure the cold war and help us win __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ thi agenc wa dismantl becaus we thought the war of idea wa over __PUNCT__
we discov on 9/11 that it wa not __PUNCT__
israel is remind of thi on almost a daili basi __PUNCT__
earlier thi year __PUNCT__ terrorist of the al aqsa martyr brigad broke into the west bank home of udi and ruth fogel in itamar __PUNCT__
the terrorist stab thi husband and wife to death __PUNCT__
thei murder three of their children __PUNCT__
not even the youngest of these children __PUNCT__ a three __PUNCT__ month __PUNCT__ old babi girl name hada __PUNCT__ wa spare __PUNCT__
thei slit the child throat __PUNCT__ and sever her head from her bodi __PUNCT__
in gaza __PUNCT__ crowd hand out candi and celebr __PUNCT__
thi sicken displai of jubil at the gruesom murder of a three __PUNCT__ month __PUNCT__ old child is the result of decad upon decad of brainwash palestinian children __PUNCT__
it is an exampl of the kind of barbar act of terror that must be reject by all palestinian in ani peac negoti with israel __PUNCT__
the usia help america win the cold war and it can help us win the war against evil terrorist organ and dictatorship __PUNCT__
but to do thi we must ensur that the usia onc again ha independ board of governor report to the presid and coordin with the state depart but not control by the diplomat __PUNCT__
never again should a three __PUNCT__ month __PUNCT__ old babi be kill without the entir world be repuls and join togeth in condemn such terrorist and their support __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
we must aggress confront the grow threat of a nuclear __PUNCT__ arm iran __PUNCT__
the exist of the iranian regim pursu nuclear weapon and financ terror across the globe is a primari threat to the secur of the unit state __PUNCT__ israel and our alli in the world __PUNCT__
the unit state must lead the world in an all __PUNCT__ out effort to replac the iranian dictatorship us the diplomat __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ inform __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ and covert tool presid reagan us to defeat and dismantl the soviet empir __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
the unit state must also establish an aggress new strategi of take back the unit nation from the forc of terror and dictatorship __PUNCT__
total discredit and __PUNCT__ if possibl __PUNCT__ stop the durban __NUM__ confer on racism later thi year __PUNCT__ the previou two session of which have been us as a vehicl for anti __PUNCT__ semit __PUNCT__ should be an earli goal of thi new worldwid campaign __PUNCT__
furthermor __PUNCT__ the unit state must be prepar to suspend all fund to the unit nation if the gener assembl move to recogn a palestinian state under the control of hama __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
all of thi will requir a restructur state depart __PUNCT__ a new level of train and manag for ambassador __PUNCT__ a new promot system __PUNCT__ and a profound shift in the cultur of the foreign servic __PUNCT__
the quickest wai to chang the cultur at the state depart is to inject new blood into the system __PUNCT__
we must engag in fundament reform of the overli slow and bureaucrat secur clearanc system to rais the level of applic to the foreign servic __PUNCT__
chang on thi scale will be bitterli fought by the old guard at state and their media alli __PUNCT__
it will requir a strong __PUNCT__ experienc __PUNCT__ and knowledg secretari of state and a deepli commit team around him __PUNCT__
my campaign websit __URL__ contain a detail document outlin the other chang that will be necessari to transform the state depart histor avers to moral clariti about the differ between terror and civil __PUNCT__ which have weaken both the unit state and israel __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ the unit state must establish an american energi polici design to strengthen our nation economi and weaken our oppon in the middl east by keep in the unit state the hundr of billion of dollar we now spend on foreign oil suppli __PUNCT__
we must dramat increas american energi suppli so we can lower the margin cost of energi worldwid __PUNCT__
noth will do more to alter the strateg balanc of power awai from dictatorship and state sponsor of terror than a success american energi polici __PUNCT__
in close __PUNCT__ if it were possibl to sai a word directli to the isra peopl __PUNCT__ it would be thi __PUNCT__ we believ togeth with you that peac is possibl __PUNCT__ and that peac ultim will come to israel __PUNCT__
the never __PUNCT__ end tendenc to blame israel first is just anoth variat of blame america first __PUNCT__ and it spring from the same weak __PUNCT__
it is far easier to ignor an unpleas realiti and try instead to impos your will on somebodi you think you can control __PUNCT__ rather than deal with the unpleas realiti that you ar too timid to confront __PUNCT__
if israel disarm todai __PUNCT__ there would be no israel tomorrow __PUNCT__
but if iran __PUNCT__ hama __PUNCT__ hezbollah and other terrorist group disarm todai __PUNCT__ then tomorrow we would have peac in the middl east __PUNCT__
while our challeng todai will like not meet with such a simpl solut __PUNCT__ our commit to israel protect remain as staunch as it ha been from the moment of israel birth __PUNCT__
and i would also sai thi to the brave peopl of israel __PUNCT__ never __PUNCT__ ever underestim the hold that israel ha on the american heart __PUNCT__
the american peopl have alwai believ in israel __PUNCT__ and we believ in israel still __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we will renew our mutual commit to freedom and justic __PUNCT__ and we will work to achiev a peac in which war and bloodsh and violenc ar no longer a common featur of life for you and your children __PUNCT__
on __DATE__ when abyssinia wa be invad by itali __PUNCT__ empor hail selassi appeal to the leagu of nation assembl for assist __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ it is us todai __PUNCT__
it will be you tomorrow __PUNCT__
we know that if the forc of terror could elimin israel todai __PUNCT__ thei would turn toward america tomorrow __PUNCT__
that is why we must revers the obama administr danger polici of incoher and accommod and implement instead a foreign polici that is clear about the evil that we face and commit to the action necessari to overcom it __PUNCT__
america is still the last best hope of mankind on earth __PUNCT__
i believ like ronald reagan did that the goal of u. __PUNCT__ foreign polici must be the promot of peac __PUNCT__
but that it must be a real peac where freedom can flourish and justic can prevail __PUNCT__ not a fals peac that embolden terrorist __PUNCT__ tyrant and murder ideolog to extend their evil throughout the world __PUNCT__
it is toward thi possibl of real peac that america must commit itself __PUNCT__
no other nation in the histori of the world ha been so inexor ti to the fate of freedom throughout the world __PUNCT__
the time ha come to reaffirm america commit to freedom and the rule of law __PUNCT__ to stand firmli and courag against terror and evil organ and dictatorship __PUNCT__
it is time to stand firmli with our friend __PUNCT__
togeth those of us who believ in freedom will defeat tyranni for the fourth time in a centuri __PUNCT__
togeth we will earn for our children and grandchildren a freer and safer world __PUNCT__
thi is our duti __PUNCT__
thi is our gener rendezv with destini __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
