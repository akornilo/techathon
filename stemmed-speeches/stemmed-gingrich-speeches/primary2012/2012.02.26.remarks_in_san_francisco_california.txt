__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ i am not a newcom to the energi issu __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ we launch __PUNCT__ drill here __PUNCT__ drill now __PUNCT__ pai less __PUNCT__
with sean hanniti help __PUNCT__ we got __NUM__ signer __PUNCT__
the hous republican pick up the theme __PUNCT__
ultim __PUNCT__ governor palin pick up the theme __PUNCT__
the fact that is that prior to the collaps of wall street __PUNCT__ john mccain wa ahead by three and republican and the hous were ahead by five becaus the left had no answer on the issu of energi __PUNCT__
we wrote a book call __PUNCT__ drill here __PUNCT__ drill now __PUNCT__ pai less __PUNCT__
and callista and i madea documentari call __PUNCT__ we have the power __PUNCT__
and the purpos wa realli simpl __PUNCT__ we have the power __PUNCT__
we have more than enough energi in unit state that we do not have to reli on foreign countri __PUNCT__
but we have an anti __PUNCT__ american energi govern __PUNCT__ and anti __PUNCT__ american energi bureaucraci __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ american energi regul and now __PUNCT__ we have a presid who ha decid to engag us on thi issu __PUNCT__
after i came out for a program to get to __MONEY__ a gallon gasolin __PUNCT__ obama decid he had to make a speech on energi __PUNCT__
i realli hope everi american will read hi speech in miami __PUNCT__
it is a veri reveal speech __PUNCT__
it is factual fals __PUNCT__ intellectu incoher __PUNCT__ deepli conflict on polici __PUNCT__ and in some place just strang __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laugh __PUNCT__ but imagin the challeng for obama __PUNCT__
obama is a genuin left __PUNCT__ winger __PUNCT__
that is hi world __PUNCT__
he believ in the stuff __PUNCT__
and realli what is danger about him is not what he doesn't know __PUNCT__ it is what he know that isn't true __PUNCT__
he believ in small car __PUNCT__
he believ in an anti __PUNCT__ american energi polici __PUNCT__
he believ in high price __PUNCT__
he believ in govern control __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ hi challeng is he is run for reelect __PUNCT__
the american peopl actual want the car and truck that thei like __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar pro __PUNCT__ american energi by about __NUM__ to the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the american peopl like low price __PUNCT__
the american peopl believ individu citizen should decid what car thei want to bui __PUNCT__
so obama make thi energi speech __PUNCT__ but you have to see it in it context __PUNCT__
and i think thi is what is make it so hopeless for him to go around and pretend that he is for american energi __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ as a senat __PUNCT__ obama wa the onli sponsor of a bill which would have elimin an inventori of offshor oil asset __PUNCT__
i want you to think about thi __PUNCT__
thi is part of the left great problem todai __PUNCT__
thei realli believ in __PUNCT__ peak energi __PUNCT__
thei realli believ that you know we go to run out __PUNCT__
we have to ration __PUNCT__
the govern ha to be in charg __PUNCT__
jimmi carter wa right __PUNCT__
we ought to have gasolin ration __PUNCT__
we ought to do someth in some wai to make sure we don't us thi all up __PUNCT__
and their problem is that it wrong __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ their fear is if thei actual show us how much energi we have __PUNCT__ we will actual want the energi __PUNCT__
so thei want us to not see the energi becaus then we can't ask for it becaus we don't have it __PUNCT__
and so he liter introduc a bill that wa a bill that favor ignor __PUNCT__
and it is fascin becaus what north dakota ha done is that it ha blown apart their worldview __PUNCT__
in north dakota in the bakken format todai ha __NUM__ time as much oil __PUNCT__
that is __NUM__ percent more oil than thei thought __PUNCT__
the bakken format is now at __NUM__ percent unemploy in north dakota and that overst the case becaus thei have __NUM__ unfil job in oil field __PUNCT__
the peopl who ar unemploi don't have the skill to do the job __PUNCT__
the peopl who have the skill __PUNCT__ thei basic have zero unemploy __PUNCT__
and thei gener so much revenu for the state govern that thei have had seven straight tax cut and thei have a multibillion __PUNCT__ dollar raini dai fund __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ all of thi just drive the left crazi __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ there is on reason thi wa develop __PUNCT__
it wa on privat land and the obama administr couldn't stop it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ let me let you understand the framework in which these folk think __PUNCT__
even in north dakota __PUNCT__ and i believ by the wai the judiciari committe should look in to thi __PUNCT__ should subpoena document and should hold hear __PUNCT__
even though it wa on privat land __PUNCT__ thei still decid to harass the oil industri __PUNCT__
so the u. __PUNCT__ attornei __PUNCT__ obama u. __PUNCT__ attornei from north dakota file a lawsuit against the oil compani base on eight migratori bird __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ wind kill about __NUM__ bird a year __PUNCT__
so wind turbin __PUNCT__ thei ar substanti more danger for bird __PUNCT__
but wind is green __PUNCT__ so it is good __PUNCT__ so therefor __PUNCT__ it realli didn't kill the bird becaus if it kill the bird __PUNCT__ it be bad __PUNCT__ but it can't be bad becaus it is good __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laugh __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ thei manag to find eight bird __PUNCT__ and thei file a lawsuit __PUNCT__
the judg threw it out __PUNCT__
it is an egregi abus of prosecutori power __PUNCT__ and i think the hous judiciari committe should __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ find out the decis document in north dakota and then find out if the decis document of the justic depart that allow such an egregi abus of power __PUNCT__
so thei realli hate the idea that thi is all work __PUNCT__
but now __PUNCT__ rememb thi is a long histori __PUNCT__
i go to read sever thing __PUNCT__ those of you that know me well __PUNCT__ know i usual just speak off the cuff but and i want to share stuff with you that i think is realli import __PUNCT__
here in san francisco __PUNCT__ __DATE__ dure campaign __PUNCT__ see an exampl about the attitud about the price of energi __PUNCT__
quot __PUNCT__ quot barack obama __PUNCT__ talk to the san francisco chronicl editori board __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ under my plan of cap and trade __PUNCT__ electr price will necessarili skyrocket and power plant __PUNCT__ natur ga __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__ whenev the plant were __PUNCT__ whatev the plant were __PUNCT__ whatev the industri wa __PUNCT__ thei would have to retro __PUNCT__ fit their oper and that will cost monei and thei will pass that monei on to the consum __PUNCT__
so if someon want to build a coal fire power plant __PUNCT__ it just that it will bankrupt them becaus thei ar not go to be charg the huge amount for all that greenhous ga that is be lift __PUNCT__
so it is realli open __PUNCT__
higher price ar good __PUNCT__
thei ar necessari __PUNCT__
compani will be bankrupt __PUNCT__
thi is the true left __PUNCT__
thei also come up with silli solut __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i am go to get to alga later on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laugh __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ i am pro __PUNCT__ research into alga __PUNCT__
i am a veri big pro __PUNCT__ scienc gui __PUNCT__
i knew a gui in texa a&m who is work on alga __PUNCT__
and i think somedai down the road alga mai well be a us asset __PUNCT__ but it is a littl bit like solyndra __PUNCT__
the presid keep find these thing __PUNCT__ which would work somedai if onli thei work __PUNCT__ but thei don't work __PUNCT__ but thei should work if onli thei work __PUNCT__
you realli feel much better about them work __PUNCT__
he doesn't want the thing that do work becaus those thing make you feel bad so we can't have the thing that do work becaus he want to do the thing that don't work __PUNCT__

but here __PUNCT__ and i first got onto thi when obama went to campaign for the democrat candid for the senat __PUNCT__ teddi kennedi seat in the special elect __PUNCT__
and he did thi entir riff on scott brown truck __PUNCT__
scott brown wa campaign around the state in a pickup truck __PUNCT__
and you could tell __PUNCT__ you go back and read the speech that obama gave in boston just befor the elect __PUNCT__
you can tell he wa fixat on thi pickup truck and how inappropri it wa to have a pickup __PUNCT__
