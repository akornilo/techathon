and i want to thank linda upmey is the major leader in the hous __PUNCT__ and greg gansk __PUNCT__ my former colleagu in the congress __PUNCT__ who realli all summer held thi togeth __PUNCT__ when realli it could have fallen apart __PUNCT__
i want to thank everybodi who work all fall __PUNCT__ particularli dure the avalanch of neg ad __PUNCT__
calista and i want to thank the peopl of iowa __PUNCT__
all through be drown in neg __PUNCT__ everywher we went __PUNCT__ peopl were posit __PUNCT__ thei were recept __PUNCT__ thei were will to ask question __PUNCT__ and thei would listen __PUNCT__
and thei realli want to get to the truth rather than the latest __NUM__ __PUNCT__ second distort __PUNCT__
and it realli gave us a feel that thi process doe work __PUNCT__
i am delight to be here tonight __PUNCT__ and i think that we ar at the begin of an extraordinarili import campaign __PUNCT__
the ultim goal of thi campaign ha to be to replac barack obama and get america back on the right track __PUNCT__
but let be clear __PUNCT__ on of the thing that becam obviou in the last few week in iowa is that there will be a great debat in the republican parti befor we ar prepar to have a great debat with barack obama __PUNCT__
and i think it veri import to understand that __PUNCT__
and i want to take just a minut and congratul a good friend of our __PUNCT__ somebodi who we admir and whose famili we admir __PUNCT__ and that rick santorum __PUNCT__
he wage a great __PUNCT__ posit campaign __PUNCT__
i serv with rick __PUNCT__
we had a great relationship over the year __PUNCT__ and i admir the courag __PUNCT__ the disciplin __PUNCT__ the wai he focus __PUNCT__
and i also admir how posit he wa __PUNCT__
i wish i could sai that for all the candid __PUNCT__
but here the kei thing to ask __PUNCT__
it not just about beat obama __PUNCT__ as import as that is __PUNCT__
it about what do we need to do as a countri to get back on the right track __PUNCT__
and that a lot bigger than just replac on person in the white hous __PUNCT__
that fix the congress __PUNCT__ fix the bureaucraci __PUNCT__ fix the court __PUNCT__ reset the cultur __PUNCT__ get the judg to understand that thei oper within the constitut __PUNCT__ not abov it __PUNCT__
there ar tremend step we have to take __PUNCT__
and we have to re __PUNCT__ establish the work ethic and recogn we want to reward work __PUNCT__ not redistribut __PUNCT__ that we want to reward paycheck __PUNCT__ not food stamp __PUNCT__
and thi is go to be a veri import nation convers __PUNCT__
but it not just about here at home __PUNCT__
we also have to understand __PUNCT__ and thi will be a major debat with congressman paul __PUNCT__ who had a veri good night __PUNCT__ and i congratul him on have done veri well __PUNCT__
but the fact is __PUNCT__ hi view on foreign polici __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ar stunningli danger for the surviv of the unit state __PUNCT__
and i think it a veri simpl question __PUNCT__ which i would be glad at the next debat to ask congressman paul __PUNCT__
if you have a terrorist who is prepar to put on a bomb and wear it as a vest and walk into a groceri store or a mall or a bu and blow themselv up __PUNCT__ as long as thei can kill you __PUNCT__ why would you think that if thei could get access to a nuclear weapon thei wouldn't us it __PUNCT__ an iranian nuclear weapon is on of the most frighten thing we have to confront for the futur of everi young person up here and everi young person out there __PUNCT__
if thei ar go to live in safeti __PUNCT__ thei have to live in a world in which there is no iranian nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ on that front we have a veri import debat __PUNCT__
is the world danger and do we need to be strong enough to protect ourselv or is the world realli safe and is it just the american who ar confus __PUNCT__ i have no doubt about 9/11 __PUNCT__
it wa bad peopl try to kill us __PUNCT__
it wasn't american __PUNCT__
i have no doubt about the iranian __PUNCT__ and i have no doubt about the import of the surviv of israel as a moral caus __PUNCT__ which we have to recogn as central to our futur __PUNCT__
so we have a great debat with congressman paul __PUNCT__
and it import for set a new stabl foreign polici for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
we have on other great debat __PUNCT__
and that is whether thi parti want a reagan conserv who help chang washington in the 1980 with ronald reagan and help chang washington in the 1990 as speaker of the hous __PUNCT__
somebodi who is into chang washington __PUNCT__ or do we want a massachusett moder who __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ will be pretti good at manag the decai __PUNCT__ but ha given no evid in hi year in massachusett of ani abil to chang the cultur or chang the polit structur or chang the govern __PUNCT__
let me be clear and i think it import given all the thing that were done in thi state over the last few week __PUNCT__
we ar not go to go out and run nasti ad __PUNCT__
we not go to go out and run __NUM__ __PUNCT__ second gut shot __PUNCT__
we not __PUNCT__ but i do reserv the right to tell the truth __PUNCT__
and if the truth seem neg __PUNCT__ that mai be more a comment on hi record than it is on polit __PUNCT__
so thi is go to be a debat that begin tomorrow morn in new hampshir __PUNCT__ and will go on for a few month __PUNCT__
and i convinc that the republican parti will pick an heir of reagan __PUNCT__ a commit conserv __PUNCT__ and somebodi with a track record of chang washington __PUNCT__
i want to sai two last thing __PUNCT__
and i think calista will join me in both of these __PUNCT__
the first is __PUNCT__ and here i think you find rick santorum sai the same thing __PUNCT__ my dad wa a career soldier for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i would not have surviv in thi campaign against million and million of dollar of neg advertis if it weren't for the thousand of volunt who show up and who help us in everi town and in everi precinct __PUNCT__
peopl went out becaus thei care __PUNCT__
there someon up here who actual drove in from indianapoli around thanksgiv and said __PUNCT__ i stai __PUNCT__
and someon els who brought three children and drove up from texa and said __PUNCT__ i stai __PUNCT__
we had peopl who want to get america back on the right track __PUNCT__
thei weren't millionair __PUNCT__ thei weren't from wall street __PUNCT__ thei didn't have a super pac __PUNCT__ but thei had courag __PUNCT__ thei had work __PUNCT__ thei were smart __PUNCT__ and togeth we surviv __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ the biggest onslaught in the histori of the iowa primari and we set the stage __PUNCT__
now i want to sai on last thing __PUNCT__
we were over earlier tonight in waterloo __PUNCT__ which had the largest singl site for caucus __PUNCT__ and a veri distant rel __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ name craig gingrich __PUNCT__ who came from pennsylvania where hi great __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ grandfath came from __PUNCT__ spoke for me __PUNCT__

and part of what he said to hi caucu wa about hi two son __PUNCT__ who had just come back from serv in the middl east __PUNCT__
and it remind me __PUNCT__
and i would like to close with thi becaus i think it so import __PUNCT__
it why the iowa experi and the new hampshir experi __PUNCT__ the place where you actual have to see peopl __PUNCT__ you can't just bui tv ad or us robo call __PUNCT__ but in the end it peopl __PUNCT__
thi process is what thei risk their live to preserv __PUNCT__
thi process of peopl come togeth __PUNCT__ share valu __PUNCT__ share fear and dream __PUNCT__ find a wai to come and get it to work __PUNCT__ unlik the current total mess in washington __PUNCT__ which i believ __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ is a bipartisan mess __PUNCT__
unlik the current mess in washington __PUNCT__ the american system over time work when the american peopl roll up their sleev to make it work __PUNCT__
and everi on of us need to rememb __PUNCT__ it part of what made these neg ad so shame __PUNCT__ everi on of us should rememb thi process surviv becaus young men and women risk their live to allow us to do thi __PUNCT__
we should act worthi of them __PUNCT__
