and peopl need to understand that __PUNCT__
thi is a decis so total outrag __PUNCT__ and then the illustr of such radic secular ideolog __PUNCT__ that i believ the entir hierarchi will oppos it everi inch of the wai __PUNCT__
it ha noth to do with specif detail __PUNCT__
it ha to do with whether or not the govern of the unit state can tell a religi institut you must give up your religi belief __PUNCT__
now that what obamacar ha come to mean __PUNCT__
the right of a washington politician and a washington bureaucrat to tell you that you mai no longer worship god the wai you want unless you will to pai a penalti for do so __PUNCT__
and i think as the averag american come to understand that __PUNCT__ thei will be repuls at the arrog and the anti __PUNCT__ religi bigotri of the obama administr __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ back there __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ speaker __PUNCT__ have you consid also that perhap voter just aren't bui what you sell __PUNCT__ i mean you been on the ball now in five state __PUNCT__ you won on but you lost four __PUNCT__
and you also talk about debat __PUNCT__ but you had __NUM__ of them and gener you been consid to have done well in them __PUNCT__ and still it not show up in the poll __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ crosstalk __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ i not go to defend the outcom in a state where i wa outspent __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and i suggest you sophist enough you understand that the idea of take a state where the other gui spent five time as much monei __PUNCT__ and mani of hi ad were fals __PUNCT__ as describ by both the __PUNCT__ wall street journal __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ nation review __PUNCT__ that mayb that not a veri accur measur __PUNCT__
when it wa an entir posit campaign __PUNCT__ up through mid __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i wa ahead by __NUM__ point in the gallup __PUNCT__
i want to come back __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ i wa actual ahead in gallup about a week ago __PUNCT__
so i think in a few more week i be ahead in gallup again __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ is that just ignor the realiti of the campaign __PUNCT__ i mean he ha gone neg and it work __PUNCT__ and you know __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
so throughout the campaign __PUNCT__ to us your word __PUNCT__ he ha gone neg __PUNCT__ and it is work __PUNCT__
and what i assert to you is over time __PUNCT__ i don't believ the american peopl will approv of a campaign which actual suppress turnout __PUNCT__
i think it amaz __PUNCT__ if you all look at florida __PUNCT__ everi counti i carri in florida had an increas turnout __PUNCT__
everi counti romnei carri in florida had a decreas turnout __PUNCT__
now that just sober __PUNCT__ everi republican in the countri __PUNCT__ if the onli wai that romnei is suppress turnout __PUNCT__ how is he go to __PUNCT__ how is he go to do that in the fall if the onli wai he win is outspend somebodi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ how is that go to appli to a campaign against obama who is go to outspend him __PUNCT__ i just suggest here that there ar underli factor in thi race __PUNCT__ and i quit happi to continu campaign __PUNCT__ and i kind of mildli amaz at the new media desper for find some excus to sai __PUNCT__ wouldn't you pleas quit thi even __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ jeff __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ success go forward __PUNCT__ mitt romnei is still in the path the wai hi record now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__
gingrich __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i not sure that mitt romnei is in my head __PUNCT__
i mean think that an interest analysi on your part __PUNCT__
i sure that with a psychiatr degre that will get you a tremend opportun to have new client __PUNCT__
i think there a clear contrast __PUNCT__
i think that the clear contrast is realli import __PUNCT__
and i think that over time we go to drive home that clear contrast in a wai which will be enorm to hi disadvantag __PUNCT__
i think the american peopl want somebodi who is genuin conserv __PUNCT__ who is prepar to chang washington __PUNCT__
just take __PUNCT__ take hi on comment thi week about not care about the poor __PUNCT__ which we know wa a mistak __PUNCT__
just as common about like to fire peopl wa a mistak __PUNCT__
et cetera __PUNCT__
i would suggest to you that a conserv who care about the poor __PUNCT__ a conserv who care about everi american of everi background __PUNCT__ a conserv who sai __PUNCT__ why don't we rethink the entir safeti net so it becom a trampolin __PUNCT__ which is not me __PUNCT__
it jack kemp __PUNCT__
it a whole rang of peopl who been work on these idea for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and as charl krauthamm said __PUNCT__ romnei comment thi week were a sign he doesn't quit understand conserv philosophi __PUNCT__
now i think that import for the countri __PUNCT__ for republican __PUNCT__ for conserv to think about __PUNCT__
nomin on more moder __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ when we lost badli __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ when we lost badli __PUNCT__ i don't think that a veri good futur for the republican parti __PUNCT__
and becaus it vital to beat barack obama __PUNCT__ i don't think it a veri good futur for the countri __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
i wa just __PUNCT__ i wa surpris __PUNCT__
go back and look at the second debat __PUNCT__
i never had a person stand next to me in a civil engag and be a substanti dishonest as he wa __PUNCT__
i mean go look at what he said __PUNCT__
you have larri sabato in the middl of the debat tweet that romnei wa be factual fals __PUNCT__
now i didn't have ani good mechan __PUNCT__ i will by the next debat __PUNCT__
i didn't have ani good mechan to turn to somebodi who wa be blatantli dishonest to the entir countri as a candid to the presid __PUNCT__
if you can't tell the truth as a candid for the presid __PUNCT__ which is by the wai a charg that ha been made by mccain __PUNCT__ by fred thompson __PUNCT__ by huckabe __PUNCT__
if you can't tell the truth as a candid for presid __PUNCT__ how can the countri possibl expect you to lead as presid __PUNCT__ and i frankli wa stun __PUNCT__
i make no bone about thi __PUNCT__
in the second florida debat __PUNCT__ i had noth to sai __PUNCT__ becaus i had noth to sai becaus i had never befor seen a person who i thought of as a seriou candid for presid be that fundament dishonest __PUNCT__
and it wa blatant and it wa deliber and he knew he wa do it __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ do you plan on deal with that __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__ i don't want to tell you now __PUNCT__
pleas __PUNCT__ jeff __PUNCT__ you have to give us a few trade secret __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ ma'am __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ you mention that romnei __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i think thi is a state he won last time __PUNCT__
i think we will do better than john mccain did last time __PUNCT__
and john mccain went on to a reason good success __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ ma'am __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ i haven't seen __PUNCT__ i haven't seen the report __PUNCT__
i have no idea what thei refer to __PUNCT__
and i be happi to look at them __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ last night you said you asham of the neg in thi campaign __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ have you engag yourself in ani neg in thi campaign __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ and ar you will to commit to give up ani neg for the remaind of __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ you can't unilater disarm in a world where somebodi is will to be as aggress __PUNCT__
what __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ if you asham of it __PUNCT__ why not __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ becaus as you know __PUNCT__ as a realist person __PUNCT__ you might as well withdraw from the campaign __PUNCT__
now that a fact __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ you don't think you could win thi campaign with a posit __PUNCT__ pure posit __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i tri that __PUNCT__ i think if you were with me in iowa saw it __PUNCT__
i stai relentlessli posit in iowa and lost __NUM__ point __PUNCT__
when we were in a total posit campaign __PUNCT__ i wa beat romnei by huge margin __PUNCT__
report __PUNCT__ so if you asham of it but __PUNCT__ crosstalk __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ i think it terribl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ becaus i think it terribl that the american system is reduc to neg ad __PUNCT__ some of them fals __PUNCT__
i wish it wasn't happen __PUNCT__ and i think we would be better serv our children and grandchildren if it wasn't happen __PUNCT__
but it a fact __PUNCT__
it is a fact __PUNCT__
and unfortun it a fact and if you not will to stand and fight __PUNCT__ then you have to get out of the race __PUNCT__
and i think that a veri sad comment __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ ma'am __PUNCT__ keilar __PUNCT__ some sourc have suggest that you decid you want to go more posit in the tone __PUNCT__ but that doesn't realli seem to match your new confer __PUNCT__
so is that true and what do you want to see about the tone move forward __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we go to make a whole seri of posit speech __PUNCT__
and again __PUNCT__ i perfectli happi to talk about the idea of turn the safeti net into a trampolin __PUNCT__
i perfectli happi to talk about idea we have for creat a much better futur in term of tax cut and less regul __PUNCT__
i gave an entir speech last night at a local church __PUNCT__ which wa a posit statement about american exception and the natur of america __PUNCT__
and i veri happi to do that __PUNCT__
i also predict to you that it is rel harder to get your profess to cover total posit speech __PUNCT__
so i can give hour and hour of total posit speech __PUNCT__
now that doesn't necessarili mean thei show up anywher __PUNCT__
keilar __PUNCT__ is it posit __PUNCT__ newt __PUNCT__ if i mai follow __PUNCT__ is it posit about __PUNCT__ is it a posit messag about america futur but neg about mitt romnei __PUNCT__ is that the plan __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think the point is __PUNCT__ there is a posit futur for america if we elect a conserv __PUNCT__ and i happi to talk about why that true and i happi to talk about why i think it veri __PUNCT__ veri hard for somebodi who invent romneycar to be part of that futur __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ ma'am __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ the articl that mistakenli said that trump would endors you __PUNCT__ do you think that wa __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ anywai __PUNCT__ and ar you hope to find other endors __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ i mean i couldn't understand those articl when thei came out becaus nobodi i knew thought he wa go to endors me __PUNCT__
so we all thought it wa kind of weird __PUNCT__
and those of you who wrote those articl ought to go back to their sourc and ask why thei misinform you __PUNCT__
but it a free countri __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ there ar few peopl better at manipul the press than donald trump and he prove it onc again __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ you have to admir the sheer __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ ma'am __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ you cheer the fact that you don't us polit consult in your campaign __PUNCT__ the explan that we gotten mani time is that you ar the brain behind in thi __PUNCT__ the machin behind your campaign __PUNCT__
you talk about not respond quickli enough to governor romnei __PUNCT__
do you think that if you would had consult __PUNCT__ it would have been differ and ar you look at ad consult move forward __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
it wouldn't have been __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ how is a consult go to train you in advanc and sai to you in advanc __PUNCT__ i mean until i saw __PUNCT__ the new york time __PUNCT__ articl about the discuss thei had last sundai morn __PUNCT__ it hadn't occur to me that you would have the level of ruthless and the level of dishonesti we saw last week __PUNCT__
and i been around a long time and have been through a fair number of campaign and a fair number of fight __PUNCT__
and the languag in that articl is startl and i think frankli __PUNCT__ a break with the american tradit __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ report __PUNCT__ is it fair to sai you ar run your campaign and you ar your own campaign manag __PUNCT__ gingrich __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i think michael crow is the campaign manag __PUNCT__
we have a lot of veri smart peopl __PUNCT__ but it fair to sai that when it come to what the candid doe and what the candid sai __PUNCT__ that i bear full respons __PUNCT__
i don't get talk point __PUNCT__ i don't get coach in a sens that appar governor romnei did until thei fire the gui who wa coach him __PUNCT__ which i think is by the wai pretti bizarr __PUNCT__
i mean here you have a gui who come in and doe a pretti good job __PUNCT__
