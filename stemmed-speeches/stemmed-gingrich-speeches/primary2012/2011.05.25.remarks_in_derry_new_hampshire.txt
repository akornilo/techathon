the derri new wrote __PUNCT__ __URL__ derri medic center __PUNCT__ a famili practic found __NUM__ year ago by a scottish doctor look to escap a volum __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ nation health care system __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ thing have chang tremend over the year and now we sort of micromanag peopl live __PUNCT__ but we do a lot more for chronic diseas identif and manag __PUNCT__ said dr __PUNCT__ ted brook __PUNCT__ a physician at the derri center __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we ar veri concern that that be directli threaten by what is essenti a nation health care system that we don't have ani control over __PUNCT__
there could be no better place to discuss the differ between local led __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ patient health and healthcar and the obamacar washington base bureaucrat control of our live __PUNCT__
it is on thing to have a lot of person health decis decid local by you __PUNCT__ your doctor __PUNCT__ and your pharmacist __PUNCT__
it is a veri differ and veri danger system if those decis ar made by a washington bureaucrat who doesn't know you __PUNCT__ ha never seen your person health record __PUNCT__ and doesn't even have a medic degre __PUNCT__
there ar mani outstand exampl of __PUNCT__ local __PUNCT__ provid better health solut __PUNCT__
at the center for health transform we have spent year find great solut at a person __PUNCT__ doctor and local commun level __PUNCT__
grand rapid michigan ha a veri effect local solut in the spectrum health system __PUNCT__
as rich devo __PUNCT__ the founder of amwai said __PUNCT__ grand rapid is proof health can be solv local when it can not be solv in washington __PUNCT__ similarli __PUNCT__ the gunderson __PUNCT__ lutheran system in lacross __PUNCT__ wisconsin ha a veri effect end of life care program which bring patient __PUNCT__ famili and doctor togeth in a care __PUNCT__ sensit and person process __PUNCT__
no washington bureaucraci can do that __PUNCT__
todai we have reach a moment of crisi in america __PUNCT__
more american ar without job __PUNCT__ and for longer period of time __PUNCT__ than at ani time in our histori sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ more peopl depend on assist from govern program than at ani other time in america histori __PUNCT__
solv thi crisi of unemploy and a grow and destruct depend on govern will requir the commit __PUNCT__ persever __PUNCT__ and hard work __PUNCT__ not of ani on man or woman __PUNCT__ but of american from everi walk of life who ar unit by a belief in freedom and self __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
in everi arena in which washington ha overstep it constitut boundari or grown too larg and ineffect __PUNCT__ we must reassert the principl that we the peopl ar the sourc of author __PUNCT__ power __PUNCT__ wealth __PUNCT__ and freedom in american societi __PUNCT__
to restor that relationship between the govern and the govern __PUNCT__ we must move power out of washington and return it to the american peopl __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ th amend is the constitut reset mechan and in the cours of thi campaign i will demonstr why a return of power to the state and to the peopl base on the __NUM__ th amend is so urgent need todai __PUNCT__
thi mean reject a govern of we the bureaucrat and replac it with a govern of __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ and for the american peopl __PUNCT__
the choic between a washington base obamacar and a tenth amend develop of local could not be clearer __PUNCT__
the patient protect and afford care act __PUNCT__ also known as obamacar __PUNCT__ is unconstitut __PUNCT__ unafford __PUNCT__ unwork __PUNCT__ and stunningli unfair __PUNCT__
obamacar so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ individu mandat __PUNCT__ is a blatantli unconstitut and unpreced expans of feder power __PUNCT__
if the feder govern can coerc individu __PUNCT__ by threat of fine __PUNCT__ to bui health insur __PUNCT__ there is no stop the feder govern from forc american to bui ani good or servic __PUNCT__
if the suprem court find such coercion to be constitut __PUNCT__ it would mean the judici branch ha given up on limit constitut __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
it would mean that the judg believ there is no constitut barrier to protect the individu against the absolut and arbitrari power of the state __PUNCT__
that why i have publicli support the effort of attornei gener cuccinelli of virginia in hi lawsuit and the __NUM__ attornei __PUNCT__ gener throughout the countri who have challeng the constitution of obamacar __PUNCT__
it also why i becam the first presidenti candid to sign the independ women voic __PUNCT__ obamacar repeal pledg __PUNCT__ last week in iowa __PUNCT__
and it is why i will fight for the repeal of obamacar until it is repeal in it entireti __PUNCT__
obamacar is not onli unconstitut __PUNCT__ it design is insult to the vision of the founder who carefulli creat a govern of enumer and limit power __PUNCT__ not a govern of unlimit and open __PUNCT__ end power __PUNCT__
the law creat on thousand __PUNCT__ nine hundr and sixti eight separ grant of power to bureaucrat __PUNCT__ most of them to the secretari of health and human servic and her bureaucraci __PUNCT__
it creat __NUM__ new board __PUNCT__ agenc and other govern entiti to administ health decis that should be up to the individu in consult with their doctor __PUNCT__
thi unpreced grant of discretionari power to unelect bureaucrat guarante the rise in arbitrari and corrupt decis __PUNCT__ make by the feder govern __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ we ar alreadi see how the american belief in the rule of law is betrai in the implement of obamacar __PUNCT__
to date __PUNCT__ the obama administr ha issu over on thousand waiver to exempt compani and organ from compli with the law expens mandat __PUNCT__ includ big labor and other power support of the democrat parti __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ a report emerg that show nearli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the latest round of waiver ar in former hous speaker nanci pelosi congression district __PUNCT__
thi process provid glare proof of the corrupt natur of big govern and why our founder distrust central power __PUNCT__
the american peopl will not stand for such a corrupt __PUNCT__ unconstitut state of affair __PUNCT__
obamacar will be repeal __PUNCT__ as will similar program in the state __PUNCT__
in addit to the unconstitut natur of individu and employ mandat __PUNCT__ we ar learn that thei simpli don't work __PUNCT__
their intract problem is thi __PUNCT__ onc you have a mandat __PUNCT__ the govern ha to specifi exactli what coverag must be includ in insur for it to qualifi __PUNCT__
thi introduc polit consider into determin these minimum standard __PUNCT__ guarante that noth desir by the special interest will be left out __PUNCT__
and onc the govern mandat such expens insur __PUNCT__ the govern becom respons for it cost __PUNCT__
it ha to adopt expens subsidi to help peopl pai for the expens plan that it is requir __PUNCT__
the result cost to the taxpay and strain on the budget lead the govern to try and control healthcar cost by limit health care servic __PUNCT__
the inevit result is ration by a nameless __PUNCT__ faceless __PUNCT__ unaccount board of govern bureaucrat __PUNCT__
thi ha been the sad __PUNCT__ unwork path now be follow governor duval patrick in massachusett and it is now the same sad unwork path unfold in washington __PUNCT__
we must either limit govern or we will have govern limit us __PUNCT__
as i carri the banner in fight for the repeal of obamacar __PUNCT__ i will advoc for specif replac health polici that will creat a free market framework for healthcar __PUNCT__ provid afford __PUNCT__ portabl __PUNCT__ and reliabl healthcar coverag __PUNCT__ and establish a health care safeti net focus on those in need __PUNCT__
thi system will assur health care for all with no individu mandat or employ mandat of ani kind __PUNCT__
thi altern to obamacar begin with patient power and local __PUNCT__
instead of an individu mandat penalti for not bui govern approv health insur __PUNCT__ the feder tax code should be reform to provid everi american the choic of a gener tax credit or the abil to deduct the valu of their health insur up to a certain amount __PUNCT__
the feder tax code should provid the same tax relief for the individu bui hi own insur as the employ provid health insur to it employe __PUNCT__
thi will lower cost for individu and famili __PUNCT__ and will make it easier for peopl to obtain portabl insur thei can with them from job to job __PUNCT__
if you don't like your employ insur __PUNCT__ you get the same tax relief if you bui the insur of your choic __PUNCT__
employ should also be allow to bui individu own insur for their employe __PUNCT__ instead of non __PUNCT__ portabl __PUNCT__ group insur __PUNCT__
thi approach provid a foundat of equal fair for all __PUNCT__ rather than the favorit and rank discrimin of the obamacar bureaucraci and the current system __PUNCT__
we should extend health save account throughout the health care system __PUNCT__
everyon on medicar should be free to choos an hsa as part of their coverag if thei want it __PUNCT__
everyon on medicaid should be free to choos an hsa for part of their coverag __PUNCT__
all worker should be free to us their health insur tax credit or deduct to choos an hsa in place of their employ provid health insur if thei desir __PUNCT__
these ar a few exampl of reform that we can enact __PUNCT__ onc obamacar is repeal __PUNCT__ that will transform our current healthcar system into on center on the individu __PUNCT__ where patient and doctor have power __PUNCT__ not washington bureaucrat __PUNCT__
the second step in reestablish the constitut relationship between govern and we the peopl is put american back to work __PUNCT__
it start with a simpl organ principl __PUNCT__ job kill polici kill job __PUNCT__
we must identifi job __PUNCT__ kill polici __PUNCT__ and then end them or replac them with job creat polici __PUNCT__
america ha face recess befor and recov quickli __PUNCT__
sinc world war ii __PUNCT__ recess have last an averag of __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
the longest wa __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ forti month after the recess began __PUNCT__ unemploy is actual go back up __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ last month __PUNCT__
wors __PUNCT__ if you count those who have stop look for a job or ar work part time when thei would prefer to work full time __PUNCT__ the real unemploy rate is at a stagger __NUM__ __PUNCT__
histor __PUNCT__ the wors the econom downturn __PUNCT__ the stronger is the recoveri __PUNCT__
base on previou histori __PUNCT__ america should be enjoi the second year of a roar econom recoveri by now __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ while the reagan recoveri averag __NUM__ __PUNCT__ econom growth over the first __NUM__ quarter __PUNCT__ the current so __PUNCT__ call recoveri ha produc less than half that at __NUM__ __PUNCT__ with the last quarter at a dismal __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the normal resili of the american economi is be held back by the destruct impact of big govern __PUNCT__
instead of try to creat job with wast stimulu spend __PUNCT__ we need a govern that get out of the wai and allow the american peopl to creat job and prosper again __PUNCT__
that start with cut tax and cut spend __PUNCT__
we should continu what ha work by make the current tax rate perman __PUNCT__ stop the __NUM__ tax increas __PUNCT__ and by repeal obamacar and it tax increas __PUNCT__
next we must make america onc again the most desir countri in the world for job creat invest __PUNCT__
to do thi we need a bold seri of four tax cut __PUNCT__
we should elimin the capit gain tax __PUNCT__ as mani of our intern competitor have done __PUNCT__ to make american entrepreneur more competit and to attract billion of new invest __PUNCT__
we should reduc america corpor tax rate __PUNCT__ now the highest in the industri world __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we should allow for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ expens of invest in new equip __PUNCT__ allow farmer __PUNCT__ factori __PUNCT__ doctor __PUNCT__ hospit and all busi to write off all new equip in on year __PUNCT__
thi will ensur that american worker can onc again emploi the most technolog advanc tool in the most advanc factori and be the most product in the world __PUNCT__
we should perman end the death tax and it doubl taxat on the lifetim save of american __PUNCT__
we also need sever pro __PUNCT__ growth regulatori reform that remov obstacl to job creation __PUNCT__
we should repeal the costli __PUNCT__ ineffect __PUNCT__ and job kill sarban oxlei act __PUNCT__
we should replac the job kill epa with an environment solut agenc __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we need an american energi polici that favor cheap gasolin __PUNCT__ cheap diesel fuel __PUNCT__ cheap natur ga __PUNCT__ and cheap electr __PUNCT__
cheap american energi will lead to more job __PUNCT__ greater econom growth __PUNCT__ and wealthier american __PUNCT__
thi would seem to be an all too obviou goal for the countri __PUNCT__ except for the fact that the obama administr pursu explicit polici that lead to expens gasolin __PUNCT__ expens diesel __PUNCT__ expens natur ga __PUNCT__ and skyrocket electr cost __PUNCT__
these anti __PUNCT__ american energi polici ar kill job and make us all poorer __PUNCT__
we need an all __PUNCT__ out effort to increas domest oil and drill __PUNCT__ includ the develop of oil shale resourc in the american west __PUNCT__ where we have an estim three time as much oil as saudi arabia __PUNCT__
we don't have to wait year for ga price to come down __PUNCT__
an aggress commit now to develop more of our abund oil and natur ga resourc will put downward pressur on price at the pump long befor ani new reserv actual come onlin __PUNCT__
that not wish think __PUNCT__
that call the law of suppli and demand __PUNCT__ which take into account todai what go to happen in the futur __PUNCT__
the combin of pro __PUNCT__ growth tax reform __PUNCT__ control spend __PUNCT__ a return to sound monei and an american energi plan will lead to strong econom growth __PUNCT__ a dramat declin in unemploy __PUNCT__ and low inflat __PUNCT__
the return to prosper and the reestablish of the proper constitut balanc between govern and the govern will not be an easi task __PUNCT__
but protect our freedom ha never been easi __PUNCT__
the elect of __NUM__ is the most import elect of our lifetim __PUNCT__
down the left hand road li a washington bureaucraci run our live in a corrupt system defin by politician __PUNCT__
down our road li the rebirth of freedom __PUNCT__ the reassert of the constitut and the renew of the american economi __PUNCT__
i am run for presid to chang washington decis __PUNCT__ reinforc obedi to the constitut and reestablish the core principl of the declar of independ __PUNCT__
thi campaign will requir a team effort __PUNCT__ with everi american who believ as i do that the futur of american liberti requir a recommit to the timeless principl of our countri found __PUNCT__ that everi man __PUNCT__ woman __PUNCT__ and child is endow by our creator with certain unalien right __PUNCT__
