i been do a littl bit of campaign for liberti for a long time __PUNCT__
let me tell you someth big is happen in thi countri and it all veri favor __PUNCT__
the mess up in washington thei have creat a mess that ha given a lousi foreign polici __PUNCT__
thei have given a lousi budget and lousi recess __PUNCT__ but wonder thing that is happen in the grassroot __PUNCT__
peopl ar begin to realiz that the problem is too much govern __PUNCT__
we need more person liberti __PUNCT__ thi is where we win the heart and mind of peopl __PUNCT__
the number ar grow __PUNCT__
i tell you what __PUNCT__
there ar mani brush fire of freedom be lit across thi countri todai __PUNCT__
we don't even know where thei ar there ar so mani __PUNCT__
it be translat to great enthusiasm and chang __PUNCT__ the chang that we need __PUNCT__
we don't need to have more govern __PUNCT__
we need to get rid of some of the process of govern __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ don't you think it about time we have a new monetari polici __PUNCT__
and all we have to do is read the constitut __PUNCT__ thei tell us exactli what we suppos to have __PUNCT__
what about a foreign polici __PUNCT__ we need a foreign polici __PUNCT__ but do we have to inconveni it __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ all we have to do is read the constitut we need a strong nation defens __PUNCT__
we don't need to be the policemen of the world __PUNCT__
veri simpli we should not engag ani war that ar not declar properli and support by the peopl __PUNCT__
i gotten some advic on the internet everi onc in a while __PUNCT__
and the advic is __PUNCT__ ron __PUNCT__ if you would just chang your foreign polici __PUNCT__ you would get a few support __PUNCT__
if thei onli knew that the support for the freedom movement come with a sound econom and a sound foreign polici that make sens __PUNCT__
veri simpli __PUNCT__ it mean bring our troop home and stop all these undeclar __PUNCT__ unwinn war __PUNCT__
what would it do for our economi __PUNCT__ i would like to see troop spend their monei at home __PUNCT__
in the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ fight these unwinn and undeclar war we have spent over __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
more in the debt for thi so at a cost of life and limb __PUNCT__ but there is an econom cost __PUNCT__ as well and the american peopl ar tire of it __PUNCT__
thei ar readi becaus thei know thi countri is bankrupt __PUNCT__
all great nation go down becaus thei overextend themselv oversea __PUNCT__
it time for us to wake up __PUNCT__ don't wait for an econom crisi to hit when we have to come limp home __PUNCT__
we ought to rise up __PUNCT__ spend our monei wise and defend thi countri and don't present fend to tell other peopl how to live __PUNCT__
the greatest danger when we accept the notion that the govern is suppos todai take care of us and we suppos to policemen of the world all is done at expens of person liberti __PUNCT__
the purpos of the govern is the protect of individu liberti for each and everi on of us __PUNCT__
we need to revers thi trend on the attack on our civil liberti __PUNCT__
we need to repeal the patriot act __PUNCT__
we need to repeal the provis that the presid ha the author to assassin american citizen without trial __PUNCT__
we need repeal the provis that sai the presid can us the militari to arrest and deni them a trial __PUNCT__
veri simpli __PUNCT__ send onli peopl to washington __PUNCT__ send onli peopl to the white hous that know and understand and read the constitut and enforc the constitut __PUNCT__
then there would be __PUNCT__ then you would have the full understand how you would have a peac thrive nation if you enforc the concept of liberti __PUNCT__ enforc the liberti for each and everi on of us equal __PUNCT__
thi bring peopl togeth becaus peopl will us their liberti in differ manner __PUNCT__ but we don't have to fight over how thei us their liberti as long as thei assum respons for themselv and consequ of all their action __PUNCT__
it also veri simpli suggest the fact if we have a right to life and liberti we should have a right to keep the fruit of our labor as well __PUNCT__
so we don't have to reinvent someth __PUNCT__ we can improv on our past but we had a great constitut and a great middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ biggest middl __PUNCT__ class ever __PUNCT__
we undermin it with excess taxat and a monetari system that is flaw and foreign polici is flaw __PUNCT__
so all we have to do is return to our root and in a short time __PUNCT__ we could have our peac and prosper and our relianc on ourselv for our person liberti __PUNCT__
not onli ha thi been a great dai for campaign for liberti and thi process __PUNCT__ but it been a great week for the campaign __PUNCT__
believ me it been a great past four year becaus five or six or seven year ago __PUNCT__ thei realli didn't know exactli what wa happen __PUNCT__
but with the crisi that that hit __PUNCT__ both the econom crisi we had four year ago __PUNCT__ the realiz of the signific of our feder reserv system as well as flaw foreign polici __PUNCT__ the peopl know about it __PUNCT__
thei ar awaken to thi __PUNCT__
thei ar listen to thi messag __PUNCT__
it up to us to do someth about it __PUNCT__
the messag is loud and clear the enthusiasm is here __PUNCT__ but it ha to be translat to proper polit action __PUNCT__
