you know __PUNCT__ we talk about __PUNCT__ and a.j __PUNCT__

and on of two that can actual run a nation campaign and rais the monei __PUNCT__
but there nobodi els that have peopl like you work hard and enthusiast and believ in someth __PUNCT__
that is all the differ in the world __PUNCT__
and befor i continu with anymor comment __PUNCT__ i do want to bring __PUNCT__ at least step forward three __PUNCT__ three of our chairmen __PUNCT__
you met alreadi __PUNCT__ a.j __PUNCT__
stryker and david fisher __PUNCT__ would step forward __PUNCT__ as well as drew iver __PUNCT__ who been the chairman __PUNCT__ and thei ar on the central committe and thei have led the charg all throughout iowa __PUNCT__
but all i can think about in tough campaign and all the hard work is the work you peopl do __PUNCT__
it is unbeliev __PUNCT__ the energi you have and the effort that you have made __PUNCT__
but what make me feel good about it is you do it becaus you believ in someth __PUNCT__
that is what worthwhil __PUNCT__
but you __PUNCT__ but you also __PUNCT__ also know that there two good thing __PUNCT__
some peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you gui just do that becaus you believ in someth to promot a caus __PUNCT__
certainli __PUNCT__ but how the best wai to promot a caus __PUNCT__ that is to win elect __PUNCT__
that wai you promot it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the enthusiasm ha been unbeliev __PUNCT__
it fantast __PUNCT__
it nation __PUNCT__
thousand of peopl now have been involv __PUNCT__ and not onli in iowa __PUNCT__ but around the countri __PUNCT__ and thei readi and rare to go __PUNCT__
but we have to look at wonder chang that have occur in our countri in a posit wai __PUNCT__
the countri ha suffer a lot in a neg wai __PUNCT__
the economi in troubl __PUNCT__ our civil liberti ar be trash __PUNCT__ our foreign polici ha been a mess and drain us __PUNCT__ both econom and our militari forc __PUNCT__
but at the same time __PUNCT__ peopl ar come togeth and we had the task __PUNCT__ which is where we ar veri success is reintroduc some idea the republican need for a long time __PUNCT__ and that is __PUNCT__ that is the convict that freedom is popular __PUNCT__
but onc again __PUNCT__ we have had a fantast show for thi caus and challeng peopl __PUNCT__
not the statu quo that we have been put up with for decad after decad __PUNCT__ but challeng them and sai __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ let challeng him __PUNCT__
let go back to thi real old __PUNCT__ fashion idea __PUNCT__ thi veri danger idea __PUNCT__
let obei the constitut __PUNCT__
and too __PUNCT__ too often __PUNCT__ those who preach limit govern and small govern __PUNCT__ thei forget that invas of your privaci is big govern __PUNCT__ and we have to emphas protect your person right and your econom right ar what the govern suppos to do __PUNCT__
thei not suppos to run our live or spend our monei __PUNCT__
and also __PUNCT__ along those line __PUNCT__ what we have introduc with so much enthusiasm __PUNCT__ i hear it so often from so mani volunt __PUNCT__
the other dai somebodi came up to me and he wa refresh my memori __PUNCT__ becaus he knew i knew the statement __PUNCT__ becaus i said it __PUNCT__
back in the old dai in the earli __PUNCT__ 70 __PUNCT__ nixon said __PUNCT__ we all keynesian now __PUNCT__ which meant that even the republican __PUNCT__ thei accept liber econom __PUNCT__
he said i wait for the dai where we can sai __PUNCT__ we all austrian now __PUNCT__
but a biggest chang __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ in intellectu and polit chang that we have brought about is the emphasi on a veri import matter __PUNCT__
make sure we get to the bottom of the ultim bail __PUNCT__ outer and that is our feder reserv system __PUNCT__
we need reform there and we need a new monetari system and obei the constitut __PUNCT__
thi is __PUNCT__ thi is someth that we made great progress __PUNCT__
so the first and initi import step that we work so hard is on the tabl __PUNCT__
todai there wa a nation poll that came out and thei were talk about how mani peopl support the gold standard __PUNCT__ how long ha it been sinc thei taken a nation poll on the gold standard __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ the major of the american peopl believ we should have a gold standard and not a paper standard __PUNCT__
but also __PUNCT__ also the great stride that we have made ha been realli on the foreign polici __PUNCT__
the fact that we can onc again talk in republican circl and make it credibl __PUNCT__ talk about what eisenhow said that bewar of the militari industri conflict __PUNCT__
talk about the old dai when robert taft __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ republican said that we shouldn't be engag in these entangl allianc __PUNCT__ he believ what the founder taught us __PUNCT__
he didn't want to be in nato __PUNCT__
we certainli don't need nato and the u.n __PUNCT__ to tell us when to go to war __PUNCT__
but we have __PUNCT__ we have seen a great differ __PUNCT__
the major of the american peopl ar behind us on thi whole war effort __PUNCT__
thei ar tire of the war __PUNCT__ cost too much __PUNCT__ too much monei __PUNCT__ too mani peopl get kill __PUNCT__ too mani peopl get injur __PUNCT__ too mani peopl get sick __PUNCT__
and the major __PUNCT__ mayb __NUM__ percent or __NUM__ percent of the american peopl now ar sai it time to get out of afghanistan __PUNCT__
so those ar the issu __PUNCT__ those ar the issu that we have brought front and center __PUNCT__
thei out there __PUNCT__
thei not go to go awai __PUNCT__
and we have __PUNCT__ and we have tremend opportun to continu thi momentum __PUNCT__
