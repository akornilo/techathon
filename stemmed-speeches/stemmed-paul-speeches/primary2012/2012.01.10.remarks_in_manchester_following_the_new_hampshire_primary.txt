so we ar now __PUNCT__ becaus of what is happen __PUNCT__ it will remain a domin issu __PUNCT__
there no wai thei go to put it to bed becaus thei have destroi our monei __PUNCT__
it worldwid __PUNCT__
there a financi crisi go on and it onli sound monei and person liberti that can solv the crisi that we have todai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ the on reason __PUNCT__ the on reason i talk about the monetari system so much __PUNCT__ it wa a sneaki deceit wai to pai the bill __PUNCT__
you know an honest govern want to be a big spend govern __PUNCT__ would tax the peopl and then the peopl would know what thei were do __PUNCT__
if we had to pai tax for everyth that thei do __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the peopl would rise up and stop it __PUNCT__
so then thei start borrow monei a lot and then peopl didn't notic that quit as much becaus thei didn't pass that on __PUNCT__
but then thei resort to the print of the monei __PUNCT__
and that is why the feder reserv wa establish __PUNCT__ to take care of the power interest __PUNCT__ the militari industri complex __PUNCT__ the bank system __PUNCT__ and deficit financ __PUNCT__
and there is a coupl of reason thei have deficit financ __PUNCT__
sometim there ar conserv that want deficit financ and sometim there ar liber who want deficit financ __PUNCT__
and thei have resort __PUNCT__ thei have resort to thi and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ thi is why we ar face thi crisi todai __PUNCT__
but it also serv those interest who like to think that we have thi respons __PUNCT__
thei claim it a moral respons to take our young peopl __PUNCT__ put them into the militari and send them hither and yon around the world __PUNCT__ polic the world and us up the monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ boo __PUNCT__
so just __PUNCT__ just as we have been abl to bring to the forefront that most import issu of funni monei __PUNCT__ fiat monei __PUNCT__ the paper monei system __PUNCT__ the feder reserv __PUNCT__ we have brought to the forefront __PUNCT__ other have tokenli talk about it __PUNCT__
thei get in offic and thei do noth about it __PUNCT__
bur tight now __PUNCT__ it is thi liberti movement __PUNCT__ which is seen as a patriot movement __PUNCT__ an individu liberti movement __PUNCT__ that is sai to the countri and to the world __PUNCT__ we had enough of send our kid and our monei around the world to be the policemen of the world __PUNCT__
it the time to bring them home __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ crowd __PUNCT__ bring them home __PUNCT__

crowd __PUNCT__ bring them home __PUNCT__
bring them home __PUNCT__
bring them home __PUNCT__
paul __PUNCT__ the on thing is we do know thei will come home __PUNCT__
my goal and our goal ha alwai been to bring them home in a deliber fashion __PUNCT__ to avoid major econom cri by destroi our economi by spend so much oversea __PUNCT__
in the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ the war that have gone on ad __MONEY__ trillion of debt __PUNCT__
and i don't think we have been on bit safer for it __PUNCT__
i think we have been less safe becaus of all the monei that we have spent oversea __PUNCT__
so thi is the issu now __PUNCT__ it is __PUNCT__ it is an issu that i think is crucial __PUNCT__
jim mention in the introduct that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ so often __PUNCT__ thei sai that if we tell peopl that we think we should spend less in the militari __PUNCT__ thei sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ that mean you want to cut defens __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
if you cut the militari industri complex __PUNCT__ you cut war profit but you don't take on penni out of nation defens __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ and besid __PUNCT__ besid __PUNCT__ we flat __PUNCT__ out broke __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ we did not have to fight the soviet __PUNCT__
the soviet brought themselv down for econom reason __PUNCT__
do you know that thei were so foolish and thought themselv so bold that thei could pursu their world empir that thei invad afghanistan __PUNCT__ but we will come home __PUNCT__ but if we do it now __PUNCT__ calmli and deliber __PUNCT__ we can save our economi here at home becaus there ar a lot of peopl who ar suffer here at home __PUNCT__
you have to stop the inflat becaus that what destroi the middl class and that what transfer the wealth from the poor and the middl class to the wealthi __PUNCT__
and that is why the wealthi got their bailout and the middl class shrunk and thei lost their job and thei lost their hous __PUNCT__
so thi is what we have to do __PUNCT__
we have to cut the spend __PUNCT__
thi is why i have made a token suggest in the first year in offic __PUNCT__ we would cut at least __MONEY__ trillion from the budget __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ now the on thing that __PUNCT__ the talk you hear in washington is pure talk becaus there is nobodi suggest __PUNCT__ the other candid ar not talk about real cut __PUNCT__ thei talk about cut propos increas out in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
thei sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we cut a trillion __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ a trillion over a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year period which is __MONEY__ billion everi year __PUNCT__
our nation debt is go up in real term __MONEY__ billion everi month and thei claim that cut and thei yell and scream __PUNCT__ we can't cut __PUNCT__ we can't cut __PUNCT__
we do have to cut __PUNCT__
we have to live within our mean if we want to be abl to at least take care of the peopl who have been made to be so depend on the govern __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we have to work our wai out __PUNCT__
i would sai if we did thi and cut thi oversea spend __PUNCT__ at least we might be abl to allow the social secur beneficiari to get their check and medic care be provid __PUNCT__
but if we continu to do what we do __PUNCT__ the result ar that the dollar is destroi and the whole thing come apart and it go to be a worldwid phenomena __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ alreadi __PUNCT__ social secur beneficiari ar suffer a lot __PUNCT__
their incom is shrink becaus the valu of the dollar is go down __PUNCT__ so thei get __PUNCT__ thei get their check cut __PUNCT__
and that is why you have to think about the cut and the stop of the inflat __PUNCT__
but overal __PUNCT__ you have to ask __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ as our founder did __PUNCT__ what should the role of govern be in a free societi __PUNCT__ the role should be veri simpl __PUNCT__
the protect of liberti __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ crowd __PUNCT__ ron paul revolut __PUNCT__ bring us back our constitut __PUNCT__

you know __PUNCT__ the constitut wa written for a veri precis manner __PUNCT__
it wa not design to restrain the individu __PUNCT__ not to restrain you __PUNCT__ it wa to protect your liberti and to restrain the feder govern __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ but liberti ha to be reemphas becaus we have been careless over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we have taken liberti and chop it up into piec __PUNCT__
some peopl think liberti ha to do with person habit __PUNCT__ which i agre __PUNCT__
other peopl think liberti is how to spend your monei and thei defend that part and thei fight about when to do what __PUNCT__
what we need to do is make thi emphasi that liberti mean you have a right to your life and your privaci and the wai you want to live your life as long as you don't hurt peopl and you have a right to keep and spend your monei as you want to __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ freedom is a wonder idea and that why i get so excit __PUNCT__
but i realli i get excit when i see young peopl sai it __PUNCT__
it is a wonder idea __PUNCT__
freedom is popular __PUNCT__ don't you know that __PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ now freedom bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__

but freedom __PUNCT__ if you understand it __PUNCT__ you should all fight for freedom becaus you want to exert your freedom the wai you want __PUNCT__
same wai with econom freedom __PUNCT__
it should bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__
and i think thi is on reason peopl worri about how you ever go to put the coalit or how you __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thei don't want to call it __PUNCT__
thei said __PUNCT__ how ar you go to compromis and give up some of your belief in order to get some thing pass __PUNCT__ you don't have to compromis __PUNCT__
what you have to do is emphas the coalit that peopl want their freedom for differ reason and bring them togeth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ it been __PUNCT__ america ha been the greatest countri ever __PUNCT__ the most prosper countri ever __PUNCT__ the largest middl class ever __PUNCT__
it not that wai todai __PUNCT__
our middl class is shrink __PUNCT__ the countri is get poorer __PUNCT__
the wealth is appar __PUNCT__ is base on dad __PUNCT__ the few who realli hold the wealth __PUNCT__ it maldistribut becaus it shift overdu to the regul __PUNCT__ the control of govern __PUNCT__
we have had too mani peopl too long in the last __NUM__ year think that it wa benefici more to be __PUNCT__ have high paid lobbyist to get and to find out what thei can get from the govern rather than us petit our govern in a proper manner __PUNCT__ to petit our govern and demand our freedom back again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ cheer and applaus __PUNCT__ a lot of time __PUNCT__ thei give us __PUNCT__ thei give us troubl and thei sai __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ you peopl ar just too selfish __PUNCT__ all you want to do is have your freedom __PUNCT__

all that good intent of sai __PUNCT__ we go to give everybodi a free hous and no loan and then thei can borrow against the __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the equiti __PUNCT__
and look what happen __PUNCT__
it wa the bubbl that burst and thei lost their hous __PUNCT__
so the humanitarian instinct ar there across the board __PUNCT__
what we have to convinc them __PUNCT__ if you ar a true humanitarian __PUNCT__ you have to fight and argu the case for free market __PUNCT__ sound monei __PUNCT__ properti right __PUNCT__ contract right __PUNCT__ no us of forc __PUNCT__ and a sensibl foreign polici so we don't wast our resourc __PUNCT__
