but on of the thing thei have done __PUNCT__ over these last hundr year __PUNCT__ that ha been veri detriment __PUNCT__ especi in the last forti year __PUNCT__ is that thei want govern to grow endlessli __PUNCT__
we don't have the monei __PUNCT__ thei run out of borrow power __PUNCT__ guess what thei do __PUNCT__ you would have never guess __PUNCT__

and now the world face a debt crisi __PUNCT__
and the debt crisi is a consequ __PUNCT__ a natur consequ of __PUNCT__ the predict consequ of the monetari system that we have __PUNCT__
so we embark __PUNCT__ a hundr year ago __PUNCT__ with the central bank __PUNCT__ which thoma jefferson tri so desper to prevent __PUNCT__
so thei haven't done a veri good job __PUNCT__
thei took a dollar of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the dollar of __NUM__ now it worth on penni __PUNCT__

these problem have been go on for a long time __PUNCT__
it be nice if we could blame on person or on administr __PUNCT__ but it been go on a long time __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ so mani young peopl here __PUNCT__ i think you realiz you get a bad rap for what you inherit __PUNCT__
you like a much better deal __PUNCT__
and the deal __PUNCT__ the better deal can be found in less govern and onli send peopl to washington who have actual read the constitut and will obei the constitut and take their oath of offic serious __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ which would be __PUNCT__ which would do so mani wonder thing for us __PUNCT__
take __PUNCT__ for instanc __PUNCT__ if you tire of the war __PUNCT__ i hope you sick and tire of the war that we involv in __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ what if we had the return to the constitut __PUNCT__
the founder made sure in the document in the constitut that the war would onli occur not by the execut branch __PUNCT__ but onli by the peopl __PUNCT__ through their repres in congress __PUNCT__
that the wai all war should be declar __PUNCT__
if necessari __PUNCT__ thei should be declar __PUNCT__ won __PUNCT__ and get them over with __PUNCT__ and come home __PUNCT__
that the wai it wa suppos to be done __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ but sinc __PUNCT__ sinc world war ii __PUNCT__ we have gone to war without a declar __PUNCT__
and for that reason __PUNCT__ we essenti have not won on of those war __PUNCT__
it ha ad a lot of tragedi __PUNCT__
just in these past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ these war that we fight in the middl east __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ american have di __PUNCT__ __NUM__ have come back with seriou injuri __PUNCT__ and amput and all kind of problem __PUNCT__ hundr of thousand look for help becaus of post __PUNCT__ traumat stress syndrom __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ econom it been veri damag __PUNCT__
it ha ad four trillion dollar to our nation debt __PUNCT__
that is what you inherit __PUNCT__
thi is the reason why it is so import __PUNCT__ if you talk about peac and prosper __PUNCT__ you have to chang the constitut and have a lot less war and make a lot more sincer effort to promot the caus of peac __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ but thi ha been go on for a long time __PUNCT__ and both administr have been do thi __PUNCT__ and thi is the reason that the messag of liberti actual bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__ becaus individu see that the parti aren't do a veri good job __PUNCT__
you elect on parti to cut the spend __PUNCT__ thei rais the debt and the spend __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
anoth parti is suppos to do the job __PUNCT__ thei go in and noth chang __PUNCT__
so if you look at the candid todai __PUNCT__ there is veri littl differ __PUNCT__ except for on __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ the rest __PUNCT__ the rest of the candid support the statu quo __PUNCT__
foreign polici never chang __PUNCT__
monetari polici doesn't chang __PUNCT__
there no challeng to the feder reserv system __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ there no __PUNCT__ no desir to protect person liberti __PUNCT__ person privaci __PUNCT__ protect us from the intrus of the feder govern __PUNCT__ to protect your right to us __PUNCT__ to us the internet __PUNCT__
these ar the kind of thing that ar so import to so mani peopl __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ that is not offer __PUNCT__
i believ it is the offer up of a program that __PUNCT__ that emphas person liberti __PUNCT__ the constitut __PUNCT__ sound monetari polici __PUNCT__ and a sensibl foreign polici is the reason the momentum is build and the reason why we get such a great recept here in north dakota __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ ron paul __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ we in the midst of a financi crisi __PUNCT__ the financi crisi __PUNCT__ the biggest on in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
there wa a time when we were a creditor nation __PUNCT__
we had our up and down __PUNCT__ but we were a creditor nation __PUNCT__ and we had a lot of product __PUNCT__ we had a lot of wealth __PUNCT__ and we had borrow power __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we ar a debtor nation __PUNCT__
we ar the biggest debtor nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__ our product is go down drastic __PUNCT__ we creat no signific new job __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ there is never a lack of a desir for more spend __PUNCT__
so what we should be propos __PUNCT__ and what i propos __PUNCT__ is in the first year __PUNCT__ to cut the budget __PUNCT__ in real term __PUNCT__ by on trillion dollar __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ the propos by other is to cut the propos increas __PUNCT__
the propos increas __PUNCT__ call baselin budget __PUNCT__ thei assum that the budget will go up by __NUM__ plu trillion dollar in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
so if thei talk about cut on trillion dollar __PUNCT__ thei talk about cut on trillion dollar __PUNCT__ thei talk about cut __NUM__ billion dollar a year of propos increas __PUNCT__ which mean there zero cut __PUNCT__ what i talk about ar real cut __PUNCT__
actual cut __PUNCT__
but you can't do thi unless you chang polici __PUNCT__
if you expect to have the entitl system __PUNCT__ have welfar benefit from cradl to grave __PUNCT__ free hous __PUNCT__ free food and free medic care __PUNCT__ and free educ __PUNCT__ you can't do it __PUNCT__
if you expect to continu to be the policeman of the world __PUNCT__ and to advoc preemptiv war and go into __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ countri and occupi countri __PUNCT__ if you want that kind of foreign polici __PUNCT__ you cannot do it __PUNCT__
and you know what happen if we don't chang polici __PUNCT__ we ar go to end up in a financi crash __PUNCT__
there is go to be a dollar crisi __PUNCT__ and we ar all gonna suffer the consequ __PUNCT__
so it is in our best interest __PUNCT__ not onli of the younger gener but everybodi __PUNCT__ we not pass thi on to the next gener __PUNCT__
we pass it on to thi current gener __PUNCT__ that is why it so vital that we get a handl on thing __PUNCT__ understand what liberti is all about __PUNCT__ what the constitut mean __PUNCT__ and why limit govern and person liberti and properti right is the road to peac and prosper __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ it ha __PUNCT__ it ha been said that no armi can stop an idea whose time ha come __PUNCT__
and the idea of return thi countri to the principl of liberti __PUNCT__ that aliv and well __PUNCT__ aliv and well and grow by leap and bound __PUNCT__ and that is why thi countri is chang significantli __PUNCT__
the messag is loud and clear __PUNCT__ and grow exponenti __PUNCT__ and i am optimist __PUNCT__ to believ that we can turn thi around __PUNCT__ but we have to cut the spend __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl sai __PUNCT__ you go to cut thi __PUNCT__ thi and thi __PUNCT__
and i actual have a transit program __PUNCT__
i wanna cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ but i wanna have prioriti __PUNCT__
i wanna realli start with the oversea spend __PUNCT__
the oversea spend __PUNCT__ and the welfar __PUNCT__ and the occup __PUNCT__ we oughta all be abl to agre __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ spend the monei here at home if you have to __PUNCT__ but not oversea __PUNCT__ audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ so therefor __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i want to protect certain budget problem __PUNCT__ budget program __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ we made promis to the elderli __PUNCT__ thei depend now __PUNCT__ medicar __PUNCT__ social secur and child healthcar __PUNCT__
and actual __PUNCT__ my plan will actual protect those individu __PUNCT__
what about protect the infrastructur __PUNCT__ protect those state and part of the countri that need monei for __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ port and inter __PUNCT__ coastal canal __PUNCT__ and flood project __PUNCT__ would i vote for that __PUNCT__ and would i advoc it by ad more debt and borrow it __PUNCT__ no i would not __PUNCT__
but let me tell you how we could do it __PUNCT__
we could do it by cut spend oversea to such an extent __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ you actual cut the deficit and put the monei that you want to __PUNCT__ for some program __PUNCT__ back here at home __PUNCT__
not to rais tax and not to rais the def __PUNCT__ ah __PUNCT__ the debt __PUNCT__ and actual to lower the debt __PUNCT__ and don't increas the spend __PUNCT__
we can do that by work our wai out __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ there __PUNCT__ a few year ago __PUNCT__ thei built an embassi in baghdad __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ boo __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ an embassi we didn't need __PUNCT__
and it wa close to a billion dollar __PUNCT__
but that wa onli the begin __PUNCT__
thi year __PUNCT__ the appropri for that embassi wa nearli five billion dollar to oper it __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let sai __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ boo __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ let sai we need a project here at home __PUNCT__
why can't we cut that five billion dollar out __PUNCT__ forget about that embassi in baghdad __PUNCT__ that onli gonna lead to troubl __PUNCT__ take it and cut it in half __PUNCT__ take __NUM__ billion dollar off the deficit __PUNCT__ and spend it the __NUM__ billion dollar here __PUNCT__ back at home __PUNCT__ on project that we need __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ but there is no doubt that you can't have econom reform __PUNCT__ econom growth __PUNCT__ unless you look at the monetari polici __PUNCT__
financi bubbl ar caus for a reason __PUNCT__ and thei come from excess credit __PUNCT__ artifici low interest rate __PUNCT__ excess spend __PUNCT__ by the feder reserv system __PUNCT__
so if we want sound econom polici __PUNCT__ we have to address that subject __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ if we __PUNCT__ if we do all these thing __PUNCT__ we still have anoth major problem __PUNCT__
and that is the ultim respons of the govern __PUNCT__ the real purpos of the constitut __PUNCT__ the real purpos of what a republ is __PUNCT__ should be about __PUNCT__
it isn't to have welfar from cradl to grave __PUNCT__ it isn't for us to be the policemen of the world __PUNCT__ but the limit govern __PUNCT__ the govern that we should have in a constitut republ should be design to protect our liberti __PUNCT__ and noth els __PUNCT__
that should be the respons of the govern __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ ron paul __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ and thi __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ includ a strong nation defens __PUNCT__
but not an offens __PUNCT__
it should be a defens __PUNCT__ we should defend our countri as necessari __PUNCT__
if we go to war __PUNCT__ if the war have to be fought __PUNCT__ thei should be fought __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ get __PUNCT__ em over with __PUNCT__ get our troop back home as quickli as possibl __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ ron paul __PUNCT__ ron paul __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ but there ha been __PUNCT__ there ha been a steadi eros of person liberti in thi countri __PUNCT__ and that is what we have been so careless about __PUNCT__
but that been go on for a long time __PUNCT__
that what been especi bad in the last ten year or so __PUNCT__
9/11 help creat thi __PUNCT__
that wa a terribl __PUNCT__ terribl dai __PUNCT__ but i think that the assess wa wrong __PUNCT__
becaus the assess wa that it had someth to do with iraq __PUNCT__
and so therefor thei us 9/11 as an excus to go to iraq __PUNCT__ invad iraq __PUNCT__ fight a war there __PUNCT__ as well as __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ afghanistan __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ that wa not the caus __PUNCT__
al qaeda wa not in iraq __PUNCT__ and thei had no weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
and that attitud ha continu to thi veri dai __PUNCT__ becaus there ar a bunch of peopl up in washington __PUNCT__ and the other candid __PUNCT__ think that we can't wait __PUNCT__ till we go into syria and iran __PUNCT__
that make no sens __PUNCT__
we can't afford it __PUNCT__
it won't help it __PUNCT__ and it won't give us more defens __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ but we have been careless about the protect of our civil liberti __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ and thi is right after 9/11 __PUNCT__ thei pass a bill which wa absolut misnam __PUNCT__
thei call it the patriot act __PUNCT__ it should have been the unpatriot act __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ boo __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ and if the bill had been properli call the repeal of the fourth amend act __PUNCT__ it would have never been pass __PUNCT__ audienc __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ but it is the patriot act __PUNCT__
it allow our govern agent to invad our premis and our hous and invad our internet __PUNCT__ our email __PUNCT__ and whatev thei want to look at without a proper search warrant __PUNCT__
someth the founder explicitli fought a revolut on and put in the fourth amend __PUNCT__ the right of privaci __PUNCT__
todai we have it turn upsid __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__
we don't have privaci __PUNCT__ but we have too much secreci of govern __PUNCT__
we need much more open of govern __PUNCT__ and much more protect of our privaci __PUNCT__ as in the constitut __PUNCT__
audienc __PUNCT__ cheer __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ as frustrat as it might get at time __PUNCT__ we do have victori __PUNCT__
we had on here recent __PUNCT__ in the last month or so __PUNCT__ becaus there wa a bill float around __PUNCT__ stop onlin piraci act __PUNCT__
and thi wa an effort for the feder govern to take over and control the internet __PUNCT__
but a lot of peopl like you got word of it and sent a messag __PUNCT__
and washington __PUNCT__ even though it had major vote in both the hous and the senat __PUNCT__ onc thei heard from the peopl __PUNCT__ thei withdrew those bill __PUNCT__ thei took __PUNCT__ em off __PUNCT__ and thei ar no longer push through the congress __PUNCT__

audienc __PUNCT__ boo __PUNCT__ paul __PUNCT__ and to prove that point __PUNCT__ he now done it on three occas __PUNCT__
so that is __PUNCT__ that is a __PUNCT__ the law __PUNCT__ accord to the presid __PUNCT__
and when thei ask him about thi __PUNCT__ thei sai __PUNCT__ where doe it sai in the constitut that you can assassin an american citizen __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i can do anyth i want except those thing that ar explicitli deni to me in the constitut __PUNCT__ i think he ha that twist around a bit __PUNCT__

liberti will bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__
