we will be go to the caucu station __PUNCT__ state and we will be promot the whole idea of get more deleg __PUNCT__ becaus that the name of the game __PUNCT__
and we will pursu it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ twenti or __NUM__ year ago i start and i didn't think it __PUNCT__ that it would be well receiv __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ get elect __NUM__ time meant the peopl who knew me best vote for the caus of liberti and thi caus ha continu to grow __PUNCT__
even compar to four year ago __PUNCT__ it look like tonight we will get four to five time more vote than we did four year ago __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so there everi reason to be encourag __PUNCT__ there everi reason that we understand so clearli that the caus is so necessari __PUNCT__
thi is what i notic about four year ago __PUNCT__
after the last elect __PUNCT__ our effort were get __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ thei were get more and more attent __PUNCT__
and everybodi ask me __PUNCT__ the media fleet ask me __PUNCT__ what is differ __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the evid had becom clear that the effort by govern is fail __PUNCT__ and we can't depend on the govern to take care of us from cradl to grave __PUNCT__ we can't depend on the govern __PUNCT__ on it effort to promot and believ that we can polic the world and go into nation build becaus we all gone broke __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ we talk a lot about the economi and how we got into the mess and what we should do about it __PUNCT__
other have talk about it in glib term and not be specif but i see our problem as a spend problem govern is too big __PUNCT__
we do more thing __PUNCT__ all the thing we not suppos to do and we forget about do the thing we suppos to be do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so as a modest attempt to get back to reason budget __PUNCT__ we want to have a __MONEY__ trillion cut in spend in on year __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ there not __PUNCT__ there is on other littl item that i talk about __PUNCT__ not for thi campaign __PUNCT__ not for the last campaign __PUNCT__ but for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
as a matter of fact __PUNCT__ it motiv me in mani wai to run for congress __PUNCT__
and then it ha to do with how do we get awai with pai for these bill and endless spend occur and govern keep grow __PUNCT__
it cannot occur if you have a sound monetari system __PUNCT__
that why i have emphas the import of have a sound dollar and why we need to rein in the feder reserv system __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ on of the argument that thei __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ pose against us for talk about the gold standard is thei said it too complex and it riski busi __PUNCT__
but what is __PUNCT__ what can be more ridicul than sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ monei come out of a print press and it should be done in secret __PUNCT__ creat trillion of dollar and pass them out to the special interest and we suppos to accept that as a good monetari system __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ it isn't all that complex __PUNCT__
as a matter of fact __PUNCT__ if we obei the law we would have sound monei __PUNCT__
the constitut still sai that onli gold and silver should be legal tender __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ but if on understand thi __PUNCT__ you can understand why govern grow becaus politician don't have to be respons __PUNCT__
there variou reason why thei spend monei __PUNCT__ but if thei __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ to on degre thei can tax us but there a limit to how much __PUNCT__ becaus there will be a tax rebellion __PUNCT__
and thei can borrow and thei can get awai with that as long as the credit is good but eventu interest rate go up __PUNCT__
that why thei invent in __NUM__ thi financi system base on fiat monei and print monei __PUNCT__ becaus you can delai the pain and penalti __PUNCT__
and i us to sai __PUNCT__ so often __PUNCT__ over the year __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we run up these debt and we pass them on to the next gener __PUNCT__ we shouldn't do it __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ what differ todai __PUNCT__ we ar the next gener and we suffer the consequ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and thi is __PUNCT__ and thi is the reason that we cannot resolv the problem of the unfinanc entitl system __PUNCT__ social secur and all __PUNCT__ becaus if you just print monei __PUNCT__ the valu of monei goe down __PUNCT__ and the peopl standard go down __PUNCT__
alreadi the peopl on fix incom __PUNCT__ their standard of live is go down __PUNCT__
the middl class is shrink __PUNCT__
unemploy __PUNCT__ if you look at those honestli __PUNCT__ is closer to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ and the peopl ar veri __PUNCT__ veri concern about thi __PUNCT__
the answer come with a veri uncompl solut __PUNCT__
we got into thi mess by too mani peopl in washington either didn't care or didn't understand the constitut __PUNCT__
we need to restor the constitut __PUNCT__ and we must restor liberti __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ in order __PUNCT__ in order to do that __PUNCT__ we should spend all our resourc here at home __PUNCT__
that a good place to spend the monei __PUNCT__
thi is also the reason i have emphas so strongli about the wast and the amount of monei we spend oversea and the foreign aid __PUNCT__
at the same time our peopl ar suffer here at home __PUNCT__
so if we want to spend the monei __PUNCT__ we should work hard to return the monei from oversea spend to the peopl here in thi countri __PUNCT__ and thei should spend the monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ but in order to do thi __PUNCT__ we all know that it is not so simpl __PUNCT__
you don't wave a wand __PUNCT__
you have to chang the peopl attitud and that is what happen __PUNCT__
the peopl attitud ar chang and thei realiz that we can't afford thi ani longer __PUNCT__
even the peopl who ar on the receiv end know thei get into troubl becaus the produc have been push out of our countri __PUNCT__
so thi is becom the opportun for us to restor the valu that had made america great __PUNCT__
and it base on individu liberti __PUNCT__ it base on the concept that we ar free peopl with free spirit __PUNCT__ we should have control of our live and we should have a control of our destini __PUNCT__ but we also should have control of our monei as well __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ but thi will not be done __PUNCT__ govern doe reflect the prevail attitud of the peopl __PUNCT__
where we ar gain now is the prevail attitud of the peopl is chang __PUNCT__ and that is veri good becaus it __PUNCT__ s come our wai and sai govern is the problem __PUNCT__ it is not the solut __PUNCT__
we got into thi mess by too much spend and too much debt and too much print monei and too much regul __PUNCT__
how do thei think thei go to get out of thi mess by spend more monei __PUNCT__ print more monei __PUNCT__ borrow more monei and regul more __PUNCT__ it imposs __PUNCT__
that why we have to revers the cours __PUNCT__
foreign polici __PUNCT__ we need a foreign polici __PUNCT__ not so strang __PUNCT__ but on that the founder gave us __PUNCT__ on the constitut design __PUNCT__ on that is design to oper in our self __PUNCT__ interest and for our nation secur __PUNCT__
that what kind we have __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ i think a simpl littl thing to avoid go into these war that never seem to end __PUNCT__ that thei never seem to stop and we never know why we there and what the purpos is __PUNCT__
founder gave us the answer __PUNCT__
don't go to war unless the war is declar __PUNCT__
go to war __PUNCT__ win it and go home __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so that a good place to start __PUNCT__
bring the troop home and have them spend their monei here __PUNCT__ not oversea __PUNCT__
entitl system __PUNCT__ it doesn't work __PUNCT__
it all well intend __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ everybodi is go to get a hous __PUNCT__ and everybodi go to get free health care __PUNCT__ everybodi go to get a free educ __PUNCT__
and look at what we have __PUNCT__
all it doe is when you pump more monei into ani area __PUNCT__ you get higher price __PUNCT__
so the more the govern pump monei into educ or medicin __PUNCT__ the cost go up __PUNCT__ but you don't get higher qualiti or better distribut __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ our countri ha been veri lackadais __PUNCT__ and thi is what we reviv __PUNCT__ and that is we lackadais about our understand and our trust in freedom __PUNCT__
thi is what we need __PUNCT__
we need to restor the __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ that if we want a free and prosper societi __PUNCT__ we have to understand the necess of assum respons for ourselv __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the on other area that bother me significantli is when we accept the big role __PUNCT__ the role of big govern in econom or in oversea __PUNCT__ inevit it undermin our person liberti and it is __PUNCT__ and that is be attack now __PUNCT__ alwai with well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ good intent __PUNCT__ but in the last __NUM__ or __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we have embark in a __PUNCT__ on a road that is undermin our liberti __PUNCT__
when you think of the harm done and the threat to our privaci with the patriot act __PUNCT__ that ha liter cancel out the fourth amend __PUNCT__
we need to revers that and get rid of the patriot act __PUNCT__ is what i think we should do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ on place where __PUNCT__ when the peopl spoke out __PUNCT__ we achiev a lot __PUNCT__ and there is a few peopl in thi room i quit sure ar comput savvi and internet savvi __PUNCT__
and when thei threaten with sopa __PUNCT__ onlin gambl __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ an act which wa to take over the internet __PUNCT__ guess what __PUNCT__ you all spoke out and at least temporarili it ha been remov from the docket in washington in both the hous and the senat __PUNCT__
so that is an achiev __PUNCT__
when the peopl speak out __PUNCT__ can you get their attent in washington __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ but we also need to continu to speak out against what that paragraph thei put in the nation defens author act __PUNCT__ that provis that now allow our presid to us our militari to arrest american citizen with no charg and no attornei __PUNCT__
now i got a littl bit of critic from the media and i realli worri a lot about that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i took a dai thi week and went back up to washington __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that i wa on record to vote against increas the nation debt by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
but also while there __PUNCT__ i drop a piec of legisl in __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ is veri signific and i hope we gain the momentum becaus so mani peopl in the campaign ha been awar of thi __PUNCT__ although it not notic much in the mainstream media __PUNCT__ and that is i introduc a bill to repeal that provis and remov that power from our presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ our caus is the right caus __PUNCT__ becaus it the caus that made america great __PUNCT__
freedom is the answer to so mani of our problem __PUNCT__
if you think about divers in a countri as our countri is __PUNCT__ freedom bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__ becaus what we do is we releas the creativ energi of each individu __PUNCT__ to pursu their live as thei choos __PUNCT__ their lifestyl __PUNCT__ their religi valu __PUNCT__ their person valu will be determin by that individu as long as thei don't interfer with other __PUNCT__
thi bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__
econom it should be the same issu __PUNCT__ social issu and econom issu __PUNCT__
you should have not onli a right to your life and your own __PUNCT__ your own practic but you should have a right to spend your monei as you choos __PUNCT__
thi is what we have to do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and we did have the best experi ever __PUNCT__
we were the richest countri ever __PUNCT__
we had the largest middl class ever __PUNCT__ and now it is chang __PUNCT__
and it been systemat chang over quit a few decad __PUNCT__
