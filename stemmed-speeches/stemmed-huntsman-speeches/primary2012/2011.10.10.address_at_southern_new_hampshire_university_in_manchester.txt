a presid approach to foreign affair __PUNCT__ how he or she view the world __PUNCT__ and view america role on the world stage __PUNCT__ is perhap the most critic function of that sacr offic __PUNCT__
thi ha been true throughout our nation histori __PUNCT__ whether it wa truman in the dawn of the atom ag __PUNCT__ kennedi and the cuban missil crisi __PUNCT__ reagan and the soviet union __PUNCT__
but it ha never been more critic than todai __PUNCT__
we ar a nation mire in multipl militari engag oversea __PUNCT__ and in the grip of an econom crisi at home __PUNCT__
these ar tumultu time not just for our nation __PUNCT__ but all nation __PUNCT__
instabl in the middl east __PUNCT__ debt crise across europ __PUNCT__ the loom threat of nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__
the world need american leadership now more than ever __PUNCT__
yet we ar struggl to provid it __PUNCT__
presid obama polici have weaken america __PUNCT__ and thu diminish america presenc on the global stage __PUNCT__
we must correct our cours __PUNCT__
i live oversea four time __PUNCT__
i seen the world as a diplomat __PUNCT__ as a businessman __PUNCT__ as a humanitarian __PUNCT__
i live in and seen what our most signific competitor nation ar do to prepar for the rest of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and i have a veri clear vision of what america must do as well __PUNCT__
i believ the unit state ha a gener opportun to redefin it place in the world __PUNCT__ and reclaim the mantl of global leadership __PUNCT__
my administr approach to foreign affair will be guid by that which defin american exception __PUNCT__ and that is our valu __PUNCT__ liberti __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ human right __PUNCT__ free market __PUNCT__
america valu __PUNCT__ ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ ar america best gift to human __PUNCT__
to those nation who share our valu __PUNCT__ and who we call friend and alli __PUNCT__ we will restor trust and strengthen our bond __PUNCT__ both econom and militarili __PUNCT__
to those nation who continu to resist the unstopp march of human __PUNCT__ polit and econom freedom __PUNCT__ we will make clear that thei ar on the wrong side of histori __PUNCT__ by ensur that america light shine bright in everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__ repres a beacon of hope and inspir __PUNCT__
we will establish a foreign polici doctrin that reflect our modern world __PUNCT__
simpli advoc more ship __PUNCT__ more troop __PUNCT__ and more weapon is not a viabl path forward __PUNCT__
we need more agil __PUNCT__ more intellig __PUNCT__ and more econom engag with the world __PUNCT__
how will we do thi __PUNCT__ in short __PUNCT__ eras the old map __PUNCT__
end nation __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__ engag our alli __PUNCT__ and fix our core __PUNCT__
thi is how we will fight the enemi we have __PUNCT__ and renew american exception __PUNCT__
todai i like to discuss the five plank which will compris my administr foreign polici __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ first and foremost __PUNCT__ we must rebuild america core at thi critic junctur in histori __PUNCT__ our nation greatest challeng doe not eman from outsid our border __PUNCT__ but from within __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ million of our fellow american ar unemploi __PUNCT__ deni the digniti of a job __PUNCT__
million more ar so dispirit thei given up look __PUNCT__
our nation debt continu to streak toward unsustain level __PUNCT__
right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ in hillsborough counti __PUNCT__ sheriff jame hardi __PUNCT__ who ha serv for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ told me that for the first time ever __PUNCT__ hi folk ar hand out foreclosur notic to the middl class __PUNCT__
all thi is after trillion of dollar in govern spend and massiv bailout __PUNCT__
our nation core is weak __PUNCT__
our peopl ar hurt __PUNCT__
and america cannot project power abroad when we ar weak at home __PUNCT__
it increasingli evid that we lost leverag in the intern commun __PUNCT__
in just the last few week __PUNCT__ we saw the palestinian make an end __PUNCT__ run around the american __PUNCT__ led peac process __PUNCT__ becaus thei lost confid in it __PUNCT__ and in our abil to lead __PUNCT__
the world is a better place when america lead __PUNCT__
the world is a safer place when america lead __PUNCT__
and our interest ar best serv when america lead __PUNCT__
but to lead abroad __PUNCT__ we must regain strength at home __PUNCT__
return peopl to work __PUNCT__ reduc our debt __PUNCT__ restor confid in our __URL__ america first __PUNCT__ that will be my most urgent prioriti __PUNCT__
it will requir more than half __PUNCT__ measur __PUNCT__
it will requir seriou __PUNCT__ bold reform to our tax and regulatori system __PUNCT__ reform that i have offer as part of a plan that on economist call the most pro __PUNCT__ growth propos ever offer by a presidenti candid __PUNCT__
i will drop that plan on the front step of congress on dai on __PUNCT__ and will not stop fight until we get the job done __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ we need a foreign polici of expans __PUNCT__ not contain strengthen our core mean dramat overhaul of our tax and regulatori code __PUNCT__
it also mean empow american entrepreneur to compet in the global marketplac __PUNCT__ and sell their product to custom around the world __PUNCT__
america onc had a foreign polici base on contain __PUNCT__ the contain of commun __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we need a foreign polici base on expans __PUNCT__ the expans of america competit and engag in the world through partnership and trade agreement __PUNCT__
free trade support nearli __NUM__ million american job __PUNCT__ and establish new line of trade with intern partner repres an enorm well of untap econom and polit goodwil __PUNCT__
__NUM__ percent of the world custom live outsid our border __PUNCT__ yet the unit state is parti to onli __NUM__ of the more than __NUM__ trade agreement worldwid __PUNCT__
we will particularli seek greater trade opportun with nation that share our valu __PUNCT__ that believ in good govern __PUNCT__ open market and rule of law __PUNCT__ as well as nation will to engag in reform effort toward those end __PUNCT__
it start with pass the three pend trade deal with south korea __PUNCT__ colombia and panama __PUNCT__ which presid obama ha resist for three year __PUNCT__ and which could boost american export by more than __MONEY__ billion and creat ten of thousand of american job __PUNCT__
we should aggress push for the conclus of the tran __PUNCT__ pacif partnership __PUNCT__ which will open market in australia __PUNCT__ brunei __PUNCT__ chile __PUNCT__ malaysia __PUNCT__ new zealand __PUNCT__ peru __PUNCT__ singapor and vietnam __PUNCT__
we should pursu trade agreement with japan and taiwan __PUNCT__
we need to pursu free trade agreement as aggress as china __PUNCT__
china is in the game __PUNCT__
we ar not __PUNCT__
america must also support the doha develop round of wto negoti __PUNCT__ aim at promot trade between develop and develop nation __PUNCT__
thi is an opportun for the unstopp tide of econom advanc to lift all ship __PUNCT__ and it fall to america to lead thi effort __PUNCT__
energi independ is anoth critic piec of not onli our foreign polici __PUNCT__ but our econom polici __PUNCT__
everi year america send more than __MONEY__ billion oversea for import oil __PUNCT__ much of it to the middl east __PUNCT__
i offer a comprehens plan to free ourselv from opec grasp by reli more on domest suppli of oil and ga __PUNCT__ to the benefit of our nation and econom secur __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ we must right __PUNCT__ size our current foreign entangl simpli put __PUNCT__ we ar risk american blood and treasur in part of the world where our strategi need to be rethought __PUNCT__
afghanistan wa onc the center of the terrorist threat to america __PUNCT__
that is no longer the case __PUNCT__
the soviet were there for nine year befor thei left with over __NUM__ dead __PUNCT__
thei tri to crush the afghan with pure power __PUNCT__ aerial bomb and strafe and helicopt gunship and tank __PUNCT__
we have been there ten year and ar take a differ approach __PUNCT__
we ar nation build __PUNCT__
our presenc there should not focu on nation build __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ but rather on counterterror __PUNCT__
we cannot social engin other countri __PUNCT__
we can't even social engin our own inner citi __PUNCT__
it is cultur arrog to think we can make tribal leader into democrat leader __PUNCT__
it is wish think to believ that our troop __PUNCT__ by stai for a coupl more year __PUNCT__ will prevent further instabl or even civil war __PUNCT__
our men and women in uniform have done their all __PUNCT__ given their all __PUNCT__ in afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__
thei rout the taliban and crippl al __PUNCT__ qaeda and other terrorist network __PUNCT__
thei have taken the fight abroad so we didn't have to face it here at home __PUNCT__
our nation ha done it duti __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ live lost and more than __MONEY__ trillion spent __PUNCT__ it is time to bring our brave troop home __PUNCT__
and as thei return __PUNCT__ we will take care of them __PUNCT__ and help our veteran transit from the battlefront to the homefront __PUNCT__
we could go from __NUM__ boot on the ground to a much smaller footprint in a year __PUNCT__ while leav behind an adequ number of counterterrorist and intellig function and a facil special forc presenc __PUNCT__
and i believ we should __PUNCT__
as for the argument that our exit will destabil pakistan __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ onli pakistan can save pakistan __PUNCT__
onli afghanistan can save afghanistan __PUNCT__
and right now we should focu on america save america __PUNCT__
our futur is not in the hindu kush mountain of afghanistan __PUNCT__
it is in school and univers just like thi on __PUNCT__ which educ our leader and entrepreneur of tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is in silicon vallei __PUNCT__
it is in the industri corridor of the midwest __PUNCT__
it is in our farm and factori __PUNCT__ and our port that ship our product to the world __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__
pakistan __PUNCT__ which possess a demonstr nuclear weapon capabl and a fractur militari that sponsor terror __PUNCT__ doe demand u. __PUNCT__ attent __PUNCT__
yet we must acknowledg certain realiti as we consid the wisest wai forward __PUNCT__
thi is not a relationship base on share valu __PUNCT__
it is transact at best __PUNCT__
mani american ar rightli suspici of islamabad in the wake of the bin laden oper __PUNCT__
likewis __PUNCT__ despit billion of dollar in aid __PUNCT__ the unit state is held in veri low regard throughout the countri __PUNCT__
we cannot dictat fundament chang upon an ag __PUNCT__ old civil from afar __PUNCT__
but make no mistak __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will protect american secur interest in pakistan without be naiv about islamabad incent and long __PUNCT__ term interest __PUNCT__
there is anoth advantag to a more judici approach toward foreign entangl __PUNCT__
it help prevent our militari from be stretch too thin __PUNCT__ and unabl to effect respond to a direct secur threat __PUNCT__ either to america __PUNCT__ or on of our alli __PUNCT__
thi includ stand shoulder to shoulder with israel as thei manag a host of new challeng brought on by the arab spring __PUNCT__ along with more familiar challeng __PUNCT__ such as a hostil iran __PUNCT__ which will continu to be a transcend challeng of the next decad __PUNCT__
i cannot live with a nuclear __PUNCT__ arm iran __PUNCT__
if you want an exampl of when i would consid the us of american forc __PUNCT__ it would be that __PUNCT__
a reexamin of america role in the world also requir a reexamin of our militari and defens infrastructur __PUNCT__
it mai surpris some peopl to learn that we spend more on defens todai than at the height of the cold war __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ we spend more on defens than the rest of the world combin __PUNCT__
we still have remnant of a top __PUNCT__ heavi __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ cold war infrastructur __PUNCT__
it need to be transform to reflect the __NUM__ centuri world __PUNCT__ and the grow asymmetr threat we face __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ counterterror need to be a much larger part of our foreign polici __PUNCT__
we must be prepar to respond to threat __PUNCT__ from al qaeda and other terrorist cell __PUNCT__ that eman from a much more divers geographi __PUNCT__ includ yemen __PUNCT__ the horn of africa __PUNCT__ pakistan and the asia __PUNCT__ pacif __PUNCT__
we must also adapt our defens to evolv mean of attack __PUNCT__
thi mean a greater focu on intellig gather and more agil special forc unit __PUNCT__ which can respond swiftli and firmli to terrorist threat in ani corner of the globe __PUNCT__
the tradit role and mission of our arm forc will remain relev for the forese futur __PUNCT__ but the rel import of counter __PUNCT__ terror __PUNCT__ intellig gather train and equip foreign secur forc __PUNCT__ and special forc oper will continu to grow go forward __PUNCT__
we must also transform our orient __PUNCT__
i have come to believ that we ar embark on a pacif centuri __PUNCT__ in which america must and will plai a domin role __PUNCT__
by almost ani object measur __PUNCT__ popul __PUNCT__ econom power __PUNCT__ militari might __PUNCT__ energi us __PUNCT__ the center of graviti of global human activ is move toward the asia __PUNCT__ pacif region __PUNCT__
embrac thi realiti mai bring a dramat chang to the look of our militari __PUNCT__
the asia pacif is a maritim theater wherea europ wa mostli a land theater __PUNCT__
for the u. __PUNCT__ the asia __PUNCT__ pacif featur a collect of bilater militari allianc in contrast to the presenc of nato in europ __PUNCT__
and the asia __PUNCT__ pacif is full of disput island and resourc claim when compar to the rel calm of other region __PUNCT__
we ar a pacif nation __PUNCT__ and our vital interest in that region cannot be compromis __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ we must strengthen our relationship with major power our tradit allianc relationship with europ remain vital to american secur __PUNCT__ and we should also work close with our friend in nato and the european union to bring russia __PUNCT__ a sometim difficult actor __PUNCT__ closer to the west __PUNCT__
but i believ that the reemerg of two ancient land __PUNCT__ china and india __PUNCT__ will most influenc how america navig the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ china __PUNCT__
there is no other relationship that __PUNCT__ if mismanag __PUNCT__ carri greater neg consequ for america and the world __PUNCT__
altern __PUNCT__ wise stewardship of the u.s. __PUNCT__ china relationship will make america and our alli safer and more prosper __PUNCT__
the stake ar enorm __PUNCT__ as ar the challeng and opportun __PUNCT__
natur __PUNCT__ we will disagre often __PUNCT__ whether over taiwan secur need __PUNCT__ human right __PUNCT__ or the protect of intellectu properti right __PUNCT__
while avoid a trade war __PUNCT__ we must also press china to open it market to our export and increas intern demand __PUNCT__ so china growth is not at the expens of our worker __PUNCT__
yet a fundament question is __PUNCT__ will we also find area of cooper __PUNCT__ our relationship with china ha been a transact on for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we bui their product __PUNCT__
thei bui our bond __PUNCT__
but for a truli healthi relationship __PUNCT__ we need to infus the relationship with share valu __PUNCT__
until that time __PUNCT__ we should begin to build a broader and more cooper agenda __PUNCT__
the unit state and china can and should todai start collabor on clean energi technolog __PUNCT__ combat global pandem __PUNCT__ and counter piraci on the high sea __PUNCT__
we must also strengthen our relationship with india __PUNCT__ a countri that share our valu __PUNCT__ religi toler __PUNCT__ respect for human right __PUNCT__ and a commit to democraci __PUNCT__
we must begin with negoti to reach an eventu trade agreement __PUNCT__ creat hundr of million of addit consum for american product __PUNCT__
but our relationship with india need to go beyond econom __PUNCT__
the arc of countri that lie along the indian ocean border some of the most import energi and trade lane in the world __PUNCT__
those lane ar critic for the free flow of commerc __PUNCT__ and remain vulner to threat small and larg __PUNCT__
to that end __PUNCT__ i welcom the indian navi transform into a blue water navi __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will increas our militari and diplomat cooper with india __PUNCT__ with the expect that thei share respons in maintain peac and secur in thi vital region __PUNCT__
and recogn india emerg role __PUNCT__ i will also support our alli bid to becom a perman member of the u.n __PUNCT__ secur council __PUNCT__ as is fit a countri repres on __PUNCT__ sixth of human __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ we must take care of our own neighborhood for too long the unit state ha neglect it commit to the countri in our backyard __PUNCT__ the western hemispher __PUNCT__
the result is lost opportun __PUNCT__ strain relat and escal secur challeng __PUNCT__
latin america is not onli a neighbor with whom we share a rich histori __PUNCT__ it is also a major sourc of untap econom opportun __PUNCT__
the u. __PUNCT__ export three time as much to latin america as we do to china __PUNCT__
but mani nation in our hemispher ar experienc a terrifi surg in violenc that threaten to disrupt thi progress __PUNCT__
the wave of bloodsh that ha swept over mexico __PUNCT__ the result of corrupt and collus with drug cartel __PUNCT__ ha left __NUM__ peopl dead __PUNCT__ creat casualti even insid america border __PUNCT__
mexico stand readi to work with the u. __PUNCT__ in combat the drug war __PUNCT__ and we should commit to continu cooper __PUNCT__ includ enhanc militari __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ militari engag __PUNCT__
