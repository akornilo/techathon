you see todai american ar experienc __PUNCT__ through no fault of their own __PUNCT__ someth that is total alien to them __PUNCT__ a sens that the deck is stack against them by forc total beyond their control __PUNCT__
no matter how hard thei work __PUNCT__ save __PUNCT__ and plan __PUNCT__ the opportun ar not there for them as that were present for previou gener __PUNCT__
perhap __PUNCT__ saddest of all __PUNCT__ we have lost faith in ourselv __PUNCT__
for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ we ar pass down to the next gener a countri that is less power __PUNCT__ less compassion __PUNCT__ less competit and less confid than the on we got __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ ladi and gentlemen __PUNCT__ is total unaccept and it is total un __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__
and it need not __PUNCT__ must not __PUNCT__ will not be our perman condit __PUNCT__
we will not be the first american gener that let down the next gener __PUNCT__

what we now need is leadership that trust in our strength __PUNCT__
leadership that doesn't promis washington ha all of the solut to our problem __PUNCT__ but rather look to local solut from our citi __PUNCT__ town and state __PUNCT__
leadership that know we need more than hope __PUNCT__ leadership that know we need answer __PUNCT__
we must make hard decis that ar necessari to avert disast __PUNCT__
if we don't __PUNCT__ in less than a decad __PUNCT__ everi dollar of feder revenu will go to cover the cost of medicar __PUNCT__ social secur and interest payment on our debt __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ we sink deeper into debt for everyth els __PUNCT__ from nation secur to disast relief __PUNCT__
our countri will fall behind the product of other countri __PUNCT__
our influenc in the world will wane __PUNCT__
our secur will grow ever more precari __PUNCT__
and the __NUM__ centuri will then be known as the end of the american centuri __PUNCT__
we can't accept thi __PUNCT__ and we won't __PUNCT__
but here is the challeng __PUNCT__
we must proce at a time of weak econom growth and veri high unemploy __PUNCT__
we desper need job and the opportun thei carri __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ we must plai to our strength __PUNCT__ and give the most innov societi on earth the tool thei need to succe __PUNCT__
we must make broad and bold chang to our tax code and regulatori polici __PUNCT__ seiz the lost opportun of energi independ and reestablish what it mean to be a teacher in societi __PUNCT__
we must reignit the power job creat engin of our economi __PUNCT__ the industri __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ reliabl __PUNCT__ and trailblaz geniu of american and their enterpris __PUNCT__ and restor confid in our peopl __PUNCT__
