i want to speak plainli thi morn about the opportun and the danger we face todai in the middl east __PUNCT__
the revolut now roil that region offer the promis of a more democrat __PUNCT__ more open __PUNCT__ and a more prosper arab world __PUNCT__
from morocco to the arabian gulf __PUNCT__ the escap from the dead hand of oppress is now a real possibl __PUNCT__
now is not the time to retreat from freedom rise __PUNCT__
yet at the same time __PUNCT__ we know these revolut can bring to power forc that ar neither democrat nor forward __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__
just as the peopl of egypt __PUNCT__ tunisia __PUNCT__ libya __PUNCT__ syria and elsewher see a chanc for a better life of genuin freedom __PUNCT__ the leader of radic islam see a chanc to ride polit turmoil into power __PUNCT__
the unit state ha a vital stake in the futur of thi region __PUNCT__
we have been present with a challeng as great as ani we have face in recent decad __PUNCT__
and we must get it right __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ ar we up to the challeng __PUNCT__ my answer is __PUNCT__ of cours we ar __PUNCT__
if we ar clear about our interest and guid by our principl __PUNCT__ we can help steer event in the right direct __PUNCT__
our nation ha done thi in the past __PUNCT__ at the end of world war ii __PUNCT__ in the last decad of the cold war __PUNCT__ and in the more recent war on terror __PUNCT__ and we can do it again __PUNCT__
but presid obama ha fail to formul and carri out an effect and coher strategi in respons to these event __PUNCT__
he ha been timid __PUNCT__ slow __PUNCT__ and too often without a clear understand of our interest or a clear commit to our principl __PUNCT__
and part of the republican parti now seem to be try to out __PUNCT__ bid the democrat in appeal to isolationist sentiment __PUNCT__
thi is no time for uncertain leadership in either parti __PUNCT__
the stake ar simpli too high __PUNCT__ and the opportun is simpli too great __PUNCT__
no on in thi administr predict the event of the arab spring __PUNCT__ but the freedom deficit in the arab world wa no secret __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ western nation excus and accommod the lack of freedom in the middl east __PUNCT__
that could not last __PUNCT__
the dai of comfort privat deal with dictat were come to an end in the ag of twitter __PUNCT__ you tube __PUNCT__ and facebook __PUNCT__
and histori teach there is no such thing as stabl oppress __PUNCT__
presid obama ha ignor that lesson of histori __PUNCT__
instead of promot democraci __PUNCT__ whose fruit we see now ripen across the region __PUNCT__ he adopt a murki polici he call __PUNCT__ engag __PUNCT__ engag __PUNCT__ meant that in __NUM__ when the iranian ayatollah stole an elect __PUNCT__ and the peopl of that countri rose up in protest __PUNCT__ presid obama held hi tongu __PUNCT__
hi silenc valid the mullah __PUNCT__ despit the blood on their hand and the nuclear centrifug in their tunnel __PUNCT__
while protest were kill and tortur __PUNCT__ secretari clinton said the administr wa __PUNCT__ wait to see the outcom of the intern iranian process __PUNCT__ she and the presid wait long enough to see the green movement crush __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ engag __PUNCT__ meant that in hi first year in offic __PUNCT__ presid obama cut democraci fund for egyptian civil societi by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
as on american democraci organ note __PUNCT__ thi wa __PUNCT__ perceiv by egyptian democraci activist as signal a lack of support __PUNCT__ thei perceiv correctli __PUNCT__
it wa a lack of support __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ engag __PUNCT__ meant that when crisi erupt in cairo thi year __PUNCT__ as ten of thousand of protest gather in tahrir squar __PUNCT__ secretari clinton declar __PUNCT__ the egyptian govern is stabl __PUNCT__ two week later __PUNCT__ mubarak wa gone __PUNCT__
when secretari clinton visit cairo after mubarak fall __PUNCT__ democrat activist group refus to meet with her __PUNCT__
and who can blame them __PUNCT__ the forc we now need to succe in egypt __PUNCT__ the pro __PUNCT__ democraci __PUNCT__ secular polit parti __PUNCT__ these ar the veri peopl presid obama cut off __PUNCT__ and secretari clinton dismiss __PUNCT__
the obama __PUNCT__ engag __PUNCT__ polici in syria led the administr to call bashar al assad a __PUNCT__ reform __PUNCT__ even as assad regim wa shoot hundr of protest dead in the street __PUNCT__ presid obama announc hi plan to give assad __PUNCT__ an altern vision of himself __PUNCT__ doe anyon outsid a therapist offic have ani idea what that mean __PUNCT__ thi is what pass for moral clariti in the obama administr __PUNCT__
by contrast __PUNCT__ i call for assad departur on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i call for it again todai __PUNCT__
we should recal our ambassador from damascu __PUNCT__ and i call for that again todai __PUNCT__
the leader of the unit state should never leav those will to sacrific their live in the caus of freedom wonder where america stand __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will not __PUNCT__
we need a presid who fulli understand that america never __PUNCT__ lead from behind __PUNCT__ we cannot underestim how pivot thi moment is in middl eastern histori __PUNCT__
we need decis __PUNCT__ clear __PUNCT__ ei leadership that is respons to thi histor moment of chang in wai that ar consist with our deepest principl and safeguard our vital interest __PUNCT__
opportun still exist amid the turmoil of the arab spring __PUNCT__ and we should seiz it __PUNCT__
as i see it __PUNCT__ the govern of the middl east fall into four broad categori __PUNCT__ and each requir a differ strateg approach __PUNCT__
the first categori consist of three countri now at variou stage of transit toward democraci __PUNCT__ the formerli fake republ in egypt __PUNCT__ tunisia __PUNCT__ and libya __PUNCT__
iraq is also in thi categori __PUNCT__ but is further along on it journei toward democraci __PUNCT__
for these countri __PUNCT__ our goal should be to help promot freedom and democraci __PUNCT__
elect that produc anti __PUNCT__ democrat regim undermin both freedom and stabil __PUNCT__
we must do more than monitor poll place __PUNCT__
we must redirect foreign aid awai from effort to mere build good will __PUNCT__ and toward effort to build good alli __PUNCT__ genuin democraci govern by free peopl accord to the rule of law __PUNCT__
and we must insist that our intern partner get off the sidelin and do the same __PUNCT__
we should have no illus about the difficulti of the transit face by libya __PUNCT__ tunisia __PUNCT__ and especi egypt __PUNCT__
wherea libya is rich in oil __PUNCT__ and tunisia is small __PUNCT__ egypt is larg __PUNCT__ popul __PUNCT__ and poor __PUNCT__
among the region emerg democraci __PUNCT__ it remain the biggest opportun and the biggest danger for american interest __PUNCT__
have eject the mubarak regim __PUNCT__ too mani egyptian ar now reject the begin of the econom open engin in the last decad __PUNCT__
we act out of friendship when we tell egyptian __PUNCT__ and everi new democraci __PUNCT__ that econom growth and prosper ar the result of free market and free trade __PUNCT__ not subsidi and foreign aid __PUNCT__
if we want these countri to succe __PUNCT__ we must afford them the respect of tell them the truth __PUNCT__
in libya __PUNCT__ the best help america can provid to these new friend is to stop lead from behind and commit america strength to remov ghadafi __PUNCT__ recogn the tnc as the govern of libya __PUNCT__ and unfreez asset so the tnc can afford secur and essenti servic as it march toward tripoli __PUNCT__
beyond libya __PUNCT__ america should alwai promot the univers principl that undergird freedom __PUNCT__
we should press new friend to end discrimin against women __PUNCT__ to establish independ court __PUNCT__ and freedom of speech and the press __PUNCT__
we must insist on religi freedom for all __PUNCT__ includ the region minor __PUNCT__ whether christian __PUNCT__ shia __PUNCT__ sunni __PUNCT__ or bahai __PUNCT__
the second categori of state is the arab monarchi __PUNCT__
some __PUNCT__ like jordan and morocco __PUNCT__ ar engag now in what look like genuin reform __PUNCT__
thi should earn our prais and our assist __PUNCT__
these king have understood thei must forg a partnership with their own peopl __PUNCT__ lead step by step toward more democrat societi __PUNCT__
these monarchi can smooth the path to constitut reform and freedom and therebi deepen their own legitimaci __PUNCT__
if thei choos thi rout __PUNCT__ thei __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ deserv our help __PUNCT__
but other ar resist reform __PUNCT__
while presid obama spoke well about bahrain in hi recent speech __PUNCT__ he neglect to utter two import word __PUNCT__ saudi arabia __PUNCT__
us __PUNCT__ saudi relat ar at an all __PUNCT__ time low __PUNCT__ and not primarili becaus of the arab spring __PUNCT__
thei were go downhil fast __PUNCT__ long befor the upris began __PUNCT__
the saudi saw an american administr yearn to engag iran __PUNCT__ just at the time thei saw iran __PUNCT__ correctli __PUNCT__ as a mortal enemi __PUNCT__
we need to tell the saudi what we think __PUNCT__ which will onli be effect if we have a posit of trust with them __PUNCT__
we will develop that trust by demonstr that we share their great concern about iran and that we ar commit to do all that is necessari to defend the region from iranian aggress __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we need to be frank about what the saudi must do to insur stabil in their own countri __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ thei need to reform and open their societi __PUNCT__
their treatment of christian and other minor __PUNCT__ and their treatment of women __PUNCT__ is indefens and must chang __PUNCT__
we know that reform will come to saudi arabia __PUNCT__ sooner and more smoothli if the royal famili accept and design it __PUNCT__
it will come later and with turbul and even violenc if thei resist __PUNCT__
the vast wealth of their countri should be us to support reform that fit saudi histori and cultur __PUNCT__ but not to bui off the peopl as a substitut for last reform __PUNCT__
the third categori consist of state that ar directli hostil to america __PUNCT__
thei includ iran and syria __PUNCT__
the arab spring ha alreadi vastli undermin the appeal of al qaeda and the kill of osama bin laden ha significantli weaken it __PUNCT__
the success of peac protest in sever arab countri ha shown the world that terror is not onli evil __PUNCT__ but will eventu be overcom by good __PUNCT__
peac protest mai soon bring down the assad regim in syria __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ protest in iran inspir arab to seek their freedom __PUNCT__
similarli __PUNCT__ the arab protest of thi year __PUNCT__ and the fall of regim after broken regim __PUNCT__ can inspir iranian to seek their freedom onc again __PUNCT__
we have a clear interest in see an end to assad murder regim __PUNCT__
by stick to bashar al assad so long __PUNCT__ the obama administr ha not onli frustrat syrian who ar fight for freedom __PUNCT__ it ha demonstr strateg blind __PUNCT__
the govern of iran and syria ar enemi of the unit state __PUNCT__
thei ar not reform and never will be __PUNCT__
thei support each other __PUNCT__
to weaken or replac on __PUNCT__ is to weaken or replac the other __PUNCT__
the fall of the assad mafia in damascu would weaken hama __PUNCT__ which is headquart there __PUNCT__
it would weaken hezbollah __PUNCT__ which get it arm from iran __PUNCT__ through syria __PUNCT__
and it would weaken the iranian regim itself __PUNCT__
to take advantag of thi moment __PUNCT__ we should press everi diplomat and econom channel to bring the assad reign of terror to an end __PUNCT__
we need more forc sanction to persuad syria sunni busi elit that assad is too expens to keep back __PUNCT__
we need to work with turkei and the arab nation and the european __PUNCT__ to further isol the regim __PUNCT__
and we need to encourag oppon of the regim by make our own posit veri clear __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ bashar al __PUNCT__ assad must go __PUNCT__
when he doe __PUNCT__ the mullah of iran will find themselv isol and vulner __PUNCT__
syria is iran onli arab alli __PUNCT__
if we peel that awai __PUNCT__ i believ it will hasten the fall of the mullah __PUNCT__
and that is the ultim goal we must pursu __PUNCT__
it the singular opportun offer to the world by the brave men and women of the arab spring __PUNCT__
the march of freedom in the middl east cut across the region divers of religi __PUNCT__ ethnic __PUNCT__ and polit group __PUNCT__
but it is born of a particular uniti __PUNCT__
it is a unit front against stolen elect and stolen liberti __PUNCT__ secret polic __PUNCT__ corrupt __PUNCT__ and the state __PUNCT__ sanction violenc that is the essenc of the iranian regim tyranni __PUNCT__
so thi is a moment to ratchet up pressur and speak with clariti __PUNCT__
more sanction __PUNCT__
more and better broadcast into iran __PUNCT__
more assist to iranian to access the internet and satellit tv and the knowledg and freedom that come with it __PUNCT__
more effort to expos the viciou repress insid that countri and expos teheran regim for the pariah it is __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ veri critic __PUNCT__ we must have more clariti when it come to iran nuclear program __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ candid barack obama told aipac that he would __PUNCT__ alwai keep the threat of militari action on the tabl to defend our secur and our alli israel __PUNCT__ thi year __PUNCT__ he told aipac __PUNCT__ we remain commit to prevent iran from acquir nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ so i have to ask __PUNCT__ ar all the option still on the tabl or not __PUNCT__ if he not clear with us __PUNCT__ it no wonder that even our closest alli ar confus __PUNCT__
the administr should enforc all sanction for which legal author alreadi exit __PUNCT__
we should enact and then enforc new pend legisl which strengthen sanction particularli against the iranian revolutionari guard who control much of the iranian economi __PUNCT__
and in the middl of all thi __PUNCT__ is israel __PUNCT__
israel is uniqu in the region becaus of what it stand for and what it ha accomplish __PUNCT__
and it is uniqu in the threat it face __PUNCT__ the threat of annihil __PUNCT__
it ha long been a bastion of democraci in a region of tyranni and violenc __PUNCT__
and it is by far our closest alli in that part of the world __PUNCT__
despit war and terrorist attack __PUNCT__ israel offer all it citizen __PUNCT__ men and women __PUNCT__ jew __PUNCT__ christian __PUNCT__ muslim and __PUNCT__ other includ __NUM__ million arab __PUNCT__ freedom of religion __PUNCT__ freedom of speech __PUNCT__ the right to vote __PUNCT__ access to independ court and all other democrat right __PUNCT__
nowher ha presid obama lack of judgment been more stun than in hi deal with israel __PUNCT__
it break my heart that presid obama treat israel __PUNCT__ our great friend __PUNCT__ as a problem __PUNCT__ rather than as an alli __PUNCT__
the presid seem to genuin believ the isra __PUNCT__ palestinian conflict li at the heart of everi problem in the middl east __PUNCT__
he said it cairo in __NUM__ and again thi year __PUNCT__
presid obama could not be more wrong __PUNCT__
the upris in tuni __PUNCT__ cairo __PUNCT__ tripoli and elsewher ar not about isra and palestinian __PUNCT__
thei about oppress peopl yearn for freedom and prosper __PUNCT__
whether those countri becom prosper and free is not about how mani apart israel build in jerusalem __PUNCT__
todai the presid doesn't realli have a polici toward the peac process __PUNCT__
he ha an attitud __PUNCT__
and let be frank about what that attitud is __PUNCT__ he think israel is the problem __PUNCT__
and he think the answer is alwai more pressur on israel __PUNCT__
i reject that anti __PUNCT__ israel attitud __PUNCT__
i reject it becaus israel is a close and reliabl democrat alli __PUNCT__
and i reject it becaus i know the peopl of israel want peac __PUNCT__
isra __PUNCT__ palestinian peac is further awai now than the dai barack obama came to offic __PUNCT__
but that doe not have to be a perman situat __PUNCT__
we must recogn that peac will onli come if everyon in the region perceiv clearli that america stand strongli with israel __PUNCT__
i would take a new approach __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i would never undermin israel negoti posit __PUNCT__ nor pressur it to accept border which jeopard secur and it abil to defend itself __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i would not pressur israel to negoti with hama or a palestinian govern that includ hama __PUNCT__ unless hama renounc terror __PUNCT__ accept israel right to exist __PUNCT__ and honor the previou isra __PUNCT__ palestinian agreement __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ hama need to ceas be a terrorist group in both word and deed as a first step toward global legitimaci __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i would ensur our assist to the palestinian immedi end if the teach of hatr in palestinian classroom and airwav continu __PUNCT__
that incit must end now __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ i would recommend cultiv and empow moder forc in palestinian societi __PUNCT__
when the palestinian have leader who ar honest and capabl __PUNCT__ who appreci the rule of law __PUNCT__ who understand that war against israel ha doom gener of palestinian to live of bitter __PUNCT__ violenc __PUNCT__ and poverti __PUNCT__ then peac will come __PUNCT__
the middl east is chang befor our ey __PUNCT__ but our govern ha not kept up __PUNCT__
it abandon the promot of democraci just as arab were about to seiz it __PUNCT__
it sought to cozi up to dictat just as their own peopl rose against them __PUNCT__
it downplai our principl and distanc us from kei alli __PUNCT__
all thi wa wrong __PUNCT__ and these polici have fail __PUNCT__
the administr ha abandon them __PUNCT__ and at the price of american leadership __PUNCT__
a region that sinc world war ii ha look to us for secur and progress now wonder where we ar and what we up to __PUNCT__
the next presid must do better __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ in our own republican parti __PUNCT__ some look back and conclud our project of strength and defens of freedom wa a product of differ time and differ challeng __PUNCT__
while time have chang __PUNCT__ the natur of the challeng ha not __PUNCT__
in the 1980 __PUNCT__ we were up against a violent __PUNCT__ totalitarian ideolog bent on subjug the peopl and principl of the west __PUNCT__
while other sought to co __PUNCT__ exist __PUNCT__ presid reagan instead sought victori __PUNCT__
so must we __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__
for america is except __PUNCT__ and we have the moral clariti to lead the world __PUNCT__
it is not wrong for republican to question the conduct of presid obama militari leadership in libya __PUNCT__
there is much to question __PUNCT__
and it is not wrong for republican to debat the time of our militari drawdown in afghanistan __PUNCT__ though my belief is that gener petraeu __PUNCT__ voic ought to carri the most weight on that question __PUNCT__
what is wrong __PUNCT__ is for the republican parti to shrink from the challeng of american leadership in the world __PUNCT__
histori repeatedli warn us that in the long run __PUNCT__ weak in foreign polici cost us and our children much more than we save in a budget line item __PUNCT__
america alreadi ha on polit parti devot to declin __PUNCT__ retrench __PUNCT__ and withdraw __PUNCT__
it doe not need a second on __PUNCT__
our enemi in the war on terror __PUNCT__ just like our oppon in the cold war __PUNCT__ respect and respond to strength __PUNCT__
sometim strength mean militari intervent __PUNCT__
sometim it mean diplomat pressur __PUNCT__
it alwai mean moral clariti in word and deed __PUNCT__
that is the legaci of republican foreign polici at it best __PUNCT__ and the banner our next republican presid must carri around the world __PUNCT__
our ideal of econom and polit freedom __PUNCT__ of equal and opportun for all citizen __PUNCT__ remain the dream of peopl in the middl east and throughout the world __PUNCT__
as america stand for these principl __PUNCT__ and stand with our friend and alli __PUNCT__ we will help the middl east transform thi moment of turbul into a firmer __PUNCT__ more last opportun for freedom __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ and progress __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
