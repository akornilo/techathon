i tim pawlenti __PUNCT__ and i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we live in the greatest countri the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ as we all know __PUNCT__ america is in big troubl __PUNCT__ and it won't get fix if we keep go down the same path __PUNCT__
if we want a new and better direct __PUNCT__ we need a new and better presid __PUNCT__
presid obama polici have fail __PUNCT__
but more than that __PUNCT__ he won't even tell us the truth about what it realli go to take to get out of the mess we in __PUNCT__
i could stand here and tell you that we can solv america debt crisi and fix our economi without make ani tough choic __PUNCT__
but we heard those kind of empti promis for the last three year __PUNCT__ and we know where thei gotten us __PUNCT__

presid obama doesn't have an econom plan __PUNCT__
he just ha a campaign plan __PUNCT__
america deserv much better __PUNCT__
barack obama promis that spend eight hundr billion dollar on a pork __PUNCT__ fill stimulu bill would keep unemploy under eight percent __PUNCT__
he promis that bailout for well __PUNCT__ connect busi were a good deal for the countri __PUNCT__
he promis that a feder takeov of health care would keep cost under control __PUNCT__
and hard as it is to believ __PUNCT__ he even promis the deficit would be cut in half in hi first term __PUNCT__ but the truth is __PUNCT__ sinc presid obama took offic __PUNCT__ massiv number of american can't find a job __PUNCT__
we four trillion dollar deeper in debt __PUNCT__
and hi health care plan is an unmitig disast for our countri __PUNCT__
we tri barack obama wai __PUNCT__ and hi wai ha fail __PUNCT__
three year into hi term __PUNCT__ we no longer just run out of monei __PUNCT__
we run out of time __PUNCT__
it time for new leadership __PUNCT__
it time for a new approach __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ it time for america presid __PUNCT__ and anyon who want to be presid __PUNCT__ to look you in the ey and tell you the truth __PUNCT__
so here it is __PUNCT__
govern monei isn't __PUNCT__ free __PUNCT__
you and i either pai for it in tax __PUNCT__ or our children pai for it in debt __PUNCT__
the reform we need ar not in the billion __PUNCT__ but in the trillion of dollar __PUNCT__
and the cut we need to make __PUNCT__ the cut we must make __PUNCT__ can't just be to somebodi els program __PUNCT__
the chang histori is call on america to make todai cannot be shoulder onli by peopl richer than us or poorer than us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
politician ar often afraid that if thei too honest __PUNCT__ thei might lose an elect __PUNCT__
i afraid that in __NUM__ if we not honest enough __PUNCT__ we mai lose our countri __PUNCT__
if we want to grow our economi __PUNCT__ we need to shrink our govern __PUNCT__
if we want to creat job __PUNCT__ we need to encourag job creator __PUNCT__
if we want our children to be free to pursu their dream __PUNCT__ we can't shackl them with our debt __PUNCT__

no more subsidi __PUNCT__ no more special treatment __PUNCT__

success in our economi must onc again be determin by the ingenu of compet busi and the judgment of the marketplac __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__

thi week __PUNCT__ i also be in washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ to remind the feder bureaucraci that govern exist to serv it citizen __PUNCT__ not it employe __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ peopl get paid by the taxpay shouldn't get a better deal than the taxpay themselv __PUNCT__
that mean freez feder salari __PUNCT__ transit feder employe benefit __PUNCT__ and downsiz the feder workforc as it retir __PUNCT__

and in the privat sector __PUNCT__ it mean no card check __PUNCT__ not now __PUNCT__ not ever __PUNCT__
it mean no more taxpay bailout just becaus you gave lot of monei to a campaign __PUNCT__
and it especi mean the nation labor relat board will never again tell an american compani where it can and can't do busi __PUNCT__
i here todai to tell iowan the truth __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
america is face a crush debt crisi the like of which we never seen befor __PUNCT__
we need to cut spend __PUNCT__ and we need to cut it __PUNCT__ big time __PUNCT__
the hard truth is that there ar no longer ani sacr program __PUNCT__
the truth about feder energi subsidi __PUNCT__ includ feder subsidi for ethanol __PUNCT__ is that thei have to be phase out __PUNCT__
we need to do it gradual __PUNCT__
we need to do it fairli __PUNCT__
but we need to do it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i not some out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch politician __PUNCT__
i serv two term as governor of an ag state __PUNCT__
i fulli understand and respect the critic role farm plai in our economi and our societi __PUNCT__
i strongli support ethanol in variou wai over the year __PUNCT__ and i still believ in the promis of renew fuel __PUNCT__ both for our economi and our nation secur __PUNCT__
but even in minnesota __PUNCT__ when face with fiscal challeng __PUNCT__ we reduc ethanol subsidi __PUNCT__
that where we ar now in washington __PUNCT__ but on a much __PUNCT__ much larger scale __PUNCT__
it not onli ethanol __PUNCT__
we need to chang our approach to subsidi in all industri __PUNCT__
it can't be done overnight __PUNCT__
the industri ha made larg invest __PUNCT__ and it wouldn't be fair to pull the rug out from under it immedi __PUNCT__
but we must face the truth that if we want to invit more competit __PUNCT__ more invest __PUNCT__ and more innov into an industri __PUNCT__ we need to get govern out __PUNCT__
we also need the govern out of the busi of hand out favor and special deal __PUNCT__
the free market __PUNCT__ not freebi from politician __PUNCT__ should decid a compani success __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ as part of a larger reform __PUNCT__ we need to phase out subsidi across all sourc of energi and all industri __PUNCT__ includ ethanol __PUNCT__
we simpli can't afford them anymor __PUNCT__
some peopl will be upset by what i sai __PUNCT__
convent wisdom sai you can't talk about ethanol in iowa or social secur in florida or financi reform on wall street __PUNCT__
but someon ha to sai it __PUNCT__
someon ha to final stand up and level with the american peopl __PUNCT__
someon ha to lead __PUNCT__
when time get tough __PUNCT__ there alwai a temptat among politician to try to turn the american peopl against on __PUNCT__ anoth __PUNCT__
some try to fan the flame of envi and resent as a wai to deflect attent from their own respons __PUNCT__
but that not good enough __PUNCT__
our problem demand __PUNCT__ and our children deserv __PUNCT__ much more from us thi time __PUNCT__
no presid deserv to win an elect by divid the american peopl __PUNCT__ pick winner and loser __PUNCT__ protect hi own parti spend and cut onli the other gui __PUNCT__ pit class __PUNCT__ and ethnic __PUNCT__ and gener against each other __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
so we need to work to get out of thi mess togeth __PUNCT__
i unit our parti and unit our nation __PUNCT__ becaus to solv a fourteen __PUNCT__ trillion __PUNCT__ dollar problem __PUNCT__ we go to need three hundr million peopl __PUNCT__
leadership in a time of crisi isn't about tell peopl what you think thei want to hear __PUNCT__ it about tell the truth __PUNCT__
presid barack obama refus to do that __PUNCT__
he ha a simpl and cynic plan __PUNCT__ pretend there is no crisi __PUNCT__ then attack those of us who ar will to stand up and try to solv it __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ thei call that __PUNCT__ smart polit __PUNCT__
but i not from washington __PUNCT__
i grew up in minnesota __PUNCT__ in the hard __PUNCT__ work blue collar town of south saint paul __PUNCT__
when i wa __NUM__ year old my mom pass awai from ovarian cancer __PUNCT__
awhil later __PUNCT__ my dad lost hi job for a time __PUNCT__
in a situat like that __PUNCT__ you see some thing __PUNCT__
you learn some thing __PUNCT__
at a young ag __PUNCT__ i learn the valu of lean into my faith in god __PUNCT__ in challeng time and at all time __PUNCT__
i saw the valu of a love famili that ralli around each other in time of crisi __PUNCT__
i learn the valu of hard work and the respons for do my part __PUNCT__
i learn that educ wa a ticket to opportun __PUNCT__
i learn the valu of a job and a paycheck __PUNCT__
i got a chanc to work at a groceri store for about seven year __PUNCT__
i wa a union member __PUNCT__
i wa proud to earn some monei to help pai for school cost and make end meet __PUNCT__
the valu i learn ar america valu __PUNCT__
i know the american dream __PUNCT__ becaus i live it __PUNCT__
i am run for presid to keep that dream aliv __PUNCT__
the first step toward restor america promis __PUNCT__ is to elect a presid who keep hi promis __PUNCT__
how do i know conserv valu and principl can rescu our economi and reform our govern __PUNCT__ becaus in minnesota __PUNCT__ for the last eight year __PUNCT__ thei alreadi have __PUNCT__
i love my state but let face it __PUNCT__ it on of the most liber state in the union __PUNCT__
minnesota big __PUNCT__ govern legaci present me with the same type of problem barack obama found in the nation capit __PUNCT__
but my approach __PUNCT__ and my result __PUNCT__ were veri differ from hi __PUNCT__
when i becam governor __PUNCT__ minnesota two __PUNCT__ year budget had been increas an averag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ for over forti year __PUNCT__
dure my eight year __PUNCT__ that chang dramat __PUNCT__
i pass a budget that actual reduc state spend in real term for the first time in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year histori of minnesota __PUNCT__
for decad befor i wa elect __PUNCT__ governor tri and fail to get minnesota out of the top __PUNCT__ ten highest tax state in the countri __PUNCT__
i actual did it __PUNCT__
minnesota face health care cost that were spiral out of control __PUNCT__
sound familiar __PUNCT__ i know how to do health care reform right __PUNCT__
i done it at the state level __PUNCT__
no mandat __PUNCT__ no takeov __PUNCT__ and it the opposit of obamacar __PUNCT__
i took on the public employe union befor it wa popular to do it __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ our govern bu driver had benefit similar to those that ar break budget in california __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__ and half of europ __PUNCT__
i want to bring those benefit in line __PUNCT__
the union refus and went on strike __PUNCT__
it becam on of the longest transit strike in the histori of the countri __PUNCT__
peopl picket my hous __PUNCT__ the media trash me __PUNCT__ and the buse didn't move __PUNCT__
but neither did we __PUNCT__
on the __NUM__ dai of the strike __PUNCT__ the union came back to the tabl __PUNCT__ and taxpay won __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we have a transit system that give commut a ride __PUNCT__ without take the taxpay for a ride __PUNCT__
i stood up to the teacher union and establish on of the first statewid perform pai system in the countri __PUNCT__
and i appoint new conserv justic to the state suprem court __PUNCT__
thei understand that judg ar suppos to rule accord to the languag of the law __PUNCT__ not the prefer of their parti __PUNCT__
you know someth about that here in iowa __PUNCT__
in minnesota and in washington __PUNCT__ the issu were the same __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__ spend __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__ and the court __PUNCT__
but in washington __PUNCT__ barack obama ha consist stood for higher tax __PUNCT__ more spend __PUNCT__ more govern __PUNCT__ more power special interest __PUNCT__ and less individu freedom __PUNCT__
in minnesota __PUNCT__ i cut tax __PUNCT__ cut spend __PUNCT__ institut health care choic and perform pai for teacher __PUNCT__ reform our union benefit __PUNCT__ and appoint constitut conserv to the suprem court __PUNCT__
that is how you lead a liber state in a conserv direct __PUNCT__
the problem we face as a nation ar sever __PUNCT__
but if we could move minnesota in a common sens __PUNCT__ conserv direct __PUNCT__ we can do it anywher __PUNCT__ even in washington d.c __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but it not suppos to be __PUNCT__
thi is america __PUNCT__ we don't do easi __PUNCT__
vallei forg wasn't easi __PUNCT__
normandi wasn't easi __PUNCT__
win the cold war wasn't easi __PUNCT__
if prosper were easi __PUNCT__ everyon around the world would be prosper __PUNCT__
if secur were easi __PUNCT__ everyon around the world would be secur __PUNCT__
if freedom were easi __PUNCT__ everyon would be free __PUNCT__
thei not __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ american ar __PUNCT__ becaus our founder and gener befor us chose to be __PUNCT__ and insist __PUNCT__ sacrif __PUNCT__ and risk everyth __PUNCT__ so that we could be __PUNCT__
that their legaci __PUNCT__
