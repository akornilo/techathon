how ar you enjoi your recoveri summer __PUNCT__ that what the presid said we were have __PUNCT__
and that wa last year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ga is nearli __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
home price ar in the gutter __PUNCT__
our healthcar system __PUNCT__ thank to obamacar __PUNCT__ is more expens __PUNCT__
and less effici __PUNCT__
unemploy back over __NUM__ __PUNCT__
our nation debt ha skyrocket __PUNCT__
our budget deficit ha grown wors __PUNCT__
and the job and manufactur report ar grim __PUNCT__
if that wa a recoveri __PUNCT__ then our presid need to enter econom rehab __PUNCT__
and the american peopl need to stop hi polici __PUNCT__
cold turkei __PUNCT__
the addict to spend must be brought to a halt __PUNCT__
and we must have a presid who ha a growth agenda __PUNCT__
with pro __PUNCT__ growth polici i will __PUNCT__
the presid wrongli thought the stimulu __PUNCT__ the bailout and the takeov were the solut __PUNCT__
he sai thei work __PUNCT__
thei did not __PUNCT__
the presid is satisfi with a second __PUNCT__ rate american economi __PUNCT__
produc by hi third __PUNCT__ rate polici __PUNCT__
i not __PUNCT__
i promis to level with the american peopl __PUNCT__
to look them in the ey __PUNCT__
and tell them the truth __PUNCT__
i went to iowa __PUNCT__
and said we need to phase out feder ethanol subsidi __PUNCT__
i went to florida __PUNCT__
and said we need to rais the retir ag for the next gener __PUNCT__
and mean __PUNCT__ test cost __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ live adjust for social secur __PUNCT__
i went to new york citi __PUNCT__
and told wall street that the era of bailout __PUNCT__ carv __PUNCT__ out and handout had to end __PUNCT__
i will to tell american the hard truth __PUNCT__
and i believ american ar readi to hear it __PUNCT__
but the truth about our economi isn't hard at all __PUNCT__
market work __PUNCT__
barack obama central plan doesn't __PUNCT__
america economi is not even grow at __NUM__ __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__
and that what all project sai we can expect for the next decad __PUNCT__
that not accept __PUNCT__
it not the american wai __PUNCT__
the recess mai have chang our economi __PUNCT__
but it didn't chang our charact __PUNCT__
the unit state is still home to the most dynam and entrepreneuri peopl in the world __PUNCT__
thei all around us __PUNCT__
readi to innov __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ compet and creat new busi and job __PUNCT__
that will mean opportun for everyon __PUNCT__
thei been discourag and weigh down __PUNCT__
by presid obama big govern __PUNCT__
and heavi hand regul __PUNCT__
thei deserv a better deal __PUNCT__
i give them on __PUNCT__
and here it is __PUNCT__
let start with a big __PUNCT__ posit goal __PUNCT__
let grow the economi by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ instead of the anem __NUM__ __PUNCT__ current envis __PUNCT__
such a nation econom growth target will set our sight on a posit futur __PUNCT__
and inspir the action need to reach it __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ growth is not some pie __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ sky number __PUNCT__
we done it befor __PUNCT__
and with the right polici __PUNCT__ we can do it again __PUNCT__
between __NUM__ and __NUM__ the reagan recoveri grew at __NUM__ __PUNCT__
between __NUM__ and __NUM__ under presid bill clinton and a republican congress the economi grew at more than __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in each case million of new job were creat __PUNCT__ incom rose and unemploy fell to histor low __PUNCT__
the same can happen again __PUNCT__
grow at __NUM__ __PUNCT__ a year __PUNCT__ rather than the current level of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ would net us million of new job __PUNCT__
trillion of dollar in new wealth __PUNCT__
put us on a path to save our entitl program __PUNCT__
and balanc the feder budget __PUNCT__
how do we do it __PUNCT__ in short __PUNCT__ we creat more econom growth __PUNCT__
by creat more econom freedom __PUNCT__
we should start by overhaul the tax code __PUNCT__
it current an anti __PUNCT__ growth __PUNCT__ nine thousand page monstros __PUNCT__
that chock full of special deal for special interest __PUNCT__
it main goal __PUNCT__ seem to be to gener campaign contribut __PUNCT__
not job __PUNCT__
american busi todai pai the second highest tax rate in the world __PUNCT__
that a recip for failur __PUNCT__ not ad job and econom growth __PUNCT__
we should cut the busi tax rate by more than half __PUNCT__
i propos reduc the current rate from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but our polici can't just be about simpli cut __URL__ must also promot freedom and free market __PUNCT__
the tax code is litter with special interest handout __PUNCT__ carv __PUNCT__ out __PUNCT__ subsidi and loophol __PUNCT__
that should be elimin __PUNCT__
such reform would not onli help offset short __PUNCT__ term revenu loss from the rate cut __PUNCT__
but it would also reduc cronyism __PUNCT__ favorit and govern manipul market for polit purpos __PUNCT__
busi success should depend on win over custom __PUNCT__
not win over congressman __PUNCT__
these chang will make american compani immedi more competit __PUNCT__
invest from around the world will pour into our suddenli invit market __PUNCT__
creat desper need job and opportun __PUNCT__
but just chang busi tax rate isn't enough __PUNCT__
that becaus we know most job growth will come from small and medium size busi __PUNCT__
typic structur as s corp or llc __PUNCT__
and their owner ar tax under individu tax rate __PUNCT__
not corpor tax rate __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ job and pro __PUNCT__ growth tax reform must includ individu tax reform as well __PUNCT__
small busi owner and hard work american need a better deal too __PUNCT__
small busi should also have the option of pai at the corpor rate __PUNCT__
on the individu rate we need a simpler __PUNCT__ fairer and flatter tax system overal __PUNCT__
i propos just two rate __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ those who current pai no incom tax would stai at a zero rate __PUNCT__
after that __PUNCT__ the first fifti __PUNCT__ thousand dollar of incom or on __PUNCT__ hundr thousand for marri coupl would be tax at __NUM__ __PUNCT__
everyth abov that would be tax at __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that it __PUNCT__
a on __PUNCT__ third cut in the bottom __URL__ allow younger __PUNCT__ middl and lower __PUNCT__ incom famili to save and build wealth __PUNCT__
and a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ cut in the top rate to spur invest and job creation __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ we should elimin all togeth the capit gain tax __PUNCT__ interest incom tax __PUNCT__ dividend tax and the death __URL__ ha no moral or econom basi to claim a second share of the same incom __PUNCT__
when you deposit a dollar in your bank account __PUNCT__
everi penni should be forevermor your and your children __PUNCT__
not the feder govern __PUNCT__
onc we unleash the creativ energi of america busi __PUNCT__ famili and individu as we did in the eighti and nineti __PUNCT__
a boom job market will reduc demand for govern assist __PUNCT__
and rise incom will increas feder revenu __PUNCT__
in the 1980 __PUNCT__ revenu increas by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in the 1990 __PUNCT__ revenu climb high enough to balanc the budget __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ econom growth over __NUM__ year would gener __NUM__ trillion dollar in new tax revenu __PUNCT__
with that __PUNCT__ we would reduc project deficit by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
all befor we made a singl budget cut __PUNCT__
the next part of my plan deal with that other __NUM__ __PUNCT__
a balanc feder budget shouldn't be a polit sound bite __PUNCT__
it should be the law of the land __PUNCT__
as on of __NUM__ governor oper with a balanc budget requir __PUNCT__
i balanc __NUM__ biennial budget in my two term as governor of minnesota __PUNCT__
and i know the onli reason our legislatur ever gave me a balanc budget wa becaus under our constitut thei had to __PUNCT__
we have to face the truth __PUNCT__ congress is addict to spend __PUNCT__
and that true regardless of which parti is in control __PUNCT__
the best wai __PUNCT__ and possibl the onli wai to ensur fiscal disciplin is to put the congress in a spend straightjacket __PUNCT__
that why i support a constitut amend __PUNCT__
that not onli requir a balanc feder budget __PUNCT__
but also cap feder spend as a percentag of our economi __PUNCT__
around the histor averag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of gdp __PUNCT__
onli a constitut amend ha the power to bind futur congress to keep their promis __PUNCT__
forc decis __PUNCT__ maker to final make decis __PUNCT__
and give statutori reform a chanc to succe __PUNCT__
but pass a constitut amend will take awhil __PUNCT__
and the crisi that we face is here now __PUNCT__
and requir immedi action __PUNCT__
i have and will continu to outlin specif propos to reduc spend __PUNCT__ reform govern and balanc the budget __PUNCT__
as mention i alreadi begun that process __PUNCT__
with propos regard ethanol __PUNCT__ entitl __PUNCT__ govern employe and wall street __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ i propos cap and block __PUNCT__ grant medicaid to the state __PUNCT__
rais the social secur retir ag for the next gener __PUNCT__
and slow the rate of growth in defens spend __PUNCT__
but we can't trust congress to do it __PUNCT__
we cannot allow the situat to risk be unresolv __PUNCT__
and take down america potenti for growth and prosper __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i propos that congress grant the presid the temporari and emerg author __PUNCT__
to freez spend at current level __PUNCT__
and impound up to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of feder spend __PUNCT__
until such time as the budget is balanc __PUNCT__
if thei won't do it __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__
as an exampl __PUNCT__ cut just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of overal feder spend for __NUM__ consecut year would balanc the feder budget by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i know govern can cut spend __PUNCT__
becaus i did it in minnesota __PUNCT__
i cut state spend in real term for the first time in our state histori __PUNCT__
we did it with prioriti __PUNCT__ base budget __PUNCT__
we did it by set a record for veto __PUNCT__
it took a govern shutdown __PUNCT__
and a long govern union strike __PUNCT__
but we got it done __PUNCT__
we didn't close our school __PUNCT__
or empti out our prison __PUNCT__
we cut spend where it need to be cut __PUNCT__
we can do the same thing in washington __PUNCT__
impound the monei should onli be a last resort __PUNCT__
to forc policymak to final do their job __PUNCT__
to cut what we don't need __PUNCT__
to allow us to keep the thing we need most __PUNCT__
there some obviou target __PUNCT__
we can start by appli what i call __PUNCT__ the googl test __PUNCT__ if you can find a good or servic on the internet __PUNCT__
then the feder govern probabl doesn't need to be do it __PUNCT__
the post offic __PUNCT__ the govern print offic __PUNCT__ amtrak __PUNCT__ fanni and freddi were all built for a differ time in our countri __PUNCT__
when the privat sector did not adequ provid those servic __PUNCT__
that no longer the case __PUNCT__
what more __PUNCT__ the same competit effici that revolution america privat sector over the last three decad should at long last be appli to everi corner of the feder bureaucraci as well __PUNCT__
it is no longer enough for govern to go on a diet __PUNCT__
govern need to hit the gym __PUNCT__
on effici program __PUNCT__ lean six sigma __PUNCT__ alreadi ha a proven track record __PUNCT__
us perform __PUNCT__ base manag practic to streamlin program at the cia and the pentagon __PUNCT__
and as i can person attest variou agenc of the minnesota state govern __PUNCT__
if we appli thi approach throughout all feder agenc we could save up to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ in mani program __PUNCT__
beyond all of thi __PUNCT__ the real slog of the next administr will be an unrel trench battl against the over __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__
that suffoc america entrepreneuri spirit __PUNCT__
conserv have long made the feder bureaucraci the butt of joke __PUNCT__
and consid that some bureaucrat in washington is actual in charg of the strength of our showerhead __PUNCT__ the vigor of our toilet flush or the glow of our read lamp it hard not to laugh __PUNCT__
but the fact is __PUNCT__ feder regul will cost our economi __NUM__ trillion dollar thi year alon __PUNCT__
it a hidden tax on everi american consum __PUNCT__
built into the price of everi good and servic in the economi __PUNCT__
and make no mistak __PUNCT__
the current administr is hunt far bigger game than the incandesc light bulb __PUNCT__
under obamacar individu and employ mandat america privat health care market is in intens care __PUNCT__
and the prognosi is bad __PUNCT__
the dodd __PUNCT__ frank financi regul bill call for more than __NUM__ new rule __PUNCT__
to be written by more than ten feder agenc __PUNCT__
none of them resolv the catastroph scandal of fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__
month after the law went on the book __PUNCT__ no on yet know exactli what the law is __PUNCT__
and the environment protect agenc is now regul carbon emiss __PUNCT__
a polici reject by congress but put million of job at risk __PUNCT__
if these polici sound as though thei were written by peopl who have spent no time outsid govern __PUNCT__ well you right __PUNCT__
presid obama polit appointe have been notori for their lack of privat sector experi __PUNCT__
thi is unaccept __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ s fundament immor to forc work american to hold down two or three real job __PUNCT__
just to afford the whim of __PUNCT__ expert __PUNCT__ who never had on __PUNCT__
we don't need obamacar to creat a on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit __PUNCT__ all govern __PUNCT__ run health care program __PUNCT__
we need washington to allow a person __PUNCT__ privat health care market to flourish __PUNCT__
and meet the divers need of individu patient __PUNCT__
we don't need dodd __PUNCT__ frank to further intertwin wall street and pennsylvania avenu __PUNCT__
we need to privat fanni and freddi __PUNCT__
and remov the threat that their polit slush fund can never again sink our economi __PUNCT__
and we don't need the unelect offici at epa to do what our elect offici in congress have reject __PUNCT__
we need less epa monitor of our economi __PUNCT__
and more monitor of epa affect on our freedom __PUNCT__
i will requir sunset of all feder regul __PUNCT__
unless specif sustain by a vote of congress __PUNCT__
under my administr the nlrb will never tell an american compani where thei can and cannot do busi __PUNCT__
just as the feder govern must break down barrier within our domest market __PUNCT__
we must break down barrier in intern market __PUNCT__
congress should ratifi complet free trade agreement with south korea and colombia __PUNCT__
and complet the agreement with panama __PUNCT__
we should start new bilater talk with our trade partner __PUNCT__
to promot our export __PUNCT__
presid obama set a goal of doubl export __PUNCT__
yet hi polici have prevent thi __PUNCT__
mine will achiev it __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ even if we ar success in chang the wai washington tax __PUNCT__ spend and regul __PUNCT__
mani of the gain we realiz could be lost by the continu debas of the dollar __PUNCT__
as a result of the loos __PUNCT__ monei polici of the fed __PUNCT__
a strong dollar undergird all that we do for econom growth __PUNCT__
inflat cruelli undermin the life save and life prospect of everi american __PUNCT__
if we want to give taxpay __PUNCT__ retire __PUNCT__ investorss __PUNCT__ consum and entrepreneur a better deal __PUNCT__ we have to maintain a strong dollar __PUNCT__
no more quantit eas __PUNCT__
no more monet debt __PUNCT__
no more print monei with reckless abandon the presid and congress have everi incent to maxim employ __PUNCT__
and a limit govern __PUNCT__ streamlin tax system and competit marketplac will give the economi what it need to do so __PUNCT__
we need monetari polici that is focus like a laser on curb inflat __PUNCT__
and maintain price stabil __PUNCT__
that should be the role of the fed __PUNCT__
and noth more __PUNCT__
america is face grave challeng __PUNCT__
and when time get tough __PUNCT__ some politician try to turn the american peopl against on __PUNCT__ anoth __PUNCT__
regrett __PUNCT__ presid obama is a champion practition of class warfar __PUNCT__
elect with a call for uniti and hope __PUNCT__
he spent three year divid our nation __PUNCT__
and fan the flame of class envi and resent __PUNCT__
to deflect attent from hi own failur __PUNCT__
and the econom hardship thei have visit on america __PUNCT__
but class warfar is not who we ar __PUNCT__
i come from a work class background __PUNCT__
i didn't grow up with wealth __PUNCT__
but i never resent those who have it __PUNCT__
the top ten percent of incom earner alreadi pai more than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of incom tax __PUNCT__
we could jack that up to __NUM__ or __NUM__ __PUNCT__ as presid obama would have us do __PUNCT__
but that not the __URL__ it might make the class warfar crusad feel better __PUNCT__
it wouldn't creat a singl job in america __PUNCT__
and it would destroi mani __PUNCT__
presid obama ha had three year to turn thing around __PUNCT__
and all we have to show for it is __NUM__ trillion dollar more debt __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ million fewer job __PUNCT__
a congress that hasn't pass a budget in more than __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
a health care takeov he pretend we can afford __PUNCT__
and a fiscal crisi he pretend we can ignor __PUNCT__
we tri presid obama wai and it ha onli made the economi wors __PUNCT__
other countri around the world have tri presid obama wai and have met with ruinou result __PUNCT__
we have a choic __PUNCT__
just becaus we follow ancient greec into democraci __PUNCT__
doesn't mean we doom to follow modern greec into bankruptci __PUNCT__
the unit state ha alwai chosen it own path cultur __PUNCT__ polit and econom __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year we taken the road less travel __PUNCT__
the road of liberti __PUNCT__
of self __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
and free enterpris __PUNCT__
and it ha made all the differ __PUNCT__
america is in troubl __PUNCT__
there no question __PUNCT__
but the frustrat and apprehens of the moment doesn't defin us __PUNCT__
where we ar __PUNCT__ is not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we settl the west and went to the moon __PUNCT__
we liber billion of good peopl from commun __PUNCT__ fascism __PUNCT__ and jihad __PUNCT__
we lit the lamp of freedom __PUNCT__ for the entir world to see __PUNCT__
the strength of our countri is our peopl not our govern __PUNCT__
american believ our countri is except __PUNCT__
and thei deserv a presid who doe too __PUNCT__
we can fix our economi __PUNCT__
our peopl ar readi to get back to work __PUNCT__
we just need to give them to tool to get there __PUNCT__
and get the govern out of the wai __PUNCT__
