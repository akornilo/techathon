__PUNCT__ the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ __NUM__ vote wa a triumph for democrat __PUNCT__ who just week ago worri about the polit wisdom of a veto showdown with the command in chief as troop fight on the battlefield __PUNCT__
but democrat ar hesit no more __PUNCT__
why did you vote for a bill that had a timet for withdraw __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ that languag is actual the languag that i __PUNCT__ that carl levin and i draft __PUNCT__ which said that __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ you got to start move combat troop out of harm wai now __PUNCT__
the whole function of thi is to try to get thi presid to chang hi strategi __PUNCT__
he oper on the premis that __PUNCT__ if we put enough troop in the middl of a civil war __PUNCT__ we can give breed room to a group of peopl in baghdad to get togeth and form a strong central govern that a democraci __PUNCT__
that will not happen in your lifetim or mine __PUNCT__
i said that four year ago __PUNCT__ i sai it now __PUNCT__
the onli ration purpos for troop in iraq now __PUNCT__ train iraqi __PUNCT__ prevent al __PUNCT__ qaeda from occupi larg chunk of territori __PUNCT__
and we should begin to decentr the govern __PUNCT__
that the underli essenc of what the languag in thi bill is about __PUNCT__
it sai __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ start now to redeploi and have as a target to get out by __DATE__ the bulk of the combat troop __PUNCT__
i strongli subscrib to that view __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ when you were here in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i ask you about some of these step __PUNCT__ and thi is how you respond __PUNCT__
let watch __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ i think it is unconstitut to sai we go to tell you __PUNCT__ you can go __PUNCT__ but we go to micromanag the war __PUNCT__
when we wrote the constitut __PUNCT__ the intent wa to give the command in chief the author how to us the forc when you author him to be abl to us the forc __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ aren't you now micromanag __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ not at all __PUNCT__
did you hear what i said __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ how to us the forc __PUNCT__
we have author to tell him how to us the forc __PUNCT__
if you get in there __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ and onc you tell him __PUNCT__ we have __PUNCT__ we have a respons to tell him what the mission is __PUNCT__
he doe not have the author to engag in a mission of the us of our forc in a countri or out of a countri that we do not author __PUNCT__
and that the thrust of what we try to do here __PUNCT__
we try to fundament chang what thi presid is us our forc for __PUNCT__
he in the midst of a civil war with the object of __PUNCT__ a flaw object of establish a strong central govern __PUNCT__
that will not happen __PUNCT__ and we have an oblig to push back as much and as often and as thoroughli as we can __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ there ha been an evolut in your think becaus thi is what you said in __PUNCT__ to the brook institut in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we can __PUNCT__ tell it __PUNCT__ we can call it quit and withdraw __PUNCT__ from iraq __PUNCT__
i think that would be a gigant mistak __PUNCT__
or we can set a deadlin for pull out __PUNCT__ which i fear will onli encourag our enemi to wait us out __PUNCT__ equal a mistak __PUNCT__
you now set a deadlin __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ we not set a deadlin __PUNCT__
read what it sai __PUNCT__
it sai the target date __PUNCT__ left up to the gener to determin whether or not it is appropri to withdraw all forc __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ a target date is set a deadlin __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ but it leav forc behind __PUNCT__
we try to chang the mission __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
the mission is all of us have been argu on except __PUNCT__ in both parti __PUNCT__ that you go to have to leav forc behind in iraq while thi new govern __PUNCT__ if we actual get on up and run __PUNCT__ is try to function and try to set up __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ the problem here is thi is also a move target __PUNCT__
i also call for more troop in iraq __PUNCT__
i call for more troop on thi program a coupl year ago __PUNCT__
that wa in order to stop a civil war __PUNCT__
onc the civil war began i wa on the program after that sai all the troop in the world cannot settl a civil war __PUNCT__
so what i have to respond to __PUNCT__ like everyon els __PUNCT__ is the presid initi and hi failur that __PUNCT__ that requir differ circumst and differ answer at differ time __PUNCT__
but the fundament principl the same __PUNCT__ we have an oblig to tell the presid of the unit state if we disagre with the mission for which he us american forc __PUNCT__
and the mission that he ha us on is to settl a civil war through establish a central democrat govern in baghdad __PUNCT__
that mission is strateg flaw __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you no longer have a problem set a date for withdraw __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ i no longer have a problem set a target __PUNCT__ a target that is flexibl __PUNCT__
there is no __PUNCT__ there noth in it sai that everi troop ha to be out on __DATE__ the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you said thi back in __DATE__ of __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ we must be clear with the american peopl that we ar commit to iraq for the long haul __PUNCT__ not just the dai after __PUNCT__ but the decad after __PUNCT__
do you believ we be in iraq for a decad __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ i said back then __PUNCT__ befor we went to war __PUNCT__ i wrote a report sai the decad after __PUNCT__ and everyon wa talk about the dai after __PUNCT__
and the point i wa make wa __PUNCT__ if you went in and us forc __PUNCT__ which he should not have done when he did it __PUNCT__ that we were commit and sign on to a decad __PUNCT__
that wa the __PUNCT__ that wa the minimum requir __PUNCT__
i also point out we need more troop __PUNCT__
i also point out at that time we would not be greet with open arm __PUNCT__
i also point out at that time oil would not pai for thi __PUNCT__
it wa a warn __PUNCT__ a warn to the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ the object of us give you thi author is to get inspector back in __PUNCT__ bring the pressur of the world commun __PUNCT__ which rememb __PUNCT__ at the time __PUNCT__ when we were sit here talk about thi __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ at that moment the issu wa ar we go to pull out of __PUNCT__ ar we go to lift sanction on iraq or ar we go to put more sanction on iraq __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ that wa the context in which that debat wa take place __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so when some of your oppon in the democrat primari sai there will be no residu forc left in iraq __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ thei ar mistaken __PUNCT__
thei ar make a mistak that is not practic __PUNCT__
i don't know how that can work __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ senat reid __PUNCT__ the leader of the democrat in the senat __PUNCT__ senat feingold __PUNCT__ the senat from wisconsin __PUNCT__ have join togeth and introduc a bill __PUNCT__ and here the oper languag __PUNCT__ no fund appropri or otherwis made avail under ani provis of law mai be oblig or expend to continu the deploy in iraq after march __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
do you support that __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ why __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ for the reason i just state __PUNCT__
i think it __PUNCT__ mai __PUNCT__ we mai end __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ here where we mai end up __PUNCT__
thi presid mai so __PUNCT__ make it so difficult to reach the object __PUNCT__ the onli reason on i think avail __PUNCT__ which is to leav iraq __PUNCT__ leav behind a countri secur within it own border __PUNCT__ not a threat to it neighbor __PUNCT__ that is a loos feder republ __PUNCT__
it mai get so bad that we do not have that option __PUNCT__ and all of the option we have avail to us is to withdraw and try to contain the civil war insid iraq __PUNCT__
we ar not there yet __PUNCT__
and until we reach that point __PUNCT__ i am not prepar to sai there ar no circumst under which __PUNCT__ after a date certain __PUNCT__ we would not have a singl troop insid of iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so you will not vote to cut off fund for the war __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ that not what i said __PUNCT__
i just got finish tell you what i said __PUNCT__ which wa if __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ thi presid chang the circumst again __PUNCT__ where there lose all prospect of be abl to achiev the goal that i just set out __PUNCT__ which i think could be achiev if we decentr power in iraq __PUNCT__ if we have a limit feder govern in iraq __PUNCT__ where we train the armi __PUNCT__ where thei have control of the border and their currenc __PUNCT__ where we give control over the fabric of the daili live of the variou war faction __PUNCT__ includ their local polic forc __PUNCT__ their law relat to marriag __PUNCT__ divorc __PUNCT__ the thing thei kill each other over __PUNCT__ if we get to the point where that is no longer an option and the place ha total disintegr __PUNCT__ which it mai __PUNCT__ that a differ circumst __PUNCT__
you can't __PUNCT__ i don't know anyon who can sai __PUNCT__ i speak for myself __PUNCT__
i cannot sai for __PUNCT__ with absolut certainti what i will do on everi potenti conting becaus i have no control over thi presid foreign polici and the direct he take us in iraq __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but as of todai __PUNCT__ you would not vote to cut off __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ as of todai __PUNCT__ i would not vote to cut off all fund if the fund cutoff said there can be absolut not a singl solitari american forc left anywher within iraq within a time certain __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ i want to go back to __NUM__ becaus it import as to what peopl were sai then and what the american peopl were hear __PUNCT__
here joe biden about saddam hussein __PUNCT__ he a long term threat and a short term threat to our nation secur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we have no choic but to elimin the threat __PUNCT__
thi is a gui who is an extrem danger to the world __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ he must be dislodg from hi weapon or dislodg from power __PUNCT__
you were emphat about that __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__ and i wa correct about that __PUNCT__
he must be __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ and rememb the weapon we were talk about __PUNCT__
i also said on your show __PUNCT__ that part of what i said __PUNCT__ but not all of what i meant __PUNCT__
what i also said on your show at the time wa that i did not think he had weapon hi materi __PUNCT__ but he did have __PUNCT__
when __PUNCT__ when the inspector left after saddam kick them out __PUNCT__ there wa a catalogu at the unit nation sai he had x ton of __PUNCT__ x amount of __PUNCT__ and thei list the variou materi he had __PUNCT__
the big issu __PUNCT__ rememb __PUNCT__ on thi show we talk about __PUNCT__ wa whether he had weapon them __PUNCT__
rememb you ask me about those flight that were take place in southern iraq __PUNCT__ where __PUNCT__ were thei sprai anthrax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what would happen __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ so on and so forth __PUNCT__
and i point out to you that thei had not develop that capac at all __PUNCT__
but he did have these stockpil everywher __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ where ar thei __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the point is __PUNCT__ it turn out thei didn't __PUNCT__ but everyon in the world thought he had them __PUNCT__
the weapon inspector said he had them __PUNCT__
he catalogu __PUNCT__ thei catalogu them __PUNCT__
thi wa not some __PUNCT__ some chenei __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ pipe dream __PUNCT__
thi wa __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ catalogu __PUNCT__
thei look at them and catalogu __PUNCT__
what he did with them __PUNCT__ who know __PUNCT__ the real mysteri is __PUNCT__ if he __PUNCT__ if he didn't have ani of them left __PUNCT__ why didn't he sai so __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl sai if he had said that __PUNCT__ he would __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ embolden iran and so on and so forth __PUNCT__
but the point wa __PUNCT__ we were talk then about whether or not we could keep the pressur of the intern commun on iraq to stai in the box we had them in __PUNCT__
and rememb __PUNCT__ you had the french and other sai the reason all those children were dy in iraq __PUNCT__ the reason why hospit didn't have equip is becaus of what we __PUNCT__ the unit state __PUNCT__ were do __PUNCT__ impos on iraq these sanction __PUNCT__
and that wa the battl __PUNCT__
the battl wa do we lift these sanction or do we in fact increas the sanction __PUNCT__ and everyon at the time wa talk about __PUNCT__ from the secretari of state to even the presid __PUNCT__ that thi wa to demonstr to the world the presid of the unit state had the full faith and credit of the unit state congress behind him to put pressur on the rest of the world to sai __PUNCT__ hei __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ you lift the sanction __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ we go to be on our own here __PUNCT__
don't lift the sanction __PUNCT__
get the inspector back in __PUNCT__
that wa the context of the debat __PUNCT__ to be fair about it __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but when you read the nation intellig estim __PUNCT__ which ha now been releas __PUNCT__ there a lot of caveat put on the level of intellig about the aluminum tube and __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ gener zinni __PUNCT__ who been on thi program a few week ago __PUNCT__ said that when he heard the discuss about the weapon of mass destruct that saddam had __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ i never heard that __PUNCT__ in ani of the brief he had as head of the central command __PUNCT__
how could you as a u. __PUNCT__ senat be so wrong __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i wasn't wrong __PUNCT__
i wa on your show when you ask me about aluminum tube __PUNCT__ and i said thei for artilleri __PUNCT__
i don't believ thei for cascad __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but you said saddam wa a threat __PUNCT__
he had to be __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ he wa a threat __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ in what wai __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ the threat he present wa that __PUNCT__ if saddam wa left unfett __PUNCT__ which i said dure that period __PUNCT__ for the next five year with sanction lift and billion of dollar into hi coffer __PUNCT__ then i believ he had the abil to acquir a tactic nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ not by build it __PUNCT__ by purchas it __PUNCT__
i also believ he wa a threat in that he wa __PUNCT__ everi singl solitari u.n __PUNCT__ resolut which he agre to abid by __PUNCT__ which wa the equival of a peac agreement at the unit nation __PUNCT__ after he got out of __PUNCT__ after we kick him out of kuwait __PUNCT__ he wa violat __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the rule of the road either mean someth or thei don't __PUNCT__
the intern commun sai __PUNCT__ we go to enforc the sanction we place __PUNCT__ or not __PUNCT__
and what wa the intern commun do __PUNCT__ the intern commun wa weaken __PUNCT__
thei were pull awai __PUNCT__
thei were sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ wait a minut __PUNCT__
mayb he not so bad __PUNCT__
mayb we should lift the no __PUNCT__ fly zone __PUNCT__
mayb we should lift the sanction __PUNCT__
that wa the context __PUNCT__
and on your show __PUNCT__ you had that on sundai the vice presid of the unit state sai he reconstitut hi nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
i wa on a simultan program __PUNCT__ thei ask me the question __PUNCT__
i said either the presid __PUNCT__ either the vice presid not tell the truth or he did not get the same brief i have or he fulli misunderstand what he wa told __PUNCT__
so i did not believ he had weapon hi materi __PUNCT__
but he did have materi that __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ could theoret be weapon __PUNCT__
and to let it sit there at the time __PUNCT__ i want the inspector back in to forc him that posit of have to give it up __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you were ask on thi program a few month after the invas of mai of __PUNCT__ __NUM__ about your vote __PUNCT__
and you said __PUNCT__ there wa suffici evid to go into iraq __PUNCT__
and then in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ you said __PUNCT__ a year and a half ago __PUNCT__ i vote to give the presid the author to us forc in iraq __PUNCT__
i still believ my vote wa just __PUNCT__
then you went to iowa in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ run for presid and said __PUNCT__ it wa a mistak __PUNCT__
i regret my vote __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ that unfair __PUNCT__
i said that on your program it wa a mistak between __PUNCT__ and you make it sound like i went to iowa and all of a sudden i had peopl out there sai biden is __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ there wa a chang in your think from __PUNCT__ from be __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ a just vote to sai it wa a mistak __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ becaus i learn more __PUNCT__ like everybodi els learn __PUNCT__ about what __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ we were told __PUNCT__
even the stuff we were told __PUNCT__ the part that i believ about what wa go on with saddam __PUNCT__
we were told at the time __PUNCT__ rememb __PUNCT__ that all these iraqi gener were readi to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ to step up and take on saddam __PUNCT__ that we had __PUNCT__ it wa impli that we had thi abil to go __PUNCT__ to do a lot of thing we didn't do __PUNCT__
we had commit at the time from the presid that he would not move without the intern commun with us __PUNCT__
there were a whole lot of thing that chang __PUNCT__ a whole lot of thing that chang __PUNCT__
the thing that i regret __PUNCT__ and i sai it again __PUNCT__ and i said it wai befor __PUNCT__ __NUM__ and go to iowa __PUNCT__ is that i regret have had the __PUNCT__ believ that thi administr had ani compet __PUNCT__
it is the most incompet administr i ever __PUNCT__ if i known thei were go to misus the author we gave them the wai thei did __PUNCT__ if i known that thei were go to __PUNCT__ onc thei us it __PUNCT__ be so incompet in the us of it __PUNCT__ i would have never ever __PUNCT__ ever given them the author __PUNCT__
if i were presid __PUNCT__ would i have ask for the author __PUNCT__ i would have ask for the author in order to demonstr to the world that thei better not be lift sanction __PUNCT__ thei better not be put pressur on have no __PUNCT__ fly zone __PUNCT__ and thei better join with us in put the screw onto saddam by screw down the sanction on saddam as oppos to lift the sanction __PUNCT__
that what the debat wa about at the time __PUNCT__
and the other thing peopl forget __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is everybodi said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how could you not know that __PUNCT__ almost everi major editori board in the countri reach the same conclus that we reach about the valu of keep the sanction on saddam and the need to show the world thi pressur wa avail __PUNCT__
and why did thei think it __PUNCT__ thei thought it becaus he had act rel reason with regard to afghanistan __PUNCT__
the presid had act ration with regard to afghanistan __PUNCT__ and on your show __PUNCT__ i rememb be on your show at the end of that year __PUNCT__ and the question wa __PUNCT__ ha the presid becom an internationalist __PUNCT__ rememb that __PUNCT__ rememb that whole __PUNCT__ those __PUNCT__ those discuss __PUNCT__ so the idea that everybodi should have known that thei were go to be as irrespons in the us of the author __PUNCT__ that thei were go to overrul what __PUNCT__ what powel wa get done at the unit nation __PUNCT__ that thei had inspector back in and then thei were go to di the inspector like the vice presid and presid did __PUNCT__ mayb i should have anticip that __PUNCT__
but most peopl didn't anticip it __PUNCT__ and i __PUNCT__ and that my mistak __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ should you have gone or sought out peopl who had a dissent view on the level of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
i did __PUNCT__
and when i wa chairman of the committe __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i can't tell you the detail __PUNCT__ but i call everi intellig agenc befor the foreign relat committe __PUNCT__ had them all sit there at onc __PUNCT__
and it wa on the aluminium tube __PUNCT__
and i point out to all my colleagu who came that there wa vast disagr among the intellig commun __PUNCT__
i also said __PUNCT__ you rememb after thi period __PUNCT__ that i believ that the on part of georg tenet that i heard about hi book that i believ is right is that the __PUNCT__ it wasn't the administr got all bad intellig __PUNCT__ thei misus __PUNCT__ deliber misus the intellig thei had __PUNCT__
thei onli told you the down side __PUNCT__
thei did not tell you the doubt that exist within the intellig commun __PUNCT__
i met with gener zinni __PUNCT__ i met with all our major command at the time __PUNCT__ and thei were split about whether or not what he had __PUNCT__
but by and larg __PUNCT__ i don't think ani of them realli believ that somehow he had a nuclear weapon in the wait __PUNCT__
nobodi believ that __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but despit the doubt you heard __PUNCT__ you vote for the war __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ despit the doubt i heard __PUNCT__ i vote to give the presid the author to avoid a war __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ he also had __PUNCT__ there wa no question in the mind __PUNCT__ rememb we were __PUNCT__ we were on thi show __PUNCT__ dick lugar and i __PUNCT__
we had the biden/lugar author through __PUNCT__ of the presid __PUNCT__ which wa much more constrain __PUNCT__ much more constrain than the author he actual got __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ and what __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ what happen wa __PUNCT__ i didn't know dick gephardt and joe lieberman were separ negoti with the presid until i got a call on a mondai night from dick lugar sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we go to lose our __PUNCT__ our __PUNCT__ our amend __PUNCT__ which is much more constrict on the presid becaus there been a separ deal be cut __PUNCT__
he had __NUM__ vote no matter what __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but make no mistak about it __PUNCT__ the bill that you vote for author the presid to go to war __PUNCT__
biden __PUNCT__ it allow the presid to go to war __PUNCT__
it did not author him to go to it __PUNCT__
you make it sound like it said __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ go to war __PUNCT__
it said __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ don't go to war __PUNCT__
it said __PUNCT__ go to the unit nation __PUNCT__

that what it said __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you believ we safer now that saddam is gone __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ i believ we ar less safe as a nation now becaus what ha happen is the conduct of thi war ha so badli damag our readi __PUNCT__ the conduct of thi war __PUNCT__ and the __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and the blood and resourc we had to expend __PUNCT__ it ha limit our credibl around the world and limit our flexibl in term of the us of forc __PUNCT__
here we ar __PUNCT__ we could end the carnag in darfur tomorrow __PUNCT__ but why aren't we do it __PUNCT__ in part we not do it becaus we ar so ti down __PUNCT__
we could fundament chang the dynam in afghanistan __PUNCT__
why aren't we do it __PUNCT__ becaus we ar ti down __PUNCT__
so in a broad __PUNCT__ broad sens __PUNCT__ so when i come back on my __NUM__ __PUNCT__ if you invit me back __PUNCT__ or my __NUM__ trip here __PUNCT__ you don't sai __PUNCT__ well biden __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ you realli like saddam __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that not what thi is about __PUNCT__
what it about is saddam wa a butcher __PUNCT__ the world happi __PUNCT__ mai he burn in hell __PUNCT__
he deserv it __PUNCT__
but in term of our global __PUNCT__ global posit __PUNCT__ our geopolit strategi __PUNCT__ as the think __PUNCT__ tank gui down here talk about it __PUNCT__ we ar wors off than we were when we had saddam sit there becaus of the impact on our militari and the impact on our credibl __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the leader of the democrat __PUNCT__ harri reid __PUNCT__ two week ago offer some comment __PUNCT__
let me share them with you and our viewer and come back and talk about them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ videotap __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__
major leader harri reid __PUNCT__ d __PUNCT__ nv __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ myself __PUNCT__ that the secretari of state __PUNCT__ secretari of defens __PUNCT__ and you have to make your own decis as to what the presid know __PUNCT__ that thi war is lost __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ end videotap __PUNCT__ russert __PUNCT__ do you believ the secretari of state __PUNCT__ secretari of defens believ the war is lost __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ i believ the secretari of state and secretari of defens believ thei don't know what to do with it __PUNCT__ and thei plan on hand thi war over to the next presid __PUNCT__
i said that a year ago __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ do you believ the war is lost __PUNCT__ biden __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ thi is __PUNCT__ thi is not a game show __PUNCT__ where you know __PUNCT__ a,a __PUNCT__ a footbal game __PUNCT__
what thi is about is we have lost __NUM__ dead __PUNCT__ we have __NUM__ wound __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ and we still have an opportun to deal with the possibl of not trade a dictat for chao __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ but it will not happen unless we have a seriou chang in our oper strateg premis __PUNCT__
and that is we have to decentr __PUNCT__ not central thi govern __PUNCT__
we got to get the world commun in on own part of thi __PUNCT__ by call an intern confer to put pressur on the region power __PUNCT__
if we don't do those two thing __PUNCT__ i don't see a happi end to thi whole undertak __PUNCT__
we mai be forc into a posit where there no option __PUNCT__ at some point __PUNCT__ to withdraw and try to contain the chao __PUNCT__
the fact of the matter is that there is __PUNCT__ i am worri about __PUNCT__ my son get angri with thi __PUNCT__
my son unit mai get sent to iraq __PUNCT__ and if it doe __PUNCT__ he goe __PUNCT__
i don't want that to happen __PUNCT__
but if it happen __PUNCT__ it happen __PUNCT__
but i don't want my grandson go __PUNCT__
and how we leav iraq is go to determin not mere whether my son goe or not __PUNCT__ but whether my grandson goe __PUNCT__
so the idea of win and lose thi is the wrong languag __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__
it about salvag our interest __PUNCT__ or not salvag our interest __PUNCT__

elimin the __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ the tax break for invest on dividend and __PUNCT__ which is __MONEY__ billion is __PUNCT__ is __PUNCT__ is the cost of that __PUNCT__
and begin to do __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ on the crime side __PUNCT__ it point out in my crime bill for everi singl dollar we spent we save the public __MONEY__ dollar __PUNCT__

the place i start off with is somewher over __MONEY__ billion a year by the tax cut and end the war __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ all you need is __MONEY__ billion a year for the next five year to fund everi singl solitari aspect of the 9/11 commiss report __PUNCT__ and i would onli us __NUM__ of the __NUM__ billion from the top __NUM__ percent for that purpos __PUNCT__
