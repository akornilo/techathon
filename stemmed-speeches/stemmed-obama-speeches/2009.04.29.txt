first __PUNCT__ we ar continu to close monitor the emerg case of the h1n1 flu viru throughout the unit state __PUNCT__
as i said thi morn __PUNCT__ thi is obvious a veri seriou situat __PUNCT__ and everi american should know that their entir govern is take the utmost precaut and prepar __PUNCT__
our public health offici have recommend that school with confirm or suspect case of thi flu strongli consid temporarili close __PUNCT__
and if more school ar forc to close __PUNCT__ we recommend that both parent and busi think about conting plan if their children do have to stai home __PUNCT__
watch the entir new confer __PUNCT__
i request an immedi __MONEY__ billion in emerg fund from congress to support our abil to monitor and track thi viru and to build our suppli of antivir drug and other equip __PUNCT__
and we will also ensur that those materi get to where thei need to be as quickli as possibl __PUNCT__
you would take to prevent ani other flu __PUNCT__ keep your hand wash __PUNCT__ cover your mouth when you cough __PUNCT__ stai home from work if you sick __PUNCT__ and keep your children home from school if thei sick __PUNCT__
we continu to provid regular updat to the american peopl as we receiv more inform __PUNCT__
and everyon should rest assur that thi govern is prepar to do whatev it take to control the impact of thi viru __PUNCT__
the second thing i like to mention is how gratifi i am that the hous and the senat pass a budget resolut todai that will serv as an econom blueprint for thi nation futur __PUNCT__
i especi want to thank leader reid __PUNCT__ speaker pelosi __PUNCT__ all of the member of congress who work so quickli and effect to make thi blueprint a realiti __PUNCT__
thi budget build on the step we taken over the last __NUM__ dai to move thi economi from recess to recoveri and ultim to prosper __PUNCT__
we began by pass a recoveri act that ha alreadi save or creat over __NUM__ job and provid a tax cut to __NUM__ percent of all work famili __PUNCT__
we pass a law to provid and protect health insur for __NUM__ million american children whose parent work full time __PUNCT__
and we launch a hous plan that ha alreadi contribut to a spike in the number of homeown who ar refinanc their mortgag __PUNCT__ which is the equival of anoth tax cut __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ even as we clear awai the wreckag of thi recess __PUNCT__ i also said that we can't go back to an economi that built on a pile of sand __PUNCT__ on inflat home price and max __PUNCT__ out credit card __PUNCT__ on overleverag bank and outdat regul that allow reckless of a few to threaten the prosper of all __PUNCT__
we have to lai a new foundat for growth __PUNCT__ a foundat that will strengthen our economi and help us compet in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and that exactli what thi budget begin to do __PUNCT__
it contain new invest in educ that will equip our worker with the right skill and train __PUNCT__ new invest in renew energi that will creat million of job and new industri __PUNCT__ new invest in health care that will cut cost for famili and busi __PUNCT__ and new save that will bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
i also campaign on the promis that i would chang the direct of our nation foreign polici __PUNCT__
and we begun to do that __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
we begun to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we forg with our nato alli a new strategi to target al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
we have reject the fals choic between our secur and our ideal by close the detent center at guantanamo bai and ban tortur without except __PUNCT__
and we renew our diplomat effort to deal with challeng rang from the global econom crisi to the spread of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
so i think we off to a good start __PUNCT__ but it just a start __PUNCT__
i proud of what we achiev __PUNCT__ but i not content __PUNCT__
i pleas with our progress __PUNCT__ but i not satisfi __PUNCT__
million of american ar still without job and home __PUNCT__ and more will be lost befor thi recess is over __PUNCT__
credit is still not flow nearli as freeli as it should __PUNCT__
countless famili and commun touch by our auto industri still face tough time ahead __PUNCT__
our project long __PUNCT__ term deficit ar still too high __PUNCT__ and govern is still not as effici as it need to be __PUNCT__
we still confront threat rang from terror to nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ as well as pandem flu __PUNCT__
and all thi mean you can expect an unrel __PUNCT__ unyield effort from thi administr to strengthen our prosper and our secur in the second hundr dai __PUNCT__ in the third hundr dai __PUNCT__ and all of the dai after that __PUNCT__
you can expect us to work on health care reform that will bring down cost while maintain qualiti __PUNCT__ as well as energi legisl that will spark a clean __PUNCT__ energi revolut __PUNCT__
i expect to sign legisl by the end of thi year that set new rule of the road for wall street __PUNCT__ rule that reward drive and innov __PUNCT__ as oppos to short __PUNCT__ cut and abus __PUNCT__
and we will also work to pass legisl that protect credit card user from unfair rate hike and abus fee and penalti __PUNCT__
we continu scour the feder budget for save and target more program for elimin __PUNCT__
and we will continu to pursu procur reform that will greatli reduc the no __PUNCT__ bid contract that have wast so mani taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
so we have a lot of work left to do __PUNCT__
it work that will take time __PUNCT__ and it will take effort __PUNCT__
but the unit state of america __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ will see a better dai __PUNCT__
we will rebuild a stronger nation __PUNCT__ and we will endur as a beacon for all of those weari travel beyond our shore who still dream that there a place where all of thi is possibl __PUNCT__
i want to thank the american peopl for their support and their patienc dure these try time __PUNCT__ and i look forward to work with you in the next hundr dai __PUNCT__ in the hundr dai after that __PUNCT__ all of the hundr of dai to follow to make sure that thi countri is what it can be __PUNCT__
and with that __PUNCT__ i will start take some question __PUNCT__
and i start with you __PUNCT__ jennif __PUNCT__
question __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__
with the flu outbreak spread and worsen __PUNCT__ can you talk about whether you think it time to close the border with mexico and whether __PUNCT__ under what condit you might consid quarantin __PUNCT__ when that might be appropri __PUNCT__
obama __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ as i said __PUNCT__ thi is a caus for deep concern __PUNCT__ but not panic __PUNCT__
and i think that we have to make sure that we recogn that how we respond intellig __PUNCT__ systemat __PUNCT__ base on scienc and what public health offici have to sai __PUNCT__ will determin in larg part what happen __PUNCT__
i consult with our public health offici extens on a dai __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ dai basi __PUNCT__ in some case an hour __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ hour basi __PUNCT__
at thi point __PUNCT__ thei have not recommend a border close __PUNCT__
from their perspect __PUNCT__ it would be akin to close the barn door after the hors ar out __PUNCT__ becaus we alreadi have case here in the unit state __PUNCT__
we have ramp up screen effort __PUNCT__ as well as made sure that addit suppli ar there on the border so that we can prepar in the eventu that we have to do more than we do current __PUNCT__
but the most import thing right now that public health offici have indic is that we treat thi the same wai that we would treat other flu outbreak __PUNCT__ just understand that __PUNCT__ becaus thi is a new strain __PUNCT__ we don't yet know how it will respond __PUNCT__
so we have to take addit precaut __PUNCT__ essenti __PUNCT__ take out __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ so that we can make sure that everyth is in place should a worst __PUNCT__ case scenario plai out __PUNCT__
i do want to compliment democrat and republican who work dilig back in __NUM__ when the bird flu came up __PUNCT__
i wa part of a group of legisl who work with the bush administr to make sure that we had beef up our infrastructur and our stockpil of antivir drug __PUNCT__ like tamiflu __PUNCT__
and i think the bush administr did a good job of creat the infrastructur so that we can respond __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ we got __NUM__ million cours of anti __PUNCT__ viral drug in the event that thei need __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ the govern is go to be do everyth that we can __PUNCT__
we coordin close with state and local offici __PUNCT__
secretari napolitano at the depart of homeland secur __PUNCT__ newli instal secretari sebeliu of health and human servic __PUNCT__ our act cdc director __PUNCT__ thei ar all on the phone on a daili basi with all public health offici across the state to coordin and make sure that there time report __PUNCT__ that if __PUNCT__ as new case come up __PUNCT__ that we abl to track them effect __PUNCT__ that we alloc resourc so that thei in place __PUNCT__
the kei now i think is to make sure that we maintain great vigil __PUNCT__ that everybodi respond appropri when case do come up __PUNCT__ and individu famili start take veri sensibl precaut that __PUNCT__ can make a huge differ __PUNCT__
so wash your hand when you shake hand __PUNCT__
cover your mouth when you cough __PUNCT__
i know it sound trivial __PUNCT__ but it make a huge differ __PUNCT__
if you ar sick __PUNCT__ stai home __PUNCT__
if your child is sick __PUNCT__ keep them out of school __PUNCT__
to __PUNCT__ if you ar feel certain flu symptom __PUNCT__ don't get on an airplan __PUNCT__ don't get on a __PUNCT__ ani system of public transport where you confin and you could potenti spread the viru __PUNCT__
so those ar the step that i think we need to take right now __PUNCT__
but understand that becaus thi is a new strain __PUNCT__ we have to be cautiou __PUNCT__
if thi wa a strain that we were familiar with __PUNCT__ then we might have to __PUNCT__ then i think we wouldn't see the kind of alert level that we see __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ with the world health organ __PUNCT__
ok __PUNCT__
let me speak to chrysler first becaus the clock is tick on chrysler come up with a plan __PUNCT__
i am actual veri hope __PUNCT__ more hope than i wa __NUM__ dai ago __PUNCT__ that we can see a resolut that maintain a viabl chrysler auto compani out there __PUNCT__
what we seen is the union have made enorm sacrific on top of sacrific that thei had previous made __PUNCT__
you now seen the major debt holder come up with a set of potenti concess that thei can live with __PUNCT__
all of that promis the possibl that you can get a fiat __PUNCT__ chrysler merger and that you have an ongo concern __PUNCT__
the detail have not yet been final __PUNCT__ so i don't know to jump the gun __PUNCT__
but i am feel more optimist than i wa about the possibl of that get done __PUNCT__
with respect to gm __PUNCT__ we go to have anoth __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
thei still in the process of present us with their plan __PUNCT__
but i alwai said that gm ha a lot of good product there and if thei can get through these difficult time __PUNCT__ and engag in some of the veri difficult choic that thei alreadi made __PUNCT__ that thei can emerg a strong __PUNCT__ competit __PUNCT__ viabl compani __PUNCT__
and that my goal in thi whole process __PUNCT__
i would love to get the u. __PUNCT__ govern out of the auto busi as quickli as possibl __PUNCT__
we have a circumst in which a bad recess compound some great weak alreadi in the auto industri __PUNCT__
and it wa my oblig and continu to be my oblig to make sure that ani taxpay dollar that ar in place to support the auto industri ar aim not at short __PUNCT__ term fix that continu these compani as ward of the state __PUNCT__ but rather institut the kind of restructur that allow them to be strongli competit in the futur __PUNCT__
i think we move in that direct __PUNCT__
prudent and appropri thing for chrysler to do to engag in the file that thei __PUNCT__ that receiv some notic a while back becaus thei had to prepar for possibl conting __PUNCT__
it not clear that thei go to have to us it __PUNCT__
the fact that the major debt __PUNCT__ holder appear readi to make concess mean that __PUNCT__ even if thei end up have to go through some sort of bankruptci __PUNCT__ it would be a veri quick type of bankruptci and thei could continu oper and emerg on the other side in a much stronger posit __PUNCT__
so my goal is to make sure that we got a strong __PUNCT__ viabl __PUNCT__ competit auto industri __PUNCT__
i think some tough choic ar be made __PUNCT__
there no deni that there signific hardship involv __PUNCT__ particularli for the worker and the famili in these commun __PUNCT__
and we go to be come behind whatev plan is in place to make sure that the feder govern is provid as much assist as we have to ensur that peopl ar land back on their feet __PUNCT__ even as we strengthen these core busi __PUNCT__
what i said __PUNCT__ and i will repeat __PUNCT__ is that waterboard violat our ideal and our valu __PUNCT__
i do believ that it is tortur __PUNCT__
i don't think that just my opinion __PUNCT__ that the opinion of mani who examin the topic __PUNCT__
and that why i put an end to these practic __PUNCT__
i am absolut convinc it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__ not becaus there might not have been inform that wa yield by these variou detaine who were subject to thi treatment __PUNCT__ but becaus we could have gotten thi inform in other wai __PUNCT__ in wai that were consist with our valu __PUNCT__ in wai that were consist with who we ar __PUNCT__
i wa struck by an articl that i wa read the other dai talk about the fact that the british dure world war ii __PUNCT__ when london wa be bomb to smithereen __PUNCT__ had __NUM__ or so detaine __PUNCT__
and churchil said __PUNCT__ we don't tortur __PUNCT__ when the entir british __PUNCT__ all of the british peopl were be subject to unimagin risk and threat __PUNCT__
and then the reason wa that churchil understood __PUNCT__ you start take short __PUNCT__ cut __PUNCT__ over time __PUNCT__ that corrod what __PUNCT__ what best in a peopl __PUNCT__
it corrod the charact of a countri __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and so i strongli believ that the step that we taken to prevent these kind of enhanc interrog techniqu will make us stronger over the long term and make us safer over the long term becaus it will put us in a __PUNCT__ in a posit where we can still get inform __PUNCT__
in some case __PUNCT__ it mai be harder __PUNCT__ but part of what make us __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ still a beacon to the world is that we ar will to hold true to our ideal even when it hard __PUNCT__ not just when it easi __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ it take awai a critic recruit tool that al qaeda and other terrorist organ have us to try to demon the unit state and justifi the kill of civilian __PUNCT__
and it make us __PUNCT__ it put us in a much stronger posit to work with our alli in the kind of intern __PUNCT__ coordin intellig activ that can shut down these network __PUNCT__
so thi is a decis that i veri comfort with __PUNCT__
and i think the american peopl over time will recogn that it is better for us to stick to who we ar __PUNCT__ even when we take on an unscrupul enemi __PUNCT__
i believ that waterboard wa tortur __PUNCT__
and i think that the __PUNCT__ whatev legal rational were us __PUNCT__ it wa a mistak __PUNCT__
i have read the document __PUNCT__
now thei have not been offici declassifi and releas __PUNCT__
and so i don't want to go to the detail of them __PUNCT__
but here what i can tell you __PUNCT__ that the public report and the public justif for these techniqu __PUNCT__ which is that we got inform from these individu that were subject to these techniqu __PUNCT__ doesn't answer the core question __PUNCT__
which is __PUNCT__ could we have gotten that same inform without resort to these techniqu __PUNCT__ and it doesn't answer the broader question __PUNCT__ ar we safer as a consequ of have us these techniqu __PUNCT__
so when i made the decis to releas these memo and when i made the decis to bar these practic __PUNCT__ thi wa base on consult with my entir nation secur team __PUNCT__ and base on my understand that ultim i will be judg as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief on how safe i keep the american peopl __PUNCT__
that the respons i wake up with and it the respons i go to sleep with __PUNCT__
and so i will do whatev is requir to keep the american peopl safe __PUNCT__
but i am absolut convinc that the best wai i can do that is to make sure that we ar not take short cut that undermin who we ar __PUNCT__
and there have been no circumst dure the cours of thi first __NUM__ dai in which i have seen inform that would make me second guess the decis that i have made __PUNCT__
ok __PUNCT__
i confid that we can make sure that pakistan nuclear arsen is secur __PUNCT__
primarili __PUNCT__ initi __PUNCT__ becaus the pakistani armi __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ recogn the hazard of those weapon fall into the wrong hand __PUNCT__
we got strong militari __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ militari consult and cooper __PUNCT__
i am grave concern about the situat in pakistan __PUNCT__ not becaus i think that thei immedi go to be overrun and the taliban would take over in pakistan __PUNCT__
i more concern that the civilian govern there right now is veri fragil and don't seem to have the capac to deliv basic servic __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ rule of law __PUNCT__ a judici system that work for the major of the peopl __PUNCT__
and so as a consequ __PUNCT__ it is veri difficult for them to gain the support and the loyalti of their peopl __PUNCT__
so we need to help pakistan help pakistani __PUNCT__
and i think that there a recognit increasingli on the part of both the civilian govern there and the armi that that is their biggest weak __PUNCT__
on the militari side __PUNCT__ you start to see some recognit just in the last few dai that the obsess with india as the mortal threat to pakistan ha been misguid __PUNCT__ and that their biggest threat right now come intern __PUNCT__
and you start to see the pakistani militari take much more serious the arm threat from milit extremist __PUNCT__
we want to continu to encourag pakistan to move in that direct __PUNCT__
and we will provid them all of the cooper that we can __PUNCT__
we want to respect their sovereignti __PUNCT__ but we also recogn that we have huge strateg interest __PUNCT__ huge nation secur interest in make sure that pakistan is stabl and that you don't end up have a nuclear __PUNCT__ arm milit state __PUNCT__
i not go to engag in __PUNCT__ in hypothet of that sort __PUNCT__
i feel confid that that nuclear arsen will remain out of milit hand __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i think it import to note that __PUNCT__ although you seen some spectacular bomb in iraq that ar a __PUNCT__ a legitim caus of concern __PUNCT__ civilian death __PUNCT__ incid of bomb __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__ remain veri low rel to what wa go on last year __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__
and so you haven't seen the kind of huge spike that you were see for a time __PUNCT__
the polit system is hold and function in iraq __PUNCT__
part of the reason why i call for a gradual withdraw as oppos to a precipit on wa precis becaus more work need to be done on the polit side to further isol whatev remnant of al qaeda in iraq still exist __PUNCT__
and i veri confid that __PUNCT__ with our command on the ground __PUNCT__ gener odierno __PUNCT__ with chri hill __PUNCT__ our new ambassador __PUNCT__ have been approv and alreadi get hi team in place __PUNCT__ that thei ar go to be abl to work effect with the maliki govern to creat the condit for an ultim transfer after the nation elect __PUNCT__
but there some __PUNCT__ some seriou work to do on make sure that how thei divvi up oil revenu is ultim settl __PUNCT__ what the provinci power ar and boundari __PUNCT__ the relationship between the kurd and the central govern __PUNCT__ the relationship between the shia and the kurd __PUNCT__
ar thei incorpor effect sunni __PUNCT__ son of iraq __PUNCT__ into the structur of the arm forc in a wai that equit and just __PUNCT__
those ar all issu that have not been settl the wai thei need to be settl __PUNCT__
and what we done is __PUNCT__ we provid suffici time for them to get that work done __PUNCT__ but we got to keep the pressur up __PUNCT__ not just on the militari side __PUNCT__ but on the diplomat and develop side __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i think veri highli of arlen specter __PUNCT__
i think he got a record of legisl accomplish that is as good as ani member of the senat __PUNCT__
and i think he alwai had a strong independ streak __PUNCT__
i think that wa true when he wa a republican __PUNCT__ i think that will be true when he a democrat __PUNCT__
he wa veri blunt in sai i couldn't count on him to march lockstep on everi singl issu __PUNCT__
and so he go to still have strong opinion __PUNCT__ as mani democrat in the senat do __PUNCT__
i been there __PUNCT__
it turn out __PUNCT__ all the senat have veri strong opinion __PUNCT__
and i don't think that go to chang __PUNCT__
i do think that have arlen specter in the democrat caucu will liber him to cooper on critic issu __PUNCT__ like health care __PUNCT__ like infrastructur and job creation __PUNCT__ area where hi inclin were to work with us __PUNCT__ but he wa feel pressur not to __PUNCT__
and i think the vote on the recoveri act wa a classic exampl __PUNCT__
ultim __PUNCT__ he thought that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and he wa fierc berat within hi own parti at the time for have taken what i consid to be a veri sensibl step __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ so i think it __PUNCT__ overal __PUNCT__ posit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i am under no illus that suddenli i go to have a rubber __PUNCT__ stamp senat __PUNCT__
i got democrat who don't agre with me on everyth __PUNCT__ and that how it should be __PUNCT__
congress is a co __PUNCT__ equal branch of govern __PUNCT__
everi senat who there __PUNCT__ whether i agre with them or disagre with them __PUNCT__ i think truli believ that thei ar do their absolut best to repres their constitu __PUNCT__
and we got region differ __PUNCT__ and we got some part of the countri that ar affect differ by certain polici __PUNCT__
and those have to be respect __PUNCT__ and there go to have to be compromis and give __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ take on all of these issu __PUNCT__
i do think that __PUNCT__ to my republican friend __PUNCT__ i want them to realiz that me reach out to them ha been genuin __PUNCT__
i can't sort of defin bipartisanship as simpli be will to accept certain theori of their that we tri for eight year and didn't work and the american peopl vote to chang __PUNCT__
but there ar a whole host of area where we can work togeth __PUNCT__
and i said thi to peopl like mitch mcconnel __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ on health care reform __PUNCT__ you mai not agre with me that i __PUNCT__ we should have a public plan __PUNCT__
that mai be philosoph just too much for you to swallow __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ there ar some area like reduc the cost of medic malpractic insur where you do agre with me __PUNCT__
if i take some of your idea and give you credit for good idea __PUNCT__ the fact that you didn't get __NUM__ percent can't be a reason everi singl time to oppos my posit __PUNCT__
and if that is how bipartisanship is defin __PUNCT__ a situat in which basic __PUNCT__ wherev there ar philosoph differ __PUNCT__ i have to simpli go along with idea that have been reject by the american peopl in a histor elect __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we probabl not go to make progress __PUNCT__
if __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ the definit is that we open to each other idea __PUNCT__ there ar go to be differ __PUNCT__ the major will probabl be determin when it come to resolv just hard __PUNCT__ core differ that we can't resolv __PUNCT__ but there is a whole host of other area where we can work togeth __PUNCT__ then i think we can make progress __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ polit in america chang veri quick __PUNCT__
and i a big believ that thing ar never as good as thei seem and never as bad as thei seem __PUNCT__
you talk to a gui who wa __NUM__ point down in the poll dure a __PUNCT__ a primari in iowa __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ so i never __PUNCT__ i don't believ in crystal ball __PUNCT__
i do think that our administr ha taken some step that have restor confid in the american peopl that we move in the right direct and that simpli oppos our approach on everi front is probabl not a good polit strategi __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ my view on __PUNCT__ on abort __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ha been veri consist __PUNCT__
i think abort is a moral issu and an ethic issu __PUNCT__
i think that those who ar pro __PUNCT__ choic make a mistak when thei __PUNCT__ if thei suggest __PUNCT__ and i don't want to creat straw men here __PUNCT__ but i think there ar some who suggest that thi is simpli an issu about women freedom and that there no other consider __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ thi is an issu that peopl have to wrestl with and famili and individu women have to wrestl with __PUNCT__
the reason i pro __PUNCT__ choic is becaus i don't think women take that __PUNCT__ that posit casual __PUNCT__
i think that thei struggl with these decis each and everi dai __PUNCT__
and i think thei ar in a better posit to make these decis ultim than member of congress or a presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ in consult with their famili __PUNCT__ with their doctor __PUNCT__ with their doctor __PUNCT__ with their clergi __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ so that ha been my consist posit __PUNCT__
the other thing that i said consist dure the campaign is i would like to reduc the number of unwant presid that result in women feel compel to get an abort __PUNCT__ or at least consid get an abort __PUNCT__ particularli if we can reduc the number of teen pregnanc __PUNCT__ which ha start to spike up again __PUNCT__
and so i got a task forc within the domest polici council in the west wing of the white hous that is work with group both in the pro __PUNCT__ choic camp and in the pro __PUNCT__ life camp __PUNCT__ to see if we can arriv at some consensu on that __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the freedom of choic act is not highest legisl prioriti __PUNCT__
i believ that women should have the right to choos __PUNCT__
but i think that the most import thing we can do to tamp down some of the anger surround thi issu is to focu on those area that we can agre on __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ that where i go to focu __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__
ok __PUNCT__
surpris __PUNCT__
i am surpris compar to where i start __PUNCT__ when we first announc for thi race __PUNCT__ by the number of critic issu that appear to be come to a head all at the same time __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when i first start thi race __PUNCT__ iraq wa a central issu __PUNCT__ but the economi appear on the surfac to still be rel strong __PUNCT__
there were underli problem that i wa see with health care for famili and our educ system and colleg afford and so forth __PUNCT__ but obvious __PUNCT__ i didn't anticip the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the typic presid __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ ha two or three big problem __PUNCT__
we got seven or eight big problem __PUNCT__
and so we had to move veri quickli and i veri proud of my team for the fact that we been abl to keep our commit to the american peopl __PUNCT__ to bring about chang __PUNCT__ while at the same time manag a whole host of issu that had come up that weren't necessarili envis a year __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half ago __PUNCT__
troubl __PUNCT__ i sai less troubl __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ sober by the fact that chang in washington come slow __PUNCT__
that there is still a certain quotient of polit postur and bicker that take place even when we in the middl of realli big crise __PUNCT__
i would like to think that everybodi would sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ let take a time __PUNCT__ out on some of the polit game __PUNCT__ focu our attent for at least thi year __PUNCT__ and then we can start run for someth next year __PUNCT__
and that hasn't happen as much as i would have like __PUNCT__
enchant __PUNCT__ enchant __PUNCT__
i will tell you that when i __PUNCT__ when i meet our servicemen and __PUNCT__ women __PUNCT__ enchant is probabl not the word i would us __PUNCT__
but i am so profoundli impress and grate to them for what thei do __PUNCT__
thei realli good at their job __PUNCT__
thei ar will to make extraordinari sacrific on our behalf __PUNCT__
thei do so without complaint __PUNCT__
thei ar fierc loyal to thi countri __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the more i interact with our servicemen and women __PUNCT__ from the top brass down to the lowliest privat __PUNCT__ i just __PUNCT__ i grate to them __PUNCT__
humbl by the __PUNCT__ humbl by the fact that the presid is extraordinarili power __PUNCT__ but we ar just part of a much broader tapestri of american life __PUNCT__ and there ar a lot of differ power center __PUNCT__
and so i can't just press a button and suddenli have the banker do exactli what i want or __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ turn on a switch and suddenli __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ congress fall in line __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ what you do is to __PUNCT__ is to make your best argument __PUNCT__ listen hard to what other peopl have to sai __PUNCT__ and coax folk in the right direct __PUNCT__
thi metaphor ha been us befor __PUNCT__ but the ship of state is an ocean liner __PUNCT__
it not a speedboat __PUNCT__
and so the wai we ar constantli think about thi issu __PUNCT__ of how to bring about the chang that the american peopl need __PUNCT__ is to __PUNCT__ is to sai __PUNCT__ if we can move thi big battleship a few degre in a differ direct __PUNCT__ you mai not see all the consequ of that chang a week from now or three month from now __PUNCT__ but __NUM__ year from now or __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__ our kid will be abl to look back and sai __PUNCT__ that wa when we start get seriou about clean energi __PUNCT__
that when health care start to becom more effici and afford __PUNCT__
that when we becam seriou about rais our standard in educ __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and so i __PUNCT__ i have a much longer time horizon than i think you do when you a candid or if you listen __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ to the media reportag on a dai __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ dai basi __PUNCT__
and i humbl __PUNCT__ last __PUNCT__ by the american peopl who have shown extraordinari patienc and i think a recognit that we not go to solv all of these problem overnight __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we reach out to __PUNCT__ to senat mccain on a whole host of issu __PUNCT__
he ha been a leader on immigr reform __PUNCT__
i think he ha had the right posit on immigr reform __PUNCT__
and i would love to partner with him and other on what is go to be a critic issu __PUNCT__
we also work with senat mccain on what i think is a terrif piec of legisl that he and carl levin have put togeth around procur reform __PUNCT__
we want that move __PUNCT__ and we go to be work hard with them to get that accomplish __PUNCT__
what i told the congression hispan caucu is exactli what i said the veri next dai in a town hall meet and what i will continu to sai publicli __PUNCT__ and that is we want to move thi process __PUNCT__
we can't continu with a broken immigr system __PUNCT__
it not good for anybodi __PUNCT__
it not good for american worker __PUNCT__
it danger for mexican would __PUNCT__ be worker who ar try to cross a danger border __PUNCT__
it is __PUNCT__ it is put a strain on border commun __PUNCT__ who oftentim have to deal with a host of undocu worker __PUNCT__
and it keep those undocu worker in the shadow __PUNCT__ which mean thei can be exploit at the same time as thei depress u. __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ what i hope to happen is that we abl to conven a work group __PUNCT__ work with kei legisl like lui gutierrez and nydia velazquez and other to start look at a framework of how thi legisl might be shape __PUNCT__
in the meantim __PUNCT__ what we try to do is take some core __PUNCT__ some kei administr step to move the process along to lai the groundwork for legisl __PUNCT__
becaus the american peopl need some confid that if we actual put a packag togeth __PUNCT__ we can execut __PUNCT__
so janet napolitano __PUNCT__ who ha great knowledg of thi becaus of have been a border governor __PUNCT__ she alreadi in the process of review and figur out how can we strengthen our border secur in a much more signific wai than we do __PUNCT__
if the american peopl don't feel like you can secur the border __PUNCT__ then it hard to strike a deal that would get peopl out of the shadow and on a pathwai to citizenship who ar alreadi here __PUNCT__ becaus the attitud of the averag american is go to be __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you just go to have hundr of thousand of more come in each year __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ show that there is a more thought approach than just raid of a hand of worker as oppos to __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ take serious the violat of compani that sometim ar activ recruit these worker to come in __PUNCT__
that again someth we can start do administr __PUNCT__
so what we want to do is to show that we ar compet and get result around immigr __PUNCT__ even on the structur that we alreadi have in place __PUNCT__ the law that we alreadi have in place __PUNCT__ so that we build confid among the american peopl that we can actual follow through on whatev legisl approach emerg __PUNCT__
ok __PUNCT__
i see the process move thi first year __PUNCT__
and i go to be move it as quickli as i can __PUNCT__
i been accus of do too much __PUNCT__
we ar move full steam ahead on all front __PUNCT__
ultim __PUNCT__ i don't have control of the legisl calendar __PUNCT__ and so we go to work with legisl leader to see what we can do __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ keep in mind that everi step we take is design to help all peopl __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ folk who ar most vulner ar most like to be help becaus thei need the most help __PUNCT__
so when we pass the recoveri act __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ and we put in place provis that would extend unemploy insur or allow you to keep your health insur even if you lost your job __PUNCT__ that probabl disproportion impact those commun that had lost their job __PUNCT__
and unfortun __PUNCT__ the african __PUNCT__ american commun and the latino commun ar probabl overrepres in those rank __PUNCT__
when we put in place addit dollar for commun health center to ensur that peopl ar still get the help that thei need __PUNCT__ or we expand health insur to million more children through the children health insur program __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ those probabl disproportion impact african __PUNCT__ american and latino famili simpli becaus thei the on who ar most vulner __PUNCT__
thei have got higher rate of uninsur in their commun __PUNCT__
so my gener approach is that if the economi is strong __PUNCT__ that will lift all boat as long as it is also support by __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ strategi around colleg afford and job train __PUNCT__ tax cut for work famili as oppos to the wealthiest that level the plai field and ensur bottom __PUNCT__ up econom growth __PUNCT__
and i confid that that will help the african __PUNCT__ american commun live out the american dream at the same time that it help commun all across the countri __PUNCT__
i actual think that the state secret doctrin should be modifi __PUNCT__
i think right now it overbroad __PUNCT__
but keep in mind what happen __PUNCT__ is we come in to offic __PUNCT__
we in for a week __PUNCT__ and suddenli we got a court file that come up __PUNCT__
and so we don't have the time to effect think through __PUNCT__ what exactli should an overarch reform of that doctrin take __PUNCT__ we got to respond to the immedi case in front of us __PUNCT__
there __PUNCT__ i think it is appropri to sai that there ar go to be case in which nation secur interest ar genuin at stake and that you can't litig without reveal covert activ or classifi inform that would genuin compromis our safeti __PUNCT__
but search for wai to redact __PUNCT__ to carv out certain case __PUNCT__ to see what can be done so that a judg in chamber can review inform without it be in open court __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ there should be some addit tool so that it not such a blunt instrument __PUNCT__
and we interest in pursu that __PUNCT__
i know that eric holder and greg craig __PUNCT__ my white hous counsel __PUNCT__ and other ar work on that as we speak __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think our __PUNCT__ our first role should be sharehold that ar look to get out __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i don't want to run auto compani __PUNCT__
i don't want to run bank __PUNCT__
i got two war i got to run alreadi __PUNCT__
i got more than enough to do __PUNCT__
so the sooner we can get out of that busi __PUNCT__ the better off we go to be __PUNCT__
we ar in uniqu circumst __PUNCT__
you had the potenti collaps of the financi system __PUNCT__ which would have decim our economi __PUNCT__ and so we had to step in __PUNCT__
as i said befor __PUNCT__ i don't agre with everi decis that wa made by the previou administr when it came to tarp __PUNCT__ but the need for signific intervent wa there __PUNCT__ and it wa appropri that we move in __PUNCT__
with respect to the auto compani __PUNCT__ i believ that america should have a function __PUNCT__ competit auto industri __PUNCT__
i don't think that taxpay should simpli put __PUNCT__ attach an umbil cord between the u. __PUNCT__ treasuri and the auto compani so that thei ar constantli get subsidi __PUNCT__ but i do think that help them restructur at thi uniqu period when sale __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the market ha essenti gone from __NUM__ million down to __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ i don't think that there anyth inappropri about that __PUNCT__
my goal on all thi is to help these compani make some tough decis base on realist assumpt about econom growth __PUNCT__ about their market share __PUNCT__ about what that market is go to look like __PUNCT__ to prevent system risk that would affect everybodi __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as soon as their situat ar stabil and the economi is less fragil so that those system risk ar diminish __PUNCT__ to get out __PUNCT__ find some privat buyer __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__
i don't think that we should micromanag __PUNCT__ but i think that __PUNCT__ like ani investor __PUNCT__ the american taxpay ha the right to scrutin what be propos and make sure that their monei is not just be thrown down the drain __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we got to strike a balanc __PUNCT__
i don't want to be __PUNCT__ i not an auto engin __PUNCT__
i don't know how to creat an afford __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ design plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__
but i know that __PUNCT__ if the japanes can design an afford __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ design hybrid __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ doggon it __PUNCT__ the american peopl should be abl to do the same __PUNCT__
so my job is to ask the auto industri __PUNCT__ why is it you gui can't do thi __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ in some case __PUNCT__ thei start to do it __PUNCT__ but thei got these legaci cost __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ there ar some terrif u. __PUNCT__ car be made __PUNCT__ both by chrysler and g.m __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ give me a plan so that you build off your strength and you project out to where that market is go to be __PUNCT__
i actual think __PUNCT__ if you look at the trend __PUNCT__ that those auto compani that emerg from thi crisi __PUNCT__ when you start see the pent __PUNCT__ up demand for auto come back __PUNCT__ thei go to be in a posit to realli do well __PUNCT__ global __PUNCT__ not just here in the unit state __PUNCT__
so i just want to help them get there __PUNCT__
but i want to disabus peopl of thi notion that somehow we enjoi __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ meddl in the privat sector __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ if you could tell me right now that __PUNCT__ when i walk into thi offic that the bank were hum __PUNCT__ that auto were sell __PUNCT__ and that all you had to worri about wa iraq __PUNCT__ afghanistan __PUNCT__ north korea __PUNCT__ get health care pass __PUNCT__ figur out how to deal with energi independ __PUNCT__ deal with iran __PUNCT__ and a pandem flu __PUNCT__ i would take that deal __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and that why i alwai amus when i hear these __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ critic of __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ obama want to grow govern __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__
i would love a nice __PUNCT__ lean portfolio to deal with __PUNCT__ but that not the hand that been dealt us __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ everi gener ha to rise up to the specif challeng that confront them __PUNCT__
we happen to have gotten a big set of challeng __PUNCT__ but we not the first gener that that happen to __PUNCT__
and i confid that we ar go to meet these challeng just like our grandpar and forbear met them befor __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__
