what i am oppos to is a dumb war __PUNCT__

what i am oppos to is the cynic attempt by richard perl and paul wolfowitz and other armchair __PUNCT__ weekend warrior in thi administr to shove their own ideolog agenda down our throat __PUNCT__ irrespect of the cost in live lost and in hardship born __PUNCT__
what i am oppos to is the attempt by polit hack like karl rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsur __PUNCT__ a rise in the poverti rate __PUNCT__ a drop in the median incom __PUNCT__ to distract us from corpor scandal and a stock market that ha just gone through the worst month sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
