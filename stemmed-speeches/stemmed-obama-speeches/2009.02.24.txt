i know that for mani american watch right now __PUNCT__ the state of our economi is a concern that rise abov all other __PUNCT__ and rightli so __PUNCT__
if you haven't been person affect by thi recess __PUNCT__ you probabl know someon who ha __PUNCT__ a friend __PUNCT__ a neighbor __PUNCT__ a member of your famili __PUNCT__
you don't need to hear anoth list of statist to know that our economi is in crisi __PUNCT__ becaus you live it everi dai __PUNCT__
it the worri you wake up with and the sourc of sleepless night __PUNCT__
it the job you thought you retir from but now have lost __PUNCT__ the busi you built your dream upon that now hang by a thread __PUNCT__ the colleg accept letter your child had to put back in the envelop __PUNCT__
the impact of thi recess is real __PUNCT__ and it is everywher __PUNCT__
but while our economi mai be weaken and our confid shaken __PUNCT__ though we ar live through difficult and uncertain time __PUNCT__ tonight i want everi american to know thi __PUNCT__ we will rebuild __PUNCT__ we will recov __PUNCT__ and the unit state of america will emerg stronger than befor __PUNCT__
the weight of thi crisi will not determin the destini of thi nation __PUNCT__
the answer to our problem don't lie beyond our reach __PUNCT__
thei exist in our laboratori and our univers __PUNCT__ in our field and our factori __PUNCT__ in the imagin of our entrepreneur and the pride of the hardest __PUNCT__ work peopl on earth __PUNCT__
those qualiti that have made america the greatest forc of progress and prosper in human histori we still possess in ampl measur __PUNCT__
what is requir now is for thi countri to pull togeth __PUNCT__ confront boldli the challeng we face __PUNCT__ and take respons for our futur onc more __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if we honest with ourselv __PUNCT__ we admit that for too long we have not alwai met these respons __PUNCT__ as a govern or as a peopl __PUNCT__
i sai thi not to lai blame or to look backward __PUNCT__ but becaus it is onli by understand how we arriv at thi moment that we be abl to lift ourselv out of thi predica __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ our economi did not fall into declin overnight __PUNCT__
nor did all of our problem begin when the hous market collaps or the stock market sank __PUNCT__
we have known for decad that our surviv depend on find new sourc of energi __PUNCT__ yet we import more oil todai than ever befor __PUNCT__
the cost of health care eat up more and more of our save each year __PUNCT__ yet we keep delai reform __PUNCT__
our children will compet for job in a global economi that too mani of our school do not prepar them for __PUNCT__
and though all of these challeng went unsolv __PUNCT__ we still manag to spend more monei and pile up more debt __PUNCT__ both as individu and through our govern __PUNCT__ than ever befor __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ we have live through an era where too often short __PUNCT__ term gain were prize over long __PUNCT__ term prosper __PUNCT__ where we fail to look beyond the next payment __PUNCT__ the next quarter __PUNCT__ or the next elect __PUNCT__
a surplu becam an excus to transfer wealth to the wealthi instead of an opportun to invest in our futur __PUNCT__
regul __PUNCT__
regul __PUNCT__ regul were gut for the sake of a quick profit at the expens of a healthi market __PUNCT__
peopl bought home thei knew thei couldn't afford from bank and lender who push those bad loan anywai __PUNCT__
and all the while __PUNCT__ critic debat and difficult decis were put off for some other time on some other dai __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that dai of reckon ha arriv __PUNCT__ and the time to take charg of our futur is here __PUNCT__
now is the time to act boldli and wise __PUNCT__ to not onli reviv thi economi __PUNCT__ but to build a new foundat for last prosper __PUNCT__
now is the time to jump __PUNCT__ start job creation __PUNCT__ re __PUNCT__ start lend __PUNCT__ and invest in area like energi __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ and educ that will grow our economi __PUNCT__ even as we make hard choic to bring our deficit down __PUNCT__
that is what my econom agenda is design to do __PUNCT__ and that is what i like to talk to you about tonight __PUNCT__
it an agenda that begin with job __PUNCT__
as soon __PUNCT__
as soon as i took offic __PUNCT__ i ask thi congress to send me a recoveri plan by presid dai that would put peopl back to work and put monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ not becaus i believ in bigger govern __PUNCT__ i don't __PUNCT__ not becaus i not mind of the massiv debt we inherit __PUNCT__ i am __PUNCT__
i call for action becaus the failur to do so would have cost more job and caus more hardship __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ a failur to act would have worsen our long __PUNCT__ term deficit by assur weak econom growth for year __PUNCT__
and that why i push for quick action __PUNCT__
and tonight i am grate that thi congress deliv and pleas to sai that the american recoveri and reinvest act is now law __PUNCT__
over __PUNCT__ over the next two year __PUNCT__ thi plan will save or creat __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ percent of these job will be in the privat sector __PUNCT__ job rebuild our road and bridg __PUNCT__ construct wind turbin and solar panel __PUNCT__ lai broadband and expand mass transit __PUNCT__
becaus of thi plan __PUNCT__ there ar teacher who can now keep their job and educ our kid __PUNCT__
health care profession can continu care for our sick __PUNCT__
there ar __NUM__ polic offic who ar still on the street of minneapoli __PUNCT__ minnesota __PUNCT__ tonight becaus thi plan prevent the layoff their depart wa about to make __PUNCT__
becaus of thi plan __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of work household in america will receiv a tax cut __PUNCT__ a tax cut that you will see in your paycheck begin on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
becaus of thi plan __PUNCT__ famili who ar struggl to pai tuition cost will receiv a __MONEY__ tax credit for all four year of colleg __PUNCT__
and american __PUNCT__ and american who have lost their job in thi recess will be abl to receiv extend unemploy benefit and continu health care coverag to help them weather thi storm __PUNCT__
now i know there ar some in thi chamber and watch at home who ar skeptic of whether thi plan will work __PUNCT__ and i understand that skeptic __PUNCT__
here in washington __PUNCT__ we all seen how quickli good intent can turn into broken promis and wast spend __PUNCT__
and with a plan of thi scale come enorm respons to get it right __PUNCT__
and that why i ask vice presid biden to lead a tough __PUNCT__ unpreced oversight effort __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi mess with joe __PUNCT__
i have told each of my cabinet __PUNCT__ as well as mayor and governor across the countri __PUNCT__ that thei will be held account by me and the american peopl for everi dollar thei spend __PUNCT__
i appoint a proven and aggress inspector gener to ferret out ani and all case of wast and fraud __PUNCT__
and we have creat a new web site call __URL__ so that everi american can find out how and where their monei is be spent __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ the recoveri plan we pass is the first step in get our economi back on track __PUNCT__ but it is just the first step __PUNCT__ becaus even if we manag thi plan flawlessli __PUNCT__ there will be no real recoveri unless we clean up the credit crisi that ha sever weaken our financi system __PUNCT__
i want to speak plainli and candidli about thi issu tonight __PUNCT__ becaus everi american should know that it directli affect you and your famili well __PUNCT__ be __PUNCT__
you should also know that the monei you deposit in bank across the countri is safe __PUNCT__ your insur is secur __PUNCT__
you can reli on the continu oper of our financi system __PUNCT__ that not the sourc of concern __PUNCT__
the concern is that __PUNCT__ if we do not re __PUNCT__ start lend in thi countri __PUNCT__ our recoveri will be choke off befor it even begin __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economi __PUNCT__
the abil to get a loan is how you financ the purchas of everyth from a home to a car to a colleg educ __PUNCT__ how store stock their shelv __PUNCT__ farm bui equip __PUNCT__ and busi make payrol __PUNCT__
but credit ha stop flow the wai it should __PUNCT__
too mani bad loan from the hous crisi have made their wai onto the book of too mani bank __PUNCT__
and with so much debt and so littl confid __PUNCT__ these bank ar now fear of lend out ani more monei to household __PUNCT__ to busi __PUNCT__ or even to each other __PUNCT__
when there no lend __PUNCT__ famili can't afford to bui home or car __PUNCT__ so busi ar forc to make layoff __PUNCT__
our economi suffer even more __PUNCT__ and credit dri up even further __PUNCT__
that is why thi administr is move swiftli and aggress to break thi destruct cycl __PUNCT__ to restor confid __PUNCT__ and restart lend __PUNCT__
and we will do so in sever wai __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we ar creat a new lend fund that repres the largest effort ever to help provid auto loan __PUNCT__ colleg loan __PUNCT__ and small __PUNCT__ busi loan to the consum and entrepreneur who keep thi economi run __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ second __PUNCT__ we have launch a hous plan that will help respons famili face the threat of foreclosur lower their monthli payment and refin their mortgag __PUNCT__
it a plan that won't help specul or that neighbor down the street who bought a hous he could never hope to afford __PUNCT__ but it will help million of american who ar struggl with declin home valu __PUNCT__ american who will now be abl to take advantag of the lower interest rate that thi plan ha alreadi help to bring about __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the averag famili who refin todai can save nearli __MONEY__ per year on their mortgag __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we will act with the full forc of the feder govern to ensur that the major bank that american depend on have enough confid and enough monei to lend even in more difficult time __PUNCT__
and when we learn that a major bank ha seriou problem __PUNCT__ we will hold account those respons __PUNCT__ forc the necessari adjust __PUNCT__ provid the support to clean up their balanc sheet __PUNCT__ and assur the continu of a strong __PUNCT__ viabl institut that can serv our peopl and our economi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i understand that __PUNCT__ on ani given dai __PUNCT__ wall street mai be more comfort by an approach that give bank bailout with no string attach and that hold nobodi account for their reckless decis __PUNCT__ but such an approach won't solv the problem __PUNCT__
and our goal is to quicken the dai when we restart lend to the american peopl and american busi and end thi crisi onc and for all __PUNCT__
and i intend to hold these bank fulli account for the assist thei receiv __PUNCT__ and thi time thei will have to clearli demonstr how taxpay dollar result in more lend for the american taxpay __PUNCT__
thi time __PUNCT__ thi time __PUNCT__ ceo won't be abl to us taxpay monei to pad their paycheck __PUNCT__ or bui fanci drape __PUNCT__ or disappear on a privat jet __PUNCT__
those dai ar over __PUNCT__
still __PUNCT__ thi plan will requir signific resourc from the feder govern and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ probabl more than we alreadi set asid __PUNCT__
but while the cost of action will be great __PUNCT__ i can assur you that the cost of inact will be far greater __PUNCT__ for it could result in an economi that sputter along for not month or year __PUNCT__ but perhap a decad __PUNCT__
that would be wors for our deficit __PUNCT__ wors for busi __PUNCT__ wors for you __PUNCT__ and wors for the next gener __PUNCT__
and i refus to let that happen __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i understand that when the last administr ask thi congress to provid assist for struggl bank __PUNCT__ democrat and republican alik were infuri by the mismanag and the result that follow __PUNCT__
so were the american taxpay __PUNCT__ so wa i __PUNCT__
so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as help bank right now __PUNCT__ especi when everyon is suffer in part from their bad decis __PUNCT__
i promis you __PUNCT__ i get it __PUNCT__
but i also know that __PUNCT__ in a time of crisi __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the polit of the moment __PUNCT__
my job __PUNCT__ our job __PUNCT__ is to solv the problem __PUNCT__
our job is to govern with a sens of respons __PUNCT__
i will not send __PUNCT__ i will not spend a singl penni for the purpos of reward a singl wall street execut __PUNCT__ but i will do whatev it take to help the small busi that can't pai it worker or the famili that ha save and still can't get a mortgag __PUNCT__
that what thi is about __PUNCT__
it not about help bank __PUNCT__ it about help peopl __PUNCT__
it not about help bank __PUNCT__ it about help peopl __PUNCT__
becaus when credit is avail again __PUNCT__ that young famili can final bui a new home __PUNCT__
and then some compani will hire worker to build it __PUNCT__
and then those worker will have monei to spend __PUNCT__
and if thei can get a loan __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ mayb thei final bui that car or open their own busi __PUNCT__
investor will return to the market __PUNCT__ and american famili will see their retir secur onc more __PUNCT__
slowli __PUNCT__ but sure __PUNCT__ confid will return __PUNCT__ and our economi will recov __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ so i ask thi congress to join me in do whatev prove necessari __PUNCT__ becaus we cannot consign our nation to an open __PUNCT__ end recess __PUNCT__
and to ensur that a crisi of thi magnitud never happen again __PUNCT__ i ask congress to move quickli on legisl that will final reform our outdat regulatori system __PUNCT__
it is time __PUNCT__
it is time __PUNCT__
it is time to put in place tough __PUNCT__ new common __PUNCT__ sens rule of the road so that our financi market reward drive and innov and punish shortcut and abus __PUNCT__
the recoveri plan and the financi stabil plan ar the immedi step we take to reviv our economi in the short term __PUNCT__ but the onli wai to fulli restor america econom strength is to make the long __PUNCT__ term invest that will lead to new job __PUNCT__ new industri __PUNCT__ and a renew abil to compet with the rest of the world __PUNCT__
the onli wai thi centuri will be anoth american centuri is if we confront at last the price of our depend on oil and the high cost of health care __PUNCT__ the school that aren't prepar our children and the mountain of debt thei stand to inherit __PUNCT__
that is our respons __PUNCT__
in the next few dai __PUNCT__ i will submit a budget to congress __PUNCT__
so often __PUNCT__ we come to view these document as simpli number on a page or a laundri list of program __PUNCT__
i see thi document differ __PUNCT__
i see it as a vision for america __PUNCT__ as a blueprint for our futur __PUNCT__
my budget doe not attempt to solv everi problem or address everi issu __PUNCT__
it reflect the stark realiti of what we inherit __PUNCT__ a trillion __PUNCT__ dollar deficit __PUNCT__ a financi crisi __PUNCT__ and a costli recess __PUNCT__
given these realiti __PUNCT__ everyon in thi chamber __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ will have to sacrific some worthi prioriti for which there ar no dollar __PUNCT__ and that includ me __PUNCT__
but that doe not mean we can afford to ignor our long __PUNCT__ term challeng __PUNCT__
i reject the view that sai our problem will simpli take care of themselv __PUNCT__ that sai govern ha no role in lai the foundat for our common prosper __PUNCT__ for histori tell a differ stori __PUNCT__
histori remind us that __PUNCT__ at everi moment of econom upheav and transform __PUNCT__ thi nation ha respond with bold action and big idea __PUNCT__
in the midst of civil war __PUNCT__ we laid railroad track from on coast to anoth that spur commerc and industri __PUNCT__
from the turmoil of the industri revolut came a system of public high school that prepar our citizen for a new ag __PUNCT__
in the wake of war and depress __PUNCT__ the gi bill sent a gener to colleg and creat the largest middl __PUNCT__ class in histori __PUNCT__
and a twilight struggl for freedom led to a nation of highwai __PUNCT__ an american on the moon __PUNCT__ and an explos of technolog that still shape our world __PUNCT__
in each case __PUNCT__ govern didn't supplant privat enterpris __PUNCT__ it catalyz privat enterpris __PUNCT__
it creat the condit for thousand of entrepreneur and new busi to adapt and to thrive __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that ha seen promis amid peril and claim opportun from ordeal __PUNCT__
now we must be that nation again __PUNCT__
that is why __PUNCT__ even as it cut back on program we don't need __PUNCT__ the budget i submit will invest in the three area that ar absolut critic to our econom futur __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ and educ __PUNCT__
it begin with energi __PUNCT__
we know the countri that har the power of clean __PUNCT__ renew energi will lead the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and yet it is china that ha launch the largest effort in histori to make their economi energi effici __PUNCT__
we invent solar technolog __PUNCT__ but we fallen behind countri like germani and japan in produc it __PUNCT__
new plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid roll off our assembl line __PUNCT__ but thei will run on batteri made in korea __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i do not accept a futur where the job and industri of tomorrow take root beyond our border __PUNCT__ and i know you don't __PUNCT__ either __PUNCT__
it is time for america to lead again __PUNCT__
thank to our recoveri plan __PUNCT__ we will doubl thi nation suppli of renew energi in the next three year __PUNCT__
we also made the largest invest in basic research fund in american histori __PUNCT__ an invest that will spur not onli new discoveri in energi __PUNCT__ but breakthrough in medicin __PUNCT__ in scienc and technolog __PUNCT__
we will soon lai down thousand of mile of power line that can carri new energi to citi and town across thi countri __PUNCT__
and we will put american to work make our home and build more effici so that we can save billion of dollar on our energi bill __PUNCT__
but to truli transform our economi __PUNCT__ to protect our secur and save our planet from the ravag of climat chang __PUNCT__ we need to ultim make clean __PUNCT__ renew energi the profit kind of energi __PUNCT__
so i ask thi congress to send me legisl that place a market __PUNCT__ base cap on carbon pollut and drive the product of more renew energi in america __PUNCT__
that what we need __PUNCT__
and to support __PUNCT__ to support that innov __PUNCT__ we will invest __MONEY__ billion a year to develop technolog like wind power and solar power __PUNCT__ advanc biofuel __PUNCT__ clean coal __PUNCT__ and more effici car and truck built right here in america __PUNCT__
speak of our auto industri __PUNCT__ everyon recogn that year of bad decis __PUNCT__ make and a global recess have push our automak to the brink __PUNCT__
we should not and will not protect them from their own bad practic __PUNCT__
but we ar commit to the goal of a re __PUNCT__ tool __PUNCT__ re __PUNCT__ imagin auto industri that can compet and win __PUNCT__
million of job depend on it __PUNCT__ score of commun depend on it __PUNCT__ and i believ the nation that invent the automobil cannot walk awai from it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ none of thi will come without cost __PUNCT__ nor will it be easi __PUNCT__
but thi is america __PUNCT__
we don't do what easi __PUNCT__
we do what necessari to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and for that same reason __PUNCT__ we must also address the crush cost of health care __PUNCT__
thi is a cost that now caus a bankruptci in america everi __NUM__ second __PUNCT__
by the end of the year __PUNCT__ it could caus __NUM__ million american to lose their home __PUNCT__
in the last eight year __PUNCT__ premium have grown four time faster than wage __PUNCT__
and in each of these year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million more american have lost their health insur __PUNCT__
it is on of the major reason why small busi close their door and corpor ship job oversea __PUNCT__
and it is on of the largest and fastest __PUNCT__ grow part of our budget __PUNCT__
given these fact __PUNCT__ we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold __PUNCT__
we can't afford to do it __PUNCT__
it time __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ we done more to advanc the caus of health care reform in the last __NUM__ dai than we done in the last decad __PUNCT__
when it wa dai old __PUNCT__ thi congress pass a law to provid and protect health insur for __NUM__ million american children whose parent work full __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__
our recoveri plan will invest in electron health record and new technolog that will reduc error __PUNCT__ bring down cost __PUNCT__ ensur privaci __PUNCT__ and save live __PUNCT__
it will launch a new effort to conquer a diseas that ha touch the life of nearli everi american __PUNCT__ includ me __PUNCT__ by seek a cure for cancer in our time __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and it make the largest invest ever in prevent care __PUNCT__ becaus that on of the best wai to keep our peopl healthi and our cost under control __PUNCT__
thi budget build on these reform __PUNCT__
it includ a histor commit to comprehens health care reform __PUNCT__ a down payment on the principl that we must have qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care for everi american __PUNCT__
it a commit
it a commit that paid for in part by effici in our system that ar long overdu __PUNCT__ and it a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the year to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there will be mani differ opinion and idea about how to achiev reform __PUNCT__
that why i bring togeth busi and worker __PUNCT__ doctor and health care provid __PUNCT__ democrat and republican to begin work on thi issu next week __PUNCT__
i suffer no illus that thi will be an easi process __PUNCT__
onc again __PUNCT__ it will be hard __PUNCT__
but i also know that nearli a centuri after teddi roosevelt first call for reform __PUNCT__ the cost of our health care ha weigh down our economi and our conscienc long enough __PUNCT__
so let there be no doubt __PUNCT__ health care reform cannot wait __PUNCT__ it must not wait __PUNCT__ and it will not wait anoth year __PUNCT__
the third challeng we must address is the urgent need to expand the promis of educ in america __PUNCT__
in a global economi __PUNCT__ where the most valuabl skill you can sell is your knowledg __PUNCT__ a good educ is no longer just a pathwai to opportun __PUNCT__
it is a prerequisit __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ three __PUNCT__ quarter of the fastest __PUNCT__ grow occup requir more than a high school diploma __PUNCT__ and yet just over half of our citizen have that level of educ __PUNCT__
we have on of the highest high school dropout rate of ani industri nation __PUNCT__ and half of the student who begin colleg never finish __PUNCT__
thi is a prescript for econom declin __PUNCT__ becaus we know the countri that out __PUNCT__ teach us todai will out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
that is why it will be the goal of thi administr to ensur that everi child ha access to a complet and competit educ __PUNCT__ from the dai thei ar born to the dai thei begin a career __PUNCT__
that is a promis we have to make to the children of america __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ we made a histor invest in educ through the econom recoveri plan __PUNCT__
we dramat expand earli childhood educ and will continu to improv it qualiti __PUNCT__ becaus we know that the most form learn come in those first year of life __PUNCT__
we made colleg afford for nearli __NUM__ million more student __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million __PUNCT__
and we have provid the resourc necessari to prevent pain cut and teacher layoff that would set back our children progress __PUNCT__
but we know that our school don't just need more resourc __PUNCT__ thei need more reform __PUNCT__
and that is why __PUNCT__
that is why thi budget creat new teacher __PUNCT__ new incent for teacher perform __PUNCT__ pathwai for advanc __PUNCT__ and reward for success __PUNCT__
we invest __PUNCT__ we invest in innov program that ar alreadi help school meet high standard and close achiev gap __PUNCT__
and we will expand our commit to charter school __PUNCT__
it __URL__ is our respons as lawmak and as educ to make thi system work __PUNCT__ but it is the respons of everi citizen to particip in it __PUNCT__
so tonight i ask everi american to commit to at least on year or more of higher educ or career train __PUNCT__
thi can be a commun colleg or a four __PUNCT__ year school __PUNCT__ vocat train or an apprenticeship __PUNCT__
but whatev the train mai be __PUNCT__ everi american will need to get more than a high school diploma __PUNCT__
and drop out of high school is no longer an option __PUNCT__
it not just quit on yourself __PUNCT__ it quit on your countri __PUNCT__
and thi countri need and valu the talent of everi american __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ that why we will support __PUNCT__ we will provid the support necessari for all young american to complet colleg and meet a new goal __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ america will onc again have the highest proport of colleg graduat in the world __PUNCT__
that is a goal we can meet __PUNCT__
that a goal we can meet __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever __PUNCT__ which is why __PUNCT__ if you ar will to volunt in your neighborhood or give back to your commun or serv your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure that you can afford a higher educ __PUNCT__
and to encourag a renew spirit of nation servic for thi and futur gener __PUNCT__ i ask congress to send me the bipartisan legisl that bear the name of sen __PUNCT__ orrin hatch __PUNCT__ as well as an american who ha never stop ask what he can do for hi countri __PUNCT__ sen __PUNCT__ edward kennedi __PUNCT__
these educ polici will open the door of opportun for our children __PUNCT__ but it is up to us to ensur thei walk through them __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ there is no program or polici that can substitut for a parent __PUNCT__ for a mother or father who will attend those parent __PUNCT__ teacher confer __PUNCT__ or help with homework __PUNCT__ or turn off the tv __PUNCT__ put awai the video game __PUNCT__ read to their child __PUNCT__
i speak to you not just as a presid __PUNCT__ but as a father __PUNCT__ when i sai that respons for our children educ must begin at home __PUNCT__
that is not a democrat issu or a republican issu __PUNCT__
that an american issu __PUNCT__
and there is __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ anoth respons we have to our children __PUNCT__ and that the respons to ensur that we do not pass on to them a debt thei cannot pai __PUNCT__
that is critic __PUNCT__
i agre __PUNCT__ absolut __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i know we can get some consensu in here __PUNCT__
with the deficit we inherit __PUNCT__ the cost of the crisi we face __PUNCT__ and the long __PUNCT__ term challeng we must meet __PUNCT__ it ha never been more import to ensur that __PUNCT__ as our economi recov __PUNCT__ we do what it take to bring thi deficit down __PUNCT__
that is critic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i proud that we pass a recoveri plan free of earmark __PUNCT__ and i want to pass a budget next year that ensur that each dollar we spend reflect onli our most import nation prioriti __PUNCT__
and yesterdai __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i held a fiscal summit where i pledg to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in offic __PUNCT__
my administr ha also begun to go line by line through the feder budget in order to elimin wast and ineffect program __PUNCT__
as you can imagin __PUNCT__ thi is a process that will take some time __PUNCT__ but we have alreadi identifi __MONEY__ trillion in save over the next decad __PUNCT__
in thi budget __PUNCT__ we will end educ program that don't work and end direct payment to larg agribusi that don't need them __PUNCT__
we elimin the no __PUNCT__ bid contract that have wast billion in iraq and __PUNCT__ and reform our defens budget so that we not pai for cold war __PUNCT__ era weapon system we don't us __PUNCT__
we will root out __PUNCT__ we will root out the wast and fraud and abus in our medicar program that doesn't make our senior ani healthier __PUNCT__
we will restor a sens of fair and balanc to our tax code by final end the tax break for corpor that ship our job oversea __PUNCT__
in order to save our children from a futur of debt __PUNCT__ we will also end the tax break for the wealthiest __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me be clear __PUNCT__
let me be absolut clear __PUNCT__ becaus i know you end up hear some of the same claim that roll back these tax break mean a massiv tax increas on the american peopl __PUNCT__
if your famili earn less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ a quarter __PUNCT__ million dollar a year __PUNCT__ you will not see your tax increas a singl dime __PUNCT__
i repeat __PUNCT__ not on singl dime __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ not a dime __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the recoveri plan provid a tax cut __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__ a tax cut __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ percent of work famili __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ these check ar on the wai __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ to preserv our long __PUNCT__ term fiscal health __PUNCT__ we must also address the grow cost in medicar and social secur __PUNCT__
