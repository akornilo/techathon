i often said that thi elect is a defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__
on major issu like the war in iraq or the warm of our planet __PUNCT__ the decis we make in __DATE__ and over the next few year will shape a gener __PUNCT__ if not a centuri __PUNCT__
nowher is that more true than when it come to our economi __PUNCT__
just todai __PUNCT__ we learn that __NUM__ job were lost last month alon __PUNCT__ the seventh straight month of job loss __PUNCT__ now total over __NUM__ job lost sinc the begin of thi year __PUNCT__
thi follow yesterdai new that in the last year __PUNCT__ wage and benefit fell further behind inflat than at ani time in over twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ ga price ar out of control __PUNCT__
food price ar soar __PUNCT__
if you lucki enough to have health care __PUNCT__ your copai __PUNCT__ deduct __PUNCT__ and premium ar skyrocket __PUNCT__
colleg is becom less afford __PUNCT__
and we seen more foreclosur than at ani time sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
back in the 1990 __PUNCT__ your incom grew by __MONEY__ and over the last sever year __PUNCT__ thei actual fallen by nearli __MONEY__
so for mani famili __PUNCT__ these anxieti ar get wors __PUNCT__ not better __PUNCT__
peopl ar start to lose faith in the american dream __PUNCT__ which is the idea that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can build a better life not just for yourselv but for your children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl feel like that dream is slip further out of reach __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ becaus america is suppos to be the place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
and a lot of peopl ar try __PUNCT__ but thei have a tough time make it __PUNCT__
part of it ha to do with chang in the wai our economi work __PUNCT__
over the last few decad __PUNCT__ revolut in technolog and commun have made it so that corpor can send good job wherev there an internet connect __PUNCT__
children in st __PUNCT__ petersburg aren't just grow up compet for good job with children in boston or chicago __PUNCT__ but with children in beij and bangalor __PUNCT__
but what we also have to rememb is that our econom problem aren't simpli due to chang in how our economi work __PUNCT__ and thei aren't just a normal part of the busi cycl __PUNCT__
thei also due to irrespons decis that were made on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
in recent year __PUNCT__ we have relearn the essenti truth that in the long run __PUNCT__ we cannot have a thrive wall street and a struggl main street __PUNCT__
when wage ar flat __PUNCT__ price ar rise __PUNCT__ and more american ar mire in debt __PUNCT__ the economi as a whole suffer __PUNCT__
when a reckless few game the system __PUNCT__ as we seen in thi hous crisi __PUNCT__ million suffer and we all affect __PUNCT__
when special interest put their thumb on the scale __PUNCT__ and distort the free market __PUNCT__ the peopl who compet by the rule come in last __PUNCT__
and when our govern fail to meet it oblig __PUNCT__ to provid sensibl oversight and stand on the side of work peopl and invest in their futur __PUNCT__ america pai a heavi price __PUNCT__
so we have a choic to make in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can either choos a new direct for our economi __PUNCT__ or we can keep do what we been do __PUNCT__
my oppon believ we on the right cours __PUNCT__
he said our economi ha made great progress these past eight year __PUNCT__
he embrac the bush econom polici and promis to continu them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ our countri and famili in florida cannot afford to keep do the same thing over and over again and expect a differ result __PUNCT__
that a gambl we just can't take __PUNCT__
it time for someth new __PUNCT__
it time to restor balanc and fair to our economi so it work for all american __PUNCT__
that why as presid __PUNCT__ i will put a middl class tax cut into the pocket of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker __PUNCT__ provid relief to struggl homeown __PUNCT__ and elimin incom tax for senior make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and i end tax break for compani that ship job oversea and give them to compani that creat good job here at home __PUNCT__
but you can't wait that long __PUNCT__
you need immedi relief __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i alreadi call for a stimulu packag on two differ occas thi year __PUNCT__ and much of what i propos ha pass in congress __PUNCT__
these effort have made some differ __PUNCT__
but with job loss mount __PUNCT__ price rise __PUNCT__ increas turbul in our financi system __PUNCT__ and a grow credit crunch __PUNCT__ we need to do more __PUNCT__
i discuss these issu with my top econom advis at a meet on mondai and we agre that the main risk we face todai is do too littl in the face of our grow econom troubl __PUNCT__
that why todai __PUNCT__ i announc a two __PUNCT__ part emerg plan to help struggl famili make end meet and get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
the first part of my plan is a __MONEY__ emerg energi rebat that could go out to famili as soon as thi fall __PUNCT__
thi rebat will be enough to offset the increas cost of ga for a work famili over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
or __PUNCT__ if you live in a state where it get veri cold in the winter __PUNCT__ it will be enough to cover the entir increas in your heat bill __PUNCT__
or you could us the rebat for ani of your other bill or even to pai down debt __PUNCT__
as we provid relief __PUNCT__ we must also be mind of the swell budget deficit __PUNCT__
that is why i am propos that we pai for thi rebat by tax the windfal profit of oil compani like exxon mobil __PUNCT__ a compani that announc yesterdai that it made nearli __MONEY__ billion last quarter __PUNCT__ more than ani u. __PUNCT__ corpor ha ever made in a singl quarter __PUNCT__
it time we us some of their record profit to help you pai record price __PUNCT__
the second part of my plan is a __MONEY__ billion stimulu to help jump __PUNCT__ start job creation and help local commun that ar struggl due to our econom downturn __PUNCT__
half of thi stimulu will go to state govern that ar face big budget shortfal __PUNCT__
when state govern ar forc to cut spend on essenti servic like polic or firefight __PUNCT__ it doesn't just undermin the safeti of our commun __PUNCT__ it make our econom problem even wors __PUNCT__
by offer __MONEY__ billion to state govern __PUNCT__ we can help ensur that thei don't have to let worker go or freez their salari or rais properti tax on famili who ar hurt __PUNCT__
and we can also help ensur that thei continu provid foreclosur counsel and other servic to help famili stai in their home in area that have been hard __PUNCT__ hit by our hous crisi __PUNCT__
we invest the other half of thi __MONEY__ billion in our nation infrastructur so we can creat new job and save over on million job that ar in danger of be cut __PUNCT__
with construct cost rise __PUNCT__ the highwai trust fund is face a deficit for the first time ever __PUNCT__ and that mean that current infrastructur project ar be delai and new on ar be postpon __PUNCT__
thi is part of the reason we lost __NUM__ job in the construct industri in recent year __PUNCT__
so what we do is replenish the trust fund and make a down __PUNCT__ payment on my plan to creat a nation infrastructur bank to rebuild our crumbl road and bridg __PUNCT__
we also invest some of thi monei to repair our crumbl school __PUNCT__ becaus that won't just help make sure our children ar get a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ it will spur job __PUNCT__ growth and boost our local economi __PUNCT__
now my oppon ha a veri differ econom philosophi __PUNCT__
he propos to cut the gasolin tax paid by the oil compani and trust that thei will pass on the save in the form of lower price at the pump __PUNCT__
it a plan that strip __MONEY__ billion from our highwai construct fund __PUNCT__ which mean we will lose over __NUM__ construct job __PUNCT__
and he also propos tax cut for corpor and the wealthiest american in the hope that a littl bit of it will trickl down to you __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i do not believ that give __MONEY__ billion in new tax cut to oil compani __PUNCT__ includ __MONEY__ billion to exxon __PUNCT__ mobil alon __PUNCT__ will creat ani job or save you ani monei __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ i believ america is at it strongest when our economi is grow from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
if we want relief for famili __PUNCT__ we should give relief to famili __PUNCT__
if we want to creat job __PUNCT__ we should do more to make work pai for ordinari american __PUNCT__
that what my plan doe __PUNCT__ becaus that how we bring america the chang we need right now __PUNCT__
but we have to do more than just provid short __PUNCT__ term relief __PUNCT__
we have to secur our long __PUNCT__ term prosper and strengthen america competit in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__
it won't happen overnight __PUNCT__
but i refus to accept that we cannot meet the challeng of our global economi __PUNCT__
i run for presid becaus i believ we can seiz our own econom destini __PUNCT__
but we do have a choic to make in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we can choos to go anoth four year without truli solv our energi crisi __PUNCT__ or we can make america energi independ so we less vulner to oil price shock and __MONEY__ a gallon ga __PUNCT__
we can build an american green energi sector by invest in renew energi like wind power __PUNCT__ solar power __PUNCT__ and the next gener biofuel __PUNCT__
and we can creat up to five million new green job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
that what we can choos to do in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can choos to go anoth four year with the same reckless fiscal polici that have bust our budget __PUNCT__ wreak havoc in our economi __PUNCT__ and mortgag our children futur on a mountain of debt __PUNCT__ or we can restor fiscal respons in washington by start to wind down a war in iraq that cost __MONEY__ billion a month __PUNCT__ by cut wast spend __PUNCT__ by shut corpor loophol and tax haven __PUNCT__ and by roll back the bush tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
we can go anoth four year with a broken health care system __PUNCT__ or we can sai that if we spend more monei on health care per capita than ani other nation on earth __PUNCT__ we shouldn't have __NUM__ million peopl without health care __PUNCT__
we shouldn't have famili go bankrupt just becaus thei got sick __PUNCT__
we shouldn't have busi struggl to stai afloat becaus thei can't afford rise health care cost __PUNCT__
we should be guarante health care for anyon who want it __PUNCT__ make it afford for anyon who need it __PUNCT__ and cut cost for busi and their worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill and condit __PUNCT__
and that what we do by the end of my first term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we can choos to stai mire in the same educ debat that consum washington for decad __PUNCT__ or we can provid everi child with a qualiti educ so thei have the skill to succe in our global economi __PUNCT__
we can invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ recruit an armi of qualifi teacher with better pai and more support __PUNCT__ and final make colleg afford by offer an annual __MONEY__ tax credit in exchang for commun or nation servic __PUNCT__
america will invest in you __PUNCT__ you invest in america __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
these ar the choic we face in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ instead of talk about these real choic __PUNCT__ my oppon is run an increasingli neg campaign that distort my record and us the same old washington polit attack that ar trot out everi four year __PUNCT__
just yesterdai __PUNCT__ your own st __PUNCT__ petersburg time wrote that their campaign ha taken a __PUNCT__ nasti turn into the gutter __PUNCT__
the american peopl deserv better __PUNCT__
you deserv a seriou discuss about our nation challeng __PUNCT__
and you deserv real solut to our econom problem __PUNCT__ solut that will help ensur that here in thi countri __PUNCT__ opportun is open to anyon who will to work for it __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ that all most american ar ask for __PUNCT__
it not a lot __PUNCT__
you don't expect govern to solv all your problem __PUNCT__
you want to be self __PUNCT__ reliant and independ __PUNCT__
you want to be respons for your own live and take care of your own famili __PUNCT__
but what you do expect is a govern that isn't run by the special interest __PUNCT__
what you do expect is that if you will to work __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai a decent wage __PUNCT__ that you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ and that you should be abl to send your child to colleg even if you not rich __PUNCT__
you do expect that you should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
that what you should expect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and if you will to stand with me and work with me and vote for me __PUNCT__ then we will not just win florida __PUNCT__ we will win thi elect __PUNCT__ and then you and i togeth will chang thi countri and chang thi world __PUNCT__
