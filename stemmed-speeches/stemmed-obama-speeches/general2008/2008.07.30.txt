i often said that thi elect repres a defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__
on major issu like the war in iraq or the warm of our planet __PUNCT__ the decis we make in __DATE__ and over the next few year will shape a gener __PUNCT__ if not a centuri __PUNCT__
that is especi true when it come to our economi __PUNCT__
most of you probabl know thi __PUNCT__ not just becaus whenev you open the paper or turn on the tv __PUNCT__ you see report of more job loss __PUNCT__ more foreclosur __PUNCT__ and price rise at the pump __PUNCT__ but becaus you feel the effect of all thi everi singl dai __PUNCT__

you drive less and save less __PUNCT__
you struggl to balanc work and famili __PUNCT__
you worri about the valu of your home and whether you be abl to afford colleg for your kid and still retir at a decent ag __PUNCT__
for million of famili __PUNCT__ these anxieti seem to be grow wors with each pass dai __PUNCT__ caus mani peopl to lose faith in that fundament promis of america __PUNCT__ that no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ or what you look like __PUNCT__ or who your parent ar __PUNCT__ thi is a countri where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ part of the reason peopl ar struggl is due to fundament chang in our economi __PUNCT__
over the last few decad __PUNCT__ revolut in technolog and commun have made it so that corpor can send good job wherev there an internet connect __PUNCT__
children here in missouri aren't just grow up compet for good job with children in california or indiana __PUNCT__ but with children in china and india as well __PUNCT__
but what we also have to rememb is that it wasn't simpli global or a normal part of the busi cycl that got us where we ar todai __PUNCT__
it wa irrespons decis that were made on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
in the past few year __PUNCT__ we have relearn the essenti truth that in the long run __PUNCT__ we cannot have a thrive wall street and a struggl main street __PUNCT__
when wage ar flat __PUNCT__ price ar rise and more and more american ar mire in debt __PUNCT__ the economi as a whole suffer __PUNCT__
when a reckless few game the system __PUNCT__ as we seen in thi hous crisi __PUNCT__ million suffer and we all impact __PUNCT__
when special interest put their thumb too heavili on the scale __PUNCT__ and distort the free market __PUNCT__ those who compet by the rule come in last __PUNCT__
and when govern fail to meet it oblig __PUNCT__ to provid sensibl oversight and stand on the side of work peopl and invest in their futur __PUNCT__ america pai a heavi price __PUNCT__
so we have a choic to make in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can either choos a new direct for our economi __PUNCT__ or we can keep do what we been do __PUNCT__
my oppon believ we on the right cours __PUNCT__
he said our economi ha made great progress these past eight year __PUNCT__
he embrac the bush econom polici and promis to continu them __PUNCT__
our countri and the work famili of missouri cannot afford that __PUNCT__

but in thi elect __PUNCT__ we can do someth more than just provid short __PUNCT__ term relief __PUNCT__
we can secur our long __PUNCT__ term prosper and strengthen america competit in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__
it won't happen overnight __PUNCT__
but i refus to accept that we cannot meet the challeng of our global economi __PUNCT__
i run for presid becaus i believ we can choos our own econom destini __PUNCT__
we can choos to go anoth four year with the same reckless fiscal polici that have bust our budget __PUNCT__ wreak havoc in our economi __PUNCT__ and mortgag our children futur on a mountain of debt __PUNCT__ or we can restor fiscal respons in washington __PUNCT__
we can go anoth four year with a broken health care system that leav million uninsur __PUNCT__ drive million more to financi ruin __PUNCT__ and make it harder for manufactur to compet __PUNCT__ or we can final solv our health care crisi onc and for all __PUNCT__
we can guarante health care for anyon who want it __PUNCT__ make it afford for anyon who need it __PUNCT__ and cut cost for busi and their worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill and condit __PUNCT__

we can make sure that our trade agreement work for both wall street and main street __PUNCT__
and we can creat nearli two million job by invest in our crumbl infrastructur and build new school __PUNCT__ road __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__
and if anybodi tell you we can't afford to make these invest __PUNCT__ you just tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can invest some of that monei right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that what we can do in thi elect __PUNCT__
the choic is our __PUNCT__
we can go anoth four year without truli solv our energi crisi __PUNCT__ we can choos my oppon plan to give __MONEY__ billion in tax break to oil compani at a time when thei make record profit __PUNCT__ or we can final make america energi independ so that we less vulner to oil price shock and __MONEY__ a gallon ga __PUNCT__
we can invest in renew energi like wind power __PUNCT__ solar power __PUNCT__ and the next gener biofuel __PUNCT__
and we can creat up to five million new __PUNCT__ green job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
that what we can choos to do in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can choos to stai mire in the same educ debat that consum washington for decad __PUNCT__ or we can provid everi child with a world __PUNCT__ class educ so thei have the skill to compet and succe in our global economi __PUNCT__
we can invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ recruit an armi of qualifi teacher with better pai and more support __PUNCT__ and final make colleg afford by offer an annual __MONEY__ tax credit in exchang for commun or nation servic __PUNCT__
these ar the choic we face in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we can choos to remain on the path that gotten our economi into so much troubl __PUNCT__ or we can reclaim the idea that in thi countri __PUNCT__ opportun is open to anyon who will to work for it __PUNCT__
