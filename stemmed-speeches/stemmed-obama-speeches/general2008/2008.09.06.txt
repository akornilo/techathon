for gener __PUNCT__ we have work to keep a simpl promis in thi countri __PUNCT__ that those who have work hard their entir live have the right to retir with digniti and secur __PUNCT__
that is the promis my grandpar knew __PUNCT__
when my grandfath return from serv hi countri in world war ii __PUNCT__ he wa abl to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ bui their first hous with a loan from the feder govern __PUNCT__ and set out west from kansa to build their live with the confid that thei could reach a secur retir __PUNCT__
that is the promis that michel parent knew __PUNCT__
after her father pass awai __PUNCT__ her mother wa abl to live comfort due in part to hi pension as a shiftwork __PUNCT__
that wa the promis that fdr made __PUNCT__
and it wa a promis that washington kept for decad while folk like my grandpar and michel parent move through the up and down of middl __PUNCT__ class life __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ that promis feel like it slowli slip awai __PUNCT__
you feel thi in your own live __PUNCT__
more american ar out of work and more ar work harder for less __PUNCT__
more have lost their home and more ar watch their home valu plummet __PUNCT__
you pai colleg tuition that beyond your reach while support your ag parent __PUNCT__
and as you plan for your futur __PUNCT__ you find it harder to save and it harder to retir __PUNCT__
that becaus __PUNCT__ for eight long year __PUNCT__ there been a veri differ philosophi in the white hous __PUNCT__
thei call it the ownership societi __PUNCT__ but what it realli mean is you on your own __PUNCT__
job ship oversea __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__
pension disappear __PUNCT__ that the break __PUNCT__
no health care __PUNCT__ the emerg room will fix it __PUNCT__
you on your own __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let there be no doubt __PUNCT__
the republican nomine __PUNCT__ john mccain __PUNCT__ ha worn the uniform of our countri with braveri and distinct __PUNCT__ and for that we ow him our gratitud and respect __PUNCT__
but the record clear __PUNCT__ john mccain ha vote with georg bush __NUM__ percent of the time __PUNCT__
and i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but i not readi to take a __NUM__ percent chanc on chang __PUNCT__
and sinc he not offer much chang __PUNCT__ that why you didn't hear much about hi plan for the futur thi week __PUNCT__
you didn't hear much about their health care plan that would actual tax your benefit for the first time ever __PUNCT__ or about their plan that would privat social secur and gambl your retir __PUNCT__ or how thei plan to fix the economi thei ruin or help you live comfort in your later year __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ in the word of john mccain campaign manag __PUNCT__ thi elect __PUNCT__ isn't about the issu __PUNCT__
well i run for presid becaus i believ thi elect is all about the issu __PUNCT__
it not about me __PUNCT__ or john mccain __PUNCT__ it about you __PUNCT__
it about your live __PUNCT__
it about your futur __PUNCT__
and secur your futur start with protect social secur __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ tomorrow and forev __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ john mccain said that the wai social secur work is __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ an absolut disgrac __PUNCT__
wrong __PUNCT__
for million of american __PUNCT__ it the veri differ between a comfort retir and fall into poverti __PUNCT__
more than half of senior depend on it for more than half of their incom __PUNCT__
and as the first babi boomer becom elig for benefit thi year __PUNCT__ there ar step we can take to secur it futur for gener to come __PUNCT__
that doesn't mean embrac georg bush fail privat scheme __PUNCT__ as john mccain ha __PUNCT__
privat social secur wa a bad idea when georg bush propos it __PUNCT__ and it a bad idea todai __PUNCT__
it would take the on rock __PUNCT__ solid __PUNCT__ guarante part of your retir incom and gambl it on the stock market __PUNCT__
that why i stood with aarp against thi plan in the senat __PUNCT__ and that why i won't stand for it as presid __PUNCT__
but hi campaign ha gone even further __PUNCT__ suggest that the best answer to the grow pressur on social secur might be to cut cost __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ live adjust or rais the retir ag __PUNCT__
i will not do either __PUNCT__
there anoth option that is fairer to work men and women without put the burden on those who have alreadi earn it __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the social secur payrol tax is cap __PUNCT__
that mean most middl __PUNCT__ class famili pai thi tax on everi dime thei make __PUNCT__ while millionair and billionair onli pai it on a veri small percentag of their incom __PUNCT__
that why i work with member of congress from both parti to ask peopl make more than __MONEY__ a year to contribut a littl bit more to keep the system sound __PUNCT__
it a chang that would start a decad or more from now __PUNCT__ and it won't burden middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of american will see absolut no chang in their tax __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ even if we keep social secur strong for futur gener __PUNCT__ it still not enough to help senior on fix incom who ar struggl with the rise cost of everyth from ga to groceri __PUNCT__
that why i make retir more secur by elimin incom tax for retire make less than __MONEY__ per year __PUNCT__
thi would complet elimin incom tax for __NUM__ million senior __PUNCT__
and i will cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all work famili in thi countri __PUNCT__
now is the time to give the middl __PUNCT__ class a break __PUNCT__
now is the time to final provid afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__ becaus you shouldn't have to worri about be on ill awai from bankruptci __PUNCT__
if you like the health care you have __PUNCT__ you see lower premium under my plan __PUNCT__
if you don't have health care __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and as someon who watch my mother argu with insur compani while she lai in bed dy of cancer __PUNCT__ i will make certain those compani stop discrimin against those who ar sick and need care the most __PUNCT__
now is the time to also strengthen and preserv medicar __PUNCT__ and these reform will do just that __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ i will allow the govern to negoti with drug compani to lower cost for senior __PUNCT__ and we allow reimport of drug from other countri and ensur their safeti __PUNCT__ lower cost for all consum __PUNCT__
now is the time to help famili care for their ag parent by enact a real long __PUNCT__ term care plan that lower cost and guarante that all american receiv qualiti care in their later year __PUNCT__ to end the outrag of ceo cash out while worker watch their pension disappear __PUNCT__ to encourag save __PUNCT__ invest and wealth creation for our younger worker by enact automat workplac pension __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ these ar the polici i will pursu so that older american can continu live the longer __PUNCT__ better __PUNCT__ more product live that thei have everi right to expect __PUNCT__
aarp __PUNCT__ that how we renew american __PUNCT__ confid in a secur retir __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
but i need your help to make it happen __PUNCT__
so if you ok with the next four year look just like the last eight __PUNCT__ then i am not your candid __PUNCT__
but if you want chang __PUNCT__ if you want to restor that fundament promis we made from gener to gener __PUNCT__ then i ask you to give me your vote on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and if you do __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ we will chang thi countri togeth __PUNCT__
