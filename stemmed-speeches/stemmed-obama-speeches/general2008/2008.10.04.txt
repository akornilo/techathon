with just a month to go until elect dai __PUNCT__ i know you all been hear a lot about polit out here in virginia __PUNCT__
i know you been see a lot of ad __PUNCT__ and get a lot of call __PUNCT__ and read a lot about thi elect in the newspap __PUNCT__
but be here todai to talk with you about health care __PUNCT__ thi isn't about polit for me __PUNCT__
thi is person __PUNCT__
i think todai about my mother __PUNCT__
she di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
she fought valiantli __PUNCT__ and endur the pain and chemotherapi with grace and good humor __PUNCT__
but i never forget how she spent the final month of her life __PUNCT__
at a time when she should have been focus on get well __PUNCT__ at a time when she should have been take stock of her life and take comfort in her famili __PUNCT__ she wa ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei didn't want to cover her treatment __PUNCT__
thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
so i know someth about the heartbreak caus by our health care system __PUNCT__
i know someth about the anxieti of famili hang on by a thread as premium have doubl these past eight year __PUNCT__ and thei go into debt __PUNCT__ and more than half __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__ of all person bankruptci ar caus in part by medic bill __PUNCT__
i know about the frustrat of the nearli __NUM__ percent of small busi owner who can no longer afford to insur their employe __PUNCT__ folk who work dai and night __PUNCT__ but have to lai peopl off __PUNCT__ or shut their door for good __PUNCT__ becaus of rise health care cost __PUNCT__
i know the outrag we all feel about the __NUM__ million american who don't have health insur __PUNCT__ kid who can't see a doctor when thei sick __PUNCT__ parent cut their pill in half and prai for the best __PUNCT__ folk who wind up in the emerg room in the middl of the night becaus thei got nowher els to turn __PUNCT__
but i also know that thi is not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri where a young woman i met should have to work the night shift after a full dai of colleg and still not be abl to pai the medic bill for her sister who ill __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__ and it not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri where a man i met should have to file for bankruptci after he had a stroke __PUNCT__ becaus he face nearli __MONEY__ in medic cost that he couldn't afford and hi insur compani didn't cover __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__ and it not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri that reward hard work and persever with debt and worri __PUNCT__
we never been a countri that let major challeng go unsolv and unaddress __PUNCT__
and we ar tire of watch as year after year __PUNCT__ candid offer up detail health care plan with great fanfar and promis __PUNCT__ onli to see them crush under the weight of washington polit and drug and insur lobbi onc the campaign is over __PUNCT__
that is not who we ar __PUNCT__
and that is not who we have to be __PUNCT__
we know chang is possibl __PUNCT__
we seen it across thi countri as governor and legislatur move ahead of washington to pass bold health care initi on their own __PUNCT__
we see peopl across the spectrum __PUNCT__ doctor and patient __PUNCT__ union and busi __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ come togeth around thi issu __PUNCT__ becaus at a time when rise cost have put too mani famili and busi on a collis cours with financi ruin and left too mani without coverag at all __PUNCT__ thei know that bandaid and half __PUNCT__ measur just won't do __PUNCT__
now i know that at thi moment __PUNCT__ when we stand in the midst of a seriou econom crisi __PUNCT__ some might ask how we can afford to focu on health care __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let be clear __PUNCT__ the rescu packag we just pass in congress isn't the end of what we need to do to fix our economi __PUNCT__ it just the begin __PUNCT__
becaus the fundament of our economi ar still not strong __PUNCT__ contrari to what senat mccain sai __PUNCT__
and we got to address those fundament __PUNCT__ and address them right now __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ the question isn't how we can afford to focu on health care __PUNCT__ but how we can afford not to __PUNCT__
becaus in order to fix our econom crisi __PUNCT__ and rebuild our middl class __PUNCT__ we need to fix our health care system too __PUNCT__
let not forget __PUNCT__ it not just small busi and famili who ar struggl __PUNCT__
some of the largest corpor in america __PUNCT__ includ major american auto manufactur __PUNCT__ ar struggl to compet in the global marketplac becaus of high health care cost __PUNCT__
thei watch their foreign competitor prosper __PUNCT__ unburden by these cost __PUNCT__ as thei struggl to creat the good job we need to get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
so it clear that the time ha come __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to solv thi problem __PUNCT__ to cut health care cost for famili and busi __PUNCT__ and provid afford __PUNCT__ access health insur for everi american __PUNCT__
and you think that anyon run for presid would understand thi __PUNCT__
you think ani candid for the highest offic in the land would have a plan to achiev these critic import goal __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ if you think that __PUNCT__ you haven't met my oppon __PUNCT__ senat john mccain __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it not that he doesn't care about what peopl ar go through __PUNCT__
i just think he doesn't know __PUNCT__
that the onli reason i can think of that he propos a health care plan that is so radic __PUNCT__ so out of touch with what you face __PUNCT__ and so out of line with our basic valu __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha been eager to share some detail of hi plan __PUNCT__ but not all __PUNCT__
he tell you that he give you a tax credit of __MONEY__ per person __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__ to help you pai for your insur and health care cost __PUNCT__
but like those ad for prescript drug __PUNCT__ you have to read the fine print to learn the rest of the stori __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ senat mccain would pai for hi plan __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ by tax your health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__
and thi tax would come out of your paycheck __PUNCT__
but the new tax credit he propos __PUNCT__ that wouldn't go to you __PUNCT__
it would go directli to your insur compani __PUNCT__ not your bank account __PUNCT__
so when you read the fine print __PUNCT__ it clear that john mccain is pull an old washington bait and switch __PUNCT__
it a shell game __PUNCT__
he give you a tax credit with on hand __PUNCT__ but rais your tax with the other __PUNCT__
and recent __PUNCT__ after some forc question on tv __PUNCT__ he final admit that for some american __PUNCT__ those with the veri best plan __PUNCT__ hi tax increas will be higher than hi tax credit __PUNCT__ and thei come out behind __PUNCT__
john mccain call these plan __PUNCT__ cadillac plan __PUNCT__
in some case __PUNCT__ it mai be that a corpor ceo is get too good a deal __PUNCT__
but what if you a line worker make a good american car like cadillac who given up wage increas in exchang for better health care __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ senat mccain believ you should pai higher tax too __PUNCT__
the bottom line __PUNCT__ the better your health care plan __PUNCT__ the harder you fought for good benefit __PUNCT__ the higher the tax you pai under john mccain plan __PUNCT__
and here someth els senat mccain won't tell you __PUNCT__
when he tax peopl benefit __PUNCT__ mani younger __PUNCT__ healthier worker will decid that it a better deal to opt out of the insur thei get at work __PUNCT__ and instead __PUNCT__ go out into the individu market __PUNCT__ where thei can bui a cheaper plan __PUNCT__
mani employ will be left with an older __PUNCT__ sicker pool of worker who thei can't afford to cover __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ mani employ will drop their health care plan altogeth __PUNCT__
and studi after studi ha shown __PUNCT__ that under the mccain plan __PUNCT__ at least __NUM__ million american will lose the insur thei reli on from their workplac __PUNCT__
it the same approach georg w __PUNCT__ bush float a few year ago __PUNCT__
it wa dead on arriv in congress __PUNCT__
but if senat mccain were to succe where georg bush fail __PUNCT__ it veri well could be the begin of the end of our employ __PUNCT__ base health care system __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ some expert have said that that exactli the point of john mccain plan __PUNCT__ to drive you out of the insur you have through your employ __PUNCT__ and out into the marketplac __PUNCT__ where your famili will be given that __MONEY__ tax credit and told to bui insur on your own __PUNCT__
a __MONEY__ tax credit __PUNCT__
that sound pretti good __PUNCT__
but what senat mccain doesn't tell you is that the averag cost of a famili health care plan these dai is more than twice that much __PUNCT__ __MONEY__
so where would that leav you __PUNCT__
senat mccain also doesn't tell you that insur in the individu market isn't just more expens than insur you get through work __PUNCT__ it also includ fewer benefit __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ mani of these plan don't cover prescript drug or pre __PUNCT__ natal care __PUNCT__
mani don't cover give birth __PUNCT__ so you have to pai out of pocket for that __PUNCT__ roughli __MONEY__
so when you out there fend for yourself against the insur compani __PUNCT__ you pai more and get less __PUNCT__
here anoth thing senat mccain doesn't tell you __PUNCT__ hi plan won't do a thing to stop insur compani from discrimin against you if you have a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit like hypertens __PUNCT__ asthma __PUNCT__ diabet or cancer __PUNCT__ the kind of condit that __NUM__ million work ag american suffer from __PUNCT__ peopl from all background and walk of life all across thi countri __PUNCT__
employ don't charg you higher premium for these condit __PUNCT__ but insur do __PUNCT__ much higher __PUNCT__
so the sicker you been __PUNCT__ the more you have to pai __PUNCT__ and the harder it be to get the care you need __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ what john mccain doesn't tell you is that hi plan call for massiv deregul of the insur industri that would leav famili without the basic protect you reli on __PUNCT__
you mai have heard about how __PUNCT__ in the current issu of a magazin __PUNCT__ senat mccain wrote that we need to open up health care to __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ more vigor nationwid competit as we have done over the last decad in bank __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ he want to deregul the insur industri just like he fought to deregul the bank industri __PUNCT__
and we all seen how well that work out __PUNCT__
it would be equal catastroph for your health care __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ differ state have differ rule about what insur compani have to cover __PUNCT__
senat mccain plan would creat a deregul nation market where compani can cherri pick the state where thei base __PUNCT__ and sell plan anywher in america __PUNCT__
it the start gun for a race to the bottom __PUNCT__
insur compani will rush to set up shop in state with the fewest protect for patient __PUNCT__
state where thei don't have to cover thing like mammogram and other cancer screen __PUNCT__ vaccin __PUNCT__ matern care __PUNCT__ and mental health care __PUNCT__
state where you don't have a right to appeal when your hmo refus to cover the treatment you need __PUNCT__
these ar commonsens protect to make sure that you and your doctor __PUNCT__ not insur compani bureaucrat __PUNCT__ ar make decis about your health __PUNCT__
and john mccain want to give insur compani free reign to avoid them __PUNCT__
and believ it or not __PUNCT__ just to top it all off __PUNCT__ senat mccain plan to give the top ten largest insur compani __MONEY__ billion in new tax cut __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ anyon want to guess who run and fund john mccain campaign __PUNCT__ i give you a hint __PUNCT__
rememb when we tri to fix health care back in the 1990 __PUNCT__ and the insur compani spent million run mislead ad to scare peopl into oppos reform __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__ john mccain ha lobbyist for __NUM__ insur and drug compani and trade group advis hi campaign __PUNCT__ write hi polici __PUNCT__ and rais hi monei __PUNCT__
three of them ar hi top advisor __PUNCT__
and if you think that washington lobbyist who ar work dai and night to elect him ar do it to put themselv out of busi __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i got a bridg in alaska to sell you __PUNCT__
so here john mccain radic plan in a nutshel __PUNCT__ he tax health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ million lose the health care thei have __PUNCT__ million pai more for the health care thei get __PUNCT__ drug and insur compani continu to profit __PUNCT__ and middl class famili watch the system thei reli on begin to unravel befor their ey __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think that right __PUNCT__
i don't think we should settl for health care that work better for drug and insur compani than it doe for hard work american __PUNCT__
i don't think that the chang we need __PUNCT__
we can do better than that __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ it not surpris that senat mccain plan isn't a vast improv on the same fail polici of these past eight year __PUNCT__
rememb __PUNCT__ senat mccain vote against expand the children health insur program __PUNCT__ a program that provid health care for million of children in need __PUNCT__
he vote against protect medicar __NUM__ time over the cours of hi career __PUNCT__
and he support a massiv cut in medicar that would have rais premium and out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ pocket expens for senior while weaken the care thei depend on __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ senat mccain plan reflect the same bankrupt philosophi he subscrib to for the past three decad in washington __PUNCT__ take care of the healthi and wealthi __PUNCT__ and good luck to everyon els __PUNCT__
thei call thi the ownership societi __PUNCT__ but what it realli mean is __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
your job doesn't give you health care __PUNCT__ the market will fix it __PUNCT__
pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__
insur compani won't pai for your treatment __PUNCT__ too bad __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
thi approach hasn't work these past eight year __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__ and it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ i don't think govern can solv all our problem __PUNCT__
but i reject the radic idea that govern ha no role to plai in protect ordinari american __PUNCT__
i reject the think that sai preserv our free market mean let corpor and special interest do as thei pleas __PUNCT__
i know that noth is more import than the health and well __PUNCT__ be of the peopl you love __PUNCT__
and if you work hard and do everyth right __PUNCT__ you shouldn't live in fear of lose everyth becaus of a fluke of genet __PUNCT__ or a bad diagnosi __PUNCT__ or a stroke of bad luck __PUNCT__
that why i believ that everi singl american ha the right to afford __PUNCT__ access health care __PUNCT__ a right that should never be subject to washington polit or industri profit __PUNCT__ and that should never be purchas with tax increas on middl class famili __PUNCT__ becaus that is the last thing we need in an economi like thi __PUNCT__
i know we can do thi __PUNCT__
i know what we can accomplish when we come togeth __PUNCT__
i saw it in illinoi __PUNCT__ when as a state senat __PUNCT__ i brought republican and democrat togeth to pass legisl that ha expand coverag to more than __NUM__ peopl __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ children __PUNCT__
i help expand coverag for routin mammogram for women on medicaid __PUNCT__
and we creat hospit report card __PUNCT__ so that everi consum could see thing like the ratio of nurs to patient __PUNCT__ the number of annual medic error __PUNCT__ and the qualiti of care thei could expect at each hospit __PUNCT__
so i reject the tire old debat that sai we have to choos between two extrem __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ run health care with higher tax __PUNCT__ or insur compani without rule deni peopl coverag __PUNCT__
that a fals choic __PUNCT__
it the same distract rhetor that kept us gridlock for decad __PUNCT__
and we know that neither of these approach is the answer to thi problem __PUNCT__
the real solut is to take on drug and insur compani __PUNCT__ modern our health care system for the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri __PUNCT__ reduc cost for famili and busi __PUNCT__ and final provid afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi american __PUNCT__
and that what i intend to do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ it easi to have good idea and make big promis __PUNCT__
you all heard plenti of that these past __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
the hard part is come up with a concret __PUNCT__ detail plan __PUNCT__ and translat that plan into action __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ i want to take a few minut to tell you exactli what i plan to do __PUNCT__ how i get it done __PUNCT__ and how i go to pai for it __PUNCT__
we start by reduc premium by as much as __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__ and we do it by take the follow five step to lower cost throughout our health care system __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we take on the drug and insur compani and hold them account for the price thei charg and the harm thei caus __PUNCT__
we start by increas competit in the insur industri __PUNCT__ and outlaw insur compani discrimin against peopl with pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
insur compani spend __MONEY__ billion a year on elabor effort to cherri pick the healthiest patient and avoid cover everyon els __PUNCT__
i intend to save them a whole lot of time and monei by put an end to thi practic onc and for all __PUNCT__
and we tell the pharmaceut compani __PUNCT__ thank __PUNCT__ but no thank for the overpr drug __PUNCT__ drug that cost twice as much here as thei do in europ and canada __PUNCT__
we let medicar negoti for lower __PUNCT__ price __PUNCT__ we stop drug compani from block gener drug that ar just as effect __PUNCT__ and far less expens __PUNCT__ and we allow the safe re __PUNCT__ import of low __PUNCT__ cost drug from countri like canada __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we focu on prevent __PUNCT__ on promot well rather than just manag sick __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we spend less than four cent of everi health care dollar on prevent and public health __PUNCT__ even though __NUM__ percent of risk factor involv in the lead caus of death ar behavior __PUNCT__ relat __PUNCT__ and thu __PUNCT__ prevent __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ we make sure insur compani cover evid __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ prevent care servic __PUNCT__ weight loss program __PUNCT__ smoke __PUNCT__ cessat program __PUNCT__ and other effort to help peopl avoid costli __PUNCT__ debilit health problem in the first place __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we reduc wast and ineffici by move from a __NUM__ centuri health care system base on pen and paper to a __NUM__ centuri system base on the latest technolog __PUNCT__
accord to on studi __PUNCT__ just by transfer medic record from yellow page in file cabinet to electron record in comput __PUNCT__ we can save __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
and we can save live too by reduc deadli medic error and ensur that doctor and nurs spend less time with paperwork and more time with patient __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we reduc the cost of our care by improv the qualiti of our care __PUNCT__
it estim that poor qualiti care __PUNCT__ from medic error that caus complic to poor hygien practic that caus infect __PUNCT__ cost up to __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
so we provid you with inform about your hospit __PUNCT__ and provid __PUNCT__ qualiti of care __PUNCT__
we track which drug and procedur work best __PUNCT__
and we reward provid not just for the quantiti of servic thei provid __PUNCT__ but for the qualiti of outcom for their patient __PUNCT__
so you get better care __PUNCT__ and we all save monei in the long run __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ we reduc cost for busi and their worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the five percent of patient with the most seriou ill like cancer and heart diseas account for nearli fifti percent of health care cost __PUNCT__
insur compani devot the lion share of their expens to these patient __PUNCT__ and then pass the cost on to the rest of us in the form of higher premium __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ the feder govern will pai for part of these catastroph case __PUNCT__ which mean that your premium will go down __PUNCT__
so that how we cut cost __PUNCT__
but that not enough __PUNCT__
becaus todai __PUNCT__ in the year __NUM__ million american still don't have ani health insur at all __PUNCT__
thi is on of the great moral crise of our time __PUNCT__
and it creat a viciou cycl that affect everi last on of us __PUNCT__
as premium rise __PUNCT__ more peopl becom uninsur __PUNCT__
and everi time those uninsur folk walk into an emerg room becaus it their onli option __PUNCT__ insur compani rais premium to cover the cost __PUNCT__ a hidden tax of __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__
that extra cost mean even more peopl can't afford insur __PUNCT__ so the problem just get wors __PUNCT__
we cannot go on like thi __PUNCT__
thi is not who we ar __PUNCT__ and thi is not who we have to be __PUNCT__
that why my plan will cover all american __PUNCT__
and unlik senat mccain __PUNCT__ i do it by build on and strengthen __PUNCT__ rather than dismantl __PUNCT__ our current __PUNCT__ workplac __PUNCT__ base system __PUNCT__
so if you have insur you like __PUNCT__ you keep that insur __PUNCT__
if you have a doctor you like __PUNCT__ you keep that doctor __PUNCT__
the onli thing that chang for you is that your health care cost will go down __PUNCT__
but if you don't have insur __PUNCT__ or don't like your insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to choos from the same type of qualiti privat plan as everi feder employe __PUNCT__ from a postal worker here in colorado to a congressman in washington __PUNCT__
all of these plan will cover essenti medic servic includ prevent __PUNCT__ matern __PUNCT__ diseas manag and mental health care __PUNCT__
no on will be turn awai becaus of a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit or ill __PUNCT__
if you have children __PUNCT__ thei will be cover too __PUNCT__
if you chang job __PUNCT__ thi insur will go with you __PUNCT__
and if you can't afford thi insur __PUNCT__ you receiv a tax credit to help pai for it __PUNCT__
my plan also provid substanti help to small busi to cover their employe __PUNCT__
small busi ar america biggest job creator __PUNCT__ sinc __NUM__ compani with fewer than __NUM__ employe have creat __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of new job in america __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ too mani small busi ar sink under the weight of rise health care cost __PUNCT__
my health care plan won't impos a singl new burden on small busi __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we give them tax credit that will cover up to __NUM__ percent of the cost of insur their employe __PUNCT__
thi will help them creat not just new job __PUNCT__ but good job __PUNCT__ job with health care that stai right here in america __PUNCT__
and i want to be clear about exactli how i will pai for my plan __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i will aggress cut health care cost by reduc wast __PUNCT__ greed and paperwork __PUNCT__ lower the cost of prescript drug __PUNCT__ and elimin wast subsidi to privat plan in medicar __PUNCT__
that will save a lot __PUNCT__ but will still leav a cost of about __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
i cover that remain cost with a portion of the monei i save by end georg bush tax break for peopl make more than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
thei go back to pai similar rate to what thei paid when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
so we get thi done respons without blow a hole in our deficit __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ none of thi will be easi __PUNCT__
we up against a power __PUNCT__ entrench statu quo in washington that will sai anyth and do anyth and fight with everyth thei got to keep thing the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
but i know that if we come togeth __PUNCT__ and work togeth __PUNCT__ we can do thi __PUNCT__
so mani peopl ar count on us __PUNCT__
a woman name robyn who i met in florida __PUNCT__ is on of those peopl __PUNCT__
back in mai __PUNCT__ her __NUM__ year old son devon came to on of our event __PUNCT__ and i got to meet him at the airport in fort lauderdal __PUNCT__
later that dai __PUNCT__ devon becam serious ill __PUNCT__
hi heart start race __PUNCT__ and hi lip turn white __PUNCT__
he wa rush to the hospit and almost went into cardiac arrest __PUNCT__
he wa later diagnos with a heart condit and told he need a procedur that would cost ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
robyn insur compani refus to pai __PUNCT__ thei said it wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__ and robyn famili doesn't have that kind of monei __PUNCT__
but until devon ha that procedur __PUNCT__ he ha to take medic and stop all physic activ __PUNCT__
no more gym class __PUNCT__
no more footbal at school __PUNCT__
no more basketbal at the park with hi friend __PUNCT__
after we met __PUNCT__ robyn sent me an email in which she wrote __PUNCT__ my son deserv all that life ha to offer __PUNCT__
monei should never determin the qualiti of a child life __PUNCT__
i can't help but feel as if somehow we fail devon __PUNCT__
why couldn't we be the rich famili that ha the great insur or could whip out __NUM__ grand like it is noth __PUNCT__
she end her email with these word __PUNCT__ i ask onli thi of you __PUNCT__ on the dai where you feel so tire you can't think of utter anoth word to the peopl __PUNCT__ think of us __PUNCT__
on the dai when you ar plai basketbal __PUNCT__ think of devon __PUNCT__ who can't __PUNCT__
when those who oppos you have you down __PUNCT__ reach deep and fight back harder __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i want to sai to robyn and devon and everyon like them across america __PUNCT__ you have my word that i will never back down __PUNCT__ i will never give up __PUNCT__ i will never stop fight until we have fix our health care system and no famili ever ha to go through what you go through __PUNCT__ and my mother went through __PUNCT__ and so mani peopl go through everi dai in thi countri __PUNCT__
that is my promis to you __PUNCT__
and if all of you here todai will stand with me in thi work __PUNCT__ if you talk to your friend and neighbor __PUNCT__ get peopl to the poll __PUNCT__ and give me your vote __PUNCT__ then togeth __PUNCT__ we won't just win thi elect __PUNCT__ we will transform thi nation __PUNCT__
