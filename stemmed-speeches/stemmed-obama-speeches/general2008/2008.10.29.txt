north carolina __PUNCT__ i got two word for you __PUNCT__ six dai __PUNCT__
and you don't even have to wait six dai to vote __PUNCT__ you can vote earli right now __PUNCT__
but thi is import __PUNCT__ when you do vote __PUNCT__ you have to vote in two step __PUNCT__ on for presid __PUNCT__ and on for the rest of the ticket __PUNCT__
if you vote for a straight ticket __PUNCT__ you have not vote in the presidenti elect __PUNCT__
you need to vote for presid separ __PUNCT__
six dai __PUNCT__
after decad of broken polit in washington __PUNCT__ eight year of fail polici from georg bush __PUNCT__ and twenti __PUNCT__ on month of a campaign that ha taken us from the rocki coast of main to the sunshin of california __PUNCT__ we ar six dai awai from chang in america __PUNCT__
in six dai __PUNCT__ you can turn the page on polici that have put the greed and irrespons of wall street befor the hard work and sacrific of folk on main street __PUNCT__
in six dai __PUNCT__ you can choos polici that invest in our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ creat new job __PUNCT__ and grow thi economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up so that everyon ha a chanc to succe __PUNCT__ from the ceo to the secretari and the janitor __PUNCT__ from the factori owner to the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
in six dai __PUNCT__ you can put an end to the polit that would divid a nation just to win an elect __PUNCT__ that tri to pit region against region __PUNCT__ citi against town __PUNCT__ republican against democrat __PUNCT__ that ask us to fear at a time when we need hope __PUNCT__
in six dai __PUNCT__ at thi defin moment in histori __PUNCT__ you can give thi countri the chang we need __PUNCT__
we began thi journei in the depth of winter nearli two year ago __PUNCT__ on the step of the old state capitol in springfield __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ we didn't have much monei or mani endors __PUNCT__
we weren't given much of a chanc by the poll or the pundit __PUNCT__ and we knew how steep our climb would be __PUNCT__
but i also knew thi __PUNCT__
i knew that the size of our challeng had outgrown the small of our polit __PUNCT__
i believ that democrat and republican and american of everi polit stripe were hungri for new idea __PUNCT__ new leadership __PUNCT__ and a new kind of polit __PUNCT__ on that favor common sens over ideolog __PUNCT__ on that focus on those valu and ideal we hold in common as american __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ i believ in your abil to make chang happen __PUNCT__
i knew that the american peopl were a decent __PUNCT__ gener peopl who ar will to work hard and sacrific for futur gener __PUNCT__
and i wa convinc that when we come togeth __PUNCT__ our voic ar more power than the most entrench lobbyist __PUNCT__ or the most viciou polit attack __PUNCT__ or the full forc of a statu quo in washington that want to keep thing just the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
twenti __PUNCT__ on month later __PUNCT__ my faith in the american peopl ha been vindic __PUNCT__
that how we come so far and so close __PUNCT__ becaus of you __PUNCT__
that how we chang thi countri __PUNCT__ with your help __PUNCT__
and that why we can't afford to slow down __PUNCT__ sit back __PUNCT__ or let up for on dai __PUNCT__ on minut __PUNCT__ or on second in thi last week __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when so much is at stake __PUNCT__
we ar in the middl of the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
__NUM__ worker have lost their job thi year __PUNCT__
busi and famili can't get credit __PUNCT__
home valu ar fall __PUNCT__
pension ar disappear __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in a decad __PUNCT__ at a time when the cost of health care and colleg have never been higher __PUNCT__
it get harder and harder to make the mortgag __PUNCT__ or fill up your ga tank __PUNCT__ or even keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__
at a moment like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we can afford is four more year of the tire __PUNCT__ old theori that sai we should give more to billionair and big corpor and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
the last thing we can afford is four more year where no on in washington is watch anyon on wall street becaus politician and lobbyist kill common __PUNCT__ sens regul __PUNCT__
those ar the theori that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
thei haven't work __PUNCT__ and it time for chang __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha serv thi countri honor __PUNCT__
and he can point to a few moment over the past eight year where he ha broken from georg bush __PUNCT__ on tortur __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__
he deserv credit for that __PUNCT__
but when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ when it come to the central issu of thi elect __PUNCT__ the plain truth is that john mccain ha stood with thi presid everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
vote for the bush tax cut for the wealthi that he onc oppos __PUNCT__
vote for the bush budget that spent us into debt __PUNCT__
call for less regul twenti __PUNCT__ on time just thi year __PUNCT__
those ar the fact __PUNCT__
senat mccain sai that we can't spend the next four year wait for our luck to chang __PUNCT__ but you understand that the biggest gambl we can take is embrac the same old polici that have fail us for the last eight year __PUNCT__
we tri it john mccain wai __PUNCT__
we tri it georg bush wai __PUNCT__
it hasn't work __PUNCT__
deep down __PUNCT__ senat mccain know that __PUNCT__ which is why hi campaign said that __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
that why he spend these last few dai call me everi name in the book __PUNCT__
i sorri to see my oppon sink so low __PUNCT__
late __PUNCT__ he call me a socialist for want to roll back the bush tax cut for the wealthiest american so we can final give tax relief to the middl class __PUNCT__
by the end of the week __PUNCT__ he be accus me of be a secret communist becaus i share my toi in kindergarten __PUNCT__
that hi choic __PUNCT__
that the kind of campaign he chose to run __PUNCT__
but you have a choic too __PUNCT__
the fundament question in thi elect is not __PUNCT__ ar you better off than you were four year ago __PUNCT__ we know the answer to that __PUNCT__
the real question is __PUNCT__ will thi countri be better off four year from now __PUNCT__
for eight year __PUNCT__ we seen washington take care of the extrem well __PUNCT__ off and well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ and now my oppon is make the same old argument to justifi the same old polici that have been a complet failur for the middl class __PUNCT__
he want to give more to billionair __PUNCT__ more to corpor that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ more to the same peopl whose greed and irrespons got us into thi crisi __PUNCT__
we here becaus we know thei shouldn't get awai with it ani more __PUNCT__
we don't need anoth presid who fight for washington lobbyist and wall street __PUNCT__ we need a presid who stand up for hardwork american on main street __PUNCT__ and that what i be __PUNCT__
it time to think veri hard about what four year of john mccain polici will mean for the middl class __PUNCT__
if senat mccain is elect __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million american will not get a tax cut __PUNCT__
you won't see a cent __PUNCT__ but the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo will get __MONEY__ and big oil will get __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
if senat mccain is elect __PUNCT__ your health care benefit will get tax for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ and at least twenti million american risk lose their employ health insur __PUNCT__
if senat mccain is elect __PUNCT__ we have anoth presid who want to privat part of your social secur __PUNCT__
if senat mccain is elect __PUNCT__ he won't make your colleg tuition afford __PUNCT__
hi campaign sai thei have no colleg afford plan becaus thei consid the young peopl of america just anoth special interest __PUNCT__
whether you ar nanci the nurs __PUNCT__ tina the teacher __PUNCT__ or carl the construct worker __PUNCT__ if my oppon is elect __PUNCT__ you will be wors off four year from now than you ar todai __PUNCT__
so let cut through the neg ad and the phoni attack __PUNCT__ under john mccain __PUNCT__ the middl class will watch wealth get favor over work __PUNCT__ job get ship oversea __PUNCT__ and the cost of health care and colleg go through the roof __PUNCT__
north carolina __PUNCT__ we know that just won't do __PUNCT__
not thi time __PUNCT__
it time for chang __PUNCT__
it time to do what right for you __PUNCT__ for our economi __PUNCT__ and for our countri
i know that my oppon is worri about lose an elect __PUNCT__ but i worri about american who ar lose their home __PUNCT__ and their job __PUNCT__ and their life save __PUNCT__
i worri about the middl class __PUNCT__
and i won't just fight for your vote in the final dai of elect __PUNCT__ i will fight for you everi singl dai that i in the white hous __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so i can take six more dai of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but thi countri can't take four more year of the same old polit and the same fail polici __PUNCT__
it time for someth new __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time for america __PUNCT__
but i also know that we have face difficult time befor __PUNCT__
the american stori ha never been about thing come easi __PUNCT__ it been about rise to the moment when the moment wa hard __PUNCT__
it about see the highest mountaintop from the deepest of vallei __PUNCT__
it about reject fear and divis for uniti of purpos __PUNCT__
that how we overcom war and depress __PUNCT__
that how we won great struggl for civil right and women right and worker right __PUNCT__
and that how we emerg from thi crisi stronger and more prosper than we were befor __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
rememb __PUNCT__ we still have the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth __PUNCT__
we still home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and our research facil __PUNCT__
so there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
we just need a new direct __PUNCT__
we need a new polit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't believ that govern can or should try to solv all our problem __PUNCT__
i know you don't either __PUNCT__
but i do believ that govern should do that which we cannot do for ourselv __PUNCT__ protect us from harm and provid a decent educ for our children __PUNCT__ invest in new road and new scienc and technolog __PUNCT__
it should reward drive and innov and growth in the free market __PUNCT__ but it should also make sure busi live up to their respons to creat american job __PUNCT__ and look out for american worker __PUNCT__ and plai by the rule of the road __PUNCT__
it should ensur a shot at success not onli for those with monei and power and influenc __PUNCT__ but for everi singl american who will to work __PUNCT__
that how we creat not just more millionair __PUNCT__ but more middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__
that how we alwai grown the american economi __PUNCT__ from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
john mccain call thi social __PUNCT__
i call it opportun __PUNCT__ and there is noth more american than that __PUNCT__
understand __PUNCT__ if we want get through thi crisi __PUNCT__ we need to get beyond the old ideolog debat and divid between left and right __PUNCT__
we don't need bigger govern or smaller govern __PUNCT__
we need a better govern __PUNCT__ a more compet govern __PUNCT__ a govern that uphold the valu we hold in common as american __PUNCT__
we don't have to choos between allow our financi system to collaps and spend billion of taxpay dollar to bail out wall street bank __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will ensur that the financi rescu plan help stop foreclosur and protect your monei instead of enrich ceo __PUNCT__
and i will put in place the common __PUNCT__ sens regul i been call for throughout thi campaign so that wall street can never caus a crisi like thi again __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
the choic in thi elect isn't between tax cut and no tax cut __PUNCT__
it about whether you believ we should onli reward wealth __PUNCT__ or whether we should also reward the work and worker who creat it __PUNCT__
i will give a tax break to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of american who work everi dai and get tax taken out of their paycheck everi week __PUNCT__
i elimin incom tax for senior make under __MONEY__ and give homeown and work parent more of a break __PUNCT__
and i help pai for thi by ask the folk who ar make more than __MONEY__ a year to go back to the tax rate thei were pai in the 1990 __PUNCT__
no matter what senat mccain mai claim __PUNCT__ here ar the fact __PUNCT__ if you make under __MONEY__ you will not see your tax increas by a singl dime __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__
becaus the last thing we should do in thi economi is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
when it come to job __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect is not between put up a wall around america or allow everi job to disappear oversea __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ we won't be abl to bring back everi job that we lost __PUNCT__ but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain plan to keep give tax break to corpor that send american job oversea __PUNCT__
i will end those break as presid __PUNCT__ and i will give american busi a __MONEY__ tax credit for everi job thei creat right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i elimin capit gain tax for small busi and start __PUNCT__ up compani that ar the engin of job creation in thi countri __PUNCT__
we creat two million new job by rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ and school __PUNCT__ and by lai broadband line to reach everi corner of the countri __PUNCT__
and i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new energi job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and a new electr grid __PUNCT__ job build the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of tomorrow __PUNCT__ not in japan or south korea but here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ job that will help us elimin the oil we import from the middl east in ten year and help save the planet in the bargain __PUNCT__
that how america can lead again __PUNCT__
when it come to health care __PUNCT__ we don't have to choos between a govern __PUNCT__ run health care system and the unafford on we have now __PUNCT__
if you alreadi have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
and as someon who watch hi own mother spend the final month of her life argu with insur compani becaus thei claim her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__ i will stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
when it come to give everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ so thei can compet in thi global economi for the job of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ the choic is not between more monei and more reform __PUNCT__ becaus our school need both __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ pai them more __PUNCT__ and give them more support __PUNCT__
but i will also demand higher standard and more account from our teacher and our school __PUNCT__
and i will make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and when it come to keep thi countri safe __PUNCT__ we don't have to choos between retreat from the world and fight a war without end in iraq __PUNCT__
it time to stop spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq while the iraqi govern sit on a huge surplu __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will end thi war by ask the iraqi govern to step up __PUNCT__ and final finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorist who attack us on 9/11 __PUNCT__
i will never hesit to defend thi nation __PUNCT__ but i will onli send our troop into harm wai with a clear mission and a sacr commit to give them the equip thei need in battl and the care and benefit thei deserv when thei come home __PUNCT__
i will build new partnership to defeat the threat of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and i will restor our moral stand __PUNCT__ so that america is onc again that last __PUNCT__ best hope for all who ar call to the caus of freedom __PUNCT__ who long for live of peac __PUNCT__ and who yearn for a better futur __PUNCT__
i won't stand here and pretend that ani of thi will be easi __PUNCT__ especi now __PUNCT__
the cost of thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ and the cost of the war in iraq __PUNCT__ mean that washington will have to tighten it belt and put off spend on thing we can afford to do without __PUNCT__
on thi __PUNCT__ there is no other choic __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will go through the feder budget __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ end program that we don't need and make the on we do need work better and cost less __PUNCT__
but as i said from the dai we began thi journei all those month ago __PUNCT__ the chang we need isn't just about new program and polici __PUNCT__
it about a new polit __PUNCT__ a polit that call on our better angel instead of encourag our worst instinct __PUNCT__ on that remind us of the oblig we have to ourselv and on anoth __PUNCT__
part of the reason thi econom crisi occur is becaus we have been live through an era of profound irrespons __PUNCT__
on wall street __PUNCT__ easi monei and an ethic of __PUNCT__ what good for me is good enough __PUNCT__ blind greedi execut to the danger in the decis thei were make __PUNCT__
on main street __PUNCT__ lender trick peopl into bui home thei couldn't afford __PUNCT__
some folk knew thei couldn't afford those hous and bought them anywai __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ politician spent monei thei didn't have and allow lobbyist to set the agenda __PUNCT__
thei score polit point instead of solv our problem __PUNCT__ and even after the greatest attack on american soil sinc pearl harbor __PUNCT__ all we were ask to do by our presid wa to go out and shop __PUNCT__
that is why what we have lost in these last eight year cannot be measur by lost wage or bigger trade deficit alon __PUNCT__
what ha also been lost is the idea that in thi american stori __PUNCT__ each of us ha a role to plai __PUNCT__
each of us ha a respons to work hard and look after ourselv and our famili __PUNCT__ and each of us ha a respons to our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
that what been lost these last eight year __PUNCT__ our sens of common purpos __PUNCT__ of higher purpos __PUNCT__
and that what we need to restor right now __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ govern must lead the wai on energi independ __PUNCT__ but each of us must do our part to make our home and our busi more effici __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we must provid more ladder to success for young men who fall into live of crime and despair __PUNCT__
but all of us must do our part as parent to turn off the televis and read to our children and take respons for provid the love and guidanc thei need __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we can argu and debat our posit passion __PUNCT__ but at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridg our differ and unit in common effort __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ gai and straight __PUNCT__ disabl or not __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ we cannot afford the same polit game and tactic that ar be us to pit us against on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
the stake ar too high to divid us by class and region and background __PUNCT__ by who we ar or what we believ __PUNCT__
becaus despit what our oppon mai claim __PUNCT__ there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
there is no citi or town that is more pro __PUNCT__ america than anywher els __PUNCT__ we ar on nation __PUNCT__ all of us proud __PUNCT__ all of us patriot __PUNCT__
there ar patriot who support thi war in iraq and patriot who oppos it __PUNCT__ patriot who believ in democrat polici and those who believ in republican polici __PUNCT__
the men and women who serv in our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
it won't be quick __PUNCT__
but you and i know that it is time to come togeth and chang thi countri __PUNCT__
some of you mai be cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
a lot of you mai be disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what ha been ask of american throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ not just in my abil to bring about chang __PUNCT__ but in your __PUNCT__
i know thi chang is possibl __PUNCT__
becaus i have seen it over the last twenti __PUNCT__ on month __PUNCT__
becaus in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i have had the privileg to wit what is best in america __PUNCT__
i seen it in line of voter that stretch around school and church __PUNCT__ in the young peopl who cast their ballot for the first time __PUNCT__ and those not so young folk who got involv again after a veri long time __PUNCT__
i seen it in the worker who would rather cut back their hour than see their friend lose their job __PUNCT__ in the neighbor who take a stranger in when the floodwat rise __PUNCT__ in the soldier who re __PUNCT__ enlist after lose a limb __PUNCT__
i seen it in the face of the men and women i met at countless ralli and town hall across the countri __PUNCT__ men and women who speak of their struggl but also of their hope and dream __PUNCT__
i still rememb the email that a woman name robyn sent me after i met her in ft __PUNCT__ lauderdal __PUNCT__
sometim after our event __PUNCT__ her son nearli went into cardiac arrest __PUNCT__ and wa diagnos with a heart condit that could onli be treat with a procedur that cost ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
her insur compani refus to pai __PUNCT__ and their famili just didn't have that kind of monei __PUNCT__
in her email __PUNCT__ robyn wrote __PUNCT__ i ask onli thi of you __PUNCT__ on the dai where you feel so tire you can't think of utter anoth word to the peopl __PUNCT__ think of us __PUNCT__
when those who oppos you have you down __PUNCT__ reach deep and fight back harder __PUNCT__
north carolina __PUNCT__ that what hope is __PUNCT__ that thing insid us that insist __PUNCT__ despit all evid to the contrari __PUNCT__ that someth better is wait around the bend __PUNCT__ that insist there ar better dai ahead __PUNCT__
if we will to work for it __PUNCT__
if we will to shed our fear and our doubt __PUNCT__
if we will to reach deep down insid ourselv when we tire and come back fight harder __PUNCT__
hope __PUNCT__ that what kept some of our parent and grandpar go when time were tough __PUNCT__
what led them to sai __PUNCT__ mayb i can't go to colleg __PUNCT__ but if i save a littl bit each week my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but if i work realli hard my child can open on of her own __PUNCT__
it what led immigr from distant land to come to these shore against great odd and carv a new life for their famili in america __PUNCT__ what led those who couldn't vote to march and organ and stand for freedom __PUNCT__ that led them to cry out __PUNCT__ it mai look dark tonight __PUNCT__ but if i hold on to hope __PUNCT__ tomorrow will be brighter __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
that is the choic we face right now __PUNCT__
don't believ for a second thi elect is over __PUNCT__
don't think for a minut that power conced __PUNCT__
we have to work like our futur depend on it in thi last week __PUNCT__ becaus it doe __PUNCT__
in six dai __PUNCT__ we can choos an economi that reward work and creat new job and fuel prosper from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
