i often said that thi elect repres a defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__
on major issu like the war in iraq or the warm of our planet __PUNCT__ the decis we make in __DATE__ and over the next few year will shape a gener __PUNCT__ if not a centuri __PUNCT__
that is especi true when it come to our economi __PUNCT__
most of you alreadi know thi __PUNCT__ not just becaus you see headlin about job loss and foreclosur and recess __PUNCT__ but becaus you feel the effect of all thi in your own live __PUNCT__
you work harder than ever to pai bill that ar get bigger than ever and there not much left over at the end of the month __PUNCT__
you try to juggl the demand of work and famili __PUNCT__
you drive less and save less __PUNCT__
you worri about the valu of your home and whether you be abl to afford colleg for your kid and still retir at a decent ag __PUNCT__
for million of famili __PUNCT__ these everydai worri and long __PUNCT__ term anxieti have grown consider wors over the last year __PUNCT__
but thei ar root in fundament chang in our economi that began year earlier __PUNCT__
over the last few decad __PUNCT__ revolut in technolog and commun have made it so that corpor can send good job anywher in the world there an internet connect __PUNCT__
children in charlott aren't just compet for the same good job with children from boston __PUNCT__ but with children in bangalor and beij as well __PUNCT__
two __PUNCT__ incom famili haven't just becom more common __PUNCT__ thei becom a necess to keep up with rise cost and wage that haven't grown __PUNCT__
but as our world and our economi have chang __PUNCT__ onli washington ha stood still __PUNCT__
the progress we made dure the 1990 wa quickli revers by an administr with a singl philosophi that is as old as it is misguid __PUNCT__ reward not work __PUNCT__ not success __PUNCT__ but pure wealth __PUNCT__
give massiv tax break to big corpor and multimillionair and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
sacrific invest in health care and educ and energi and technolog to pai for these tax break __PUNCT__ and borrow the rest from countri like china __PUNCT__ leav our children to foot the bill __PUNCT__
well it painfulli clear by now how badli thi strategi ha fail __PUNCT__
and thi is a fundament issu in thi campaign __PUNCT__ becaus senat mccain and i have veri differ view of where our economi is todai __PUNCT__ and where we need to go __PUNCT__
senat mccain said earlier thi year that america ha made __PUNCT__ great progress econom __PUNCT__ over the past eight year __PUNCT__
he believ we on the right track __PUNCT__ and he launch a new econom tour todai with polici that ar veri much the same as those we have seen from the bush administr __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the central compon of senat mccain econom plan is __MONEY__ billion more in tax cut for big corpor and multimillionair __PUNCT__ less than a quarter of which will benefit the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of american famili that make up the bulk of our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
less than a quarter __PUNCT__
under senat mccain econom plan __PUNCT__ exxon mobil __PUNCT__ a compani that recent report the biggest profit in histori __PUNCT__ would get __MONEY__ billion in tax break __PUNCT__ while less than a quarter of the benefit would go to the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
what wors __PUNCT__ he ha no concret plan to pai for these tax break __PUNCT__ so hi polici would actual add more than __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ trillion to the nation debt over the next decad and weaken our economi even further __PUNCT__
if thi sound familiar __PUNCT__ it becaus it exactli what georg bush ha done for the last eight year __PUNCT__
it hasn't work __PUNCT__ it won't work __PUNCT__ and it is time to try someth new __PUNCT__
i won't stand here and pretend that we can or should undo the econom transform that have taken place over the last few decad __PUNCT__
there ar job that aren't come back and thi world will alwai be more competit __PUNCT__
but i do believ that if all of us ar will to share the burden and benefit of thi new economi __PUNCT__ then all of us will prosper __PUNCT__ not just becaus govern make it so __PUNCT__ but becaus we will to take respons as individu to work harder and think more and innov further __PUNCT__
i believ thi becaus i know that in america __PUNCT__ our prosper ha alwai risen from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
from the earliest dai of our found __PUNCT__ it ha been the hard work and ingenu of our peopl that serv as the wellspr of our econom strength __PUNCT__
that why we built a system of free public high school when we transit from a nation of farm to a nation of factori __PUNCT__
that why we sent my grandfath gener to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ which help creat the largest middl __PUNCT__ class in histori __PUNCT__
that why we invest in the scienc and research that have led to new discoveri and entir new industri __PUNCT__
and that what thi countri will do again when i am presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
the other week i laid out what america need to do to remain competit in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it an agenda that will requir us first and foremost to train and educ our workforc with the skill necessari to compet in a knowledg __PUNCT__ base economi __PUNCT__
we also need to place a greater emphasi on area like scienc and technolog that will defin the workforc of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and invest in the research and innov necessari to creat the job and industri of the futur right here in america __PUNCT__
on place where that invest would make an enorm differ is in a renew energi polici that end our addict on foreign oil __PUNCT__ provid real long __PUNCT__ term relief from high fuel cost __PUNCT__ and build a green economi that could creat up to five million well __PUNCT__ pai job that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
we can also creat million of new job by rebuild our school __PUNCT__ road __PUNCT__ bridg __PUNCT__ and other critic infrastructur that need repair __PUNCT__
and becaus we know that we can't or shouldn't put up wall around our economi __PUNCT__ a long __PUNCT__ term agenda will also find a wai to make trade work for american worker __PUNCT__
we do the caus of free __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ a caus i believ in __PUNCT__ no good when we pass trade agreement that hand out favor to special interest and do littl to help worker who have to watch their factori close down __PUNCT__
there is noth protectionist about demand that trade spread the benefit of global as broadli as possibl __PUNCT__
those ar the step we can take to grow our economi and stai competit as a nation __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ i want to talk about my plan to not onli ensur the econom secur of middl __PUNCT__ class famili in the short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ but to give them the chanc to achiev econom success in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ to make sure that american aren't just get by __PUNCT__ but get ahead __PUNCT__ that thei abl to get a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ build a nest egg and provid a better life for their children __PUNCT__
we can make thi new economi work for us if we final chang cours in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
the first step is to offer immedi relief to famili who ar struggl right now while help to jumpstart econom growth and creat job __PUNCT__
between a sluggish economi and ga price rise abov __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__ the american peopl cannot wait anoth six month for help __PUNCT__
instead of washington gimmick like a three __PUNCT__ month ga tax holidai that will onli pad oil compani profit __PUNCT__ we need to do what i call for month ago and pass a second stimulu packag that provid energi rebat check for work famili __PUNCT__ a fund to help famili avoid foreclosur __PUNCT__ and increas assist for state that have been hard __PUNCT__ hit by the econom downturn __PUNCT__
a few dai ago i call on senat mccain and all member of congress to come togeth __PUNCT__ republican and democrat __PUNCT__ in support of thi __MONEY__ billion stimulu packag __PUNCT__
there ar mani polici we disagre on __PUNCT__ but immedi relief for famili who ar struggl shouldn't be on of them __PUNCT__
and so while i haven't receiv a respons from senat mccain yet __PUNCT__ i look forward to hear on soon __PUNCT__
the second step in my agenda is to help provid econom secur for famili who been deal with skyrocket cost and stagnant wage for year __PUNCT__
i believ it time to reform our tax code so that it reward work and not just wealth __PUNCT__
so when i presid __PUNCT__ i shut down the corpor loophol and tax haven __PUNCT__ and i us the monei to help pai for a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut that will provid __MONEY__ of relief to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__
we also elimin incom tax for everi retire make less than __MONEY__ per year __PUNCT__ becaus everi senior deserv to live out their life in digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and if senat mccain want a debat about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__ that a debat i happi to have __PUNCT__
becaus if you a famili make less than __MONEY__ my plan will not rais your tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ not ani of your tax __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ what senat mccain should explain is why hi tax cut for the middl class would leav out __NUM__ million household __PUNCT__ and why __PUNCT__ for famili that ar lucki enough to get the tax cut __PUNCT__ it would be worth onli about __MONEY__ in the first year __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he trust that prosper will trickl down from corpor and the wealthiest few to everyon els __PUNCT__
i believ that it the hard work of middl __PUNCT__ class american that fuel thi nation prosper __PUNCT__
i also help famili who ar struggl under the crush burden of health care cost by pass a plan that bring the typic famili premium down by __MONEY__ and guarante coverag to everyon who want it __PUNCT__
senat mccain health care plan not onli fail to cover everi american and hold out less hope of cut health care cost __PUNCT__ it would actual tax your health care benefit for the first time ever __PUNCT__
over time thi tax would grow and after just a few year it would be so larg that middl __PUNCT__ class famili would face an overal tax increas from hi plan __PUNCT__
so that is a real choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
as we help famili deal with rise cost __PUNCT__ we also have to help those famili who find themselv mire in debt __PUNCT__
sinc so mani who ar struggl to keep up with their mortgag ar now shift their debt to credit card __PUNCT__ we have to make sure that credit card don't becom the next stage in the hous crisi becaus __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ we fail to establish basic rule and oversight to protect consum from predatori lend __PUNCT__
to make sure that american know what thei sign up for __PUNCT__ i institut a five __PUNCT__ star rate system to inform consum about the level of risk involv in everi credit card __PUNCT__
and we establish a credit card bill of right that will ban unilater chang to credit card agreement __PUNCT__ ban rate hike on debt you alreadi had __PUNCT__ and ban interest charg on late fee __PUNCT__
american need to pai what thei ow __PUNCT__ but you should pai what fair __PUNCT__ not just what fatten profit for some credit card compani and thei can get awai with __PUNCT__
the same principl should appli to our bankruptci law __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we reform our bankruptci law so that we give american who find themselv in debt a second chanc __PUNCT__
and we make sure that if you can demonstr that you went bankrupt becaus of medic expens __PUNCT__ you can reliev that debt and get back on your feet __PUNCT__
but even as we take these step __PUNCT__ we also know that it not enough to just get famili back on their feet __PUNCT__
we need to help hardwork famili get ahead __PUNCT__
we need to help the middl __PUNCT__ class succe becaus that when our economi succe __PUNCT__
that why the third step in my agenda is to give famili the help thei need to build that nest egg and provid a better life for their children __PUNCT__
to make save easier __PUNCT__ we automat enrol everi worker in a workplac pension plan that stai with you from job to job __PUNCT__
and for work famili who earn under __MONEY__ we will start that nest egg for you by match __NUM__ percent of the first __MONEY__ you save and deposit it directli into your account __PUNCT__
to make a colleg educ afford for everi american famili __PUNCT__ i make thi promis to everi student __PUNCT__ your countri will offer you __MONEY__ a year of tuition if you offer your countri commun or nation servic when you graduat __PUNCT__
if you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__
to make it easier for famili to own their own home and stai in that home __PUNCT__ we crack down on predatori lender __PUNCT__ and help more american refin their mortgag __PUNCT__ and provid ten million homeown a mortgag tax credit that will take ten percent off their interest rate __PUNCT__
to help those mother and father who ar juggl work and famili __PUNCT__ i expand the child care tax credit __PUNCT__ extend the famili medic leav act to give more parent more time with their children __PUNCT__ and make sure that everi worker in america ha access to seven dai of paid sick leav __PUNCT__
i make sure that women get equal pai for an equal dai work __PUNCT__ becaus that what right and that what famili need to get ahead __PUNCT__
and to help those famili who own small busi that ar the engin of prosper in america __PUNCT__ i will elimin all capit gain tax on start __PUNCT__ up and small busi to encourag more innov and job creation __PUNCT__
there is no doubt that thi agenda is ambiti __PUNCT__
it will take resourc in the wake of polici our debt like a war in iraq that cost us __MONEY__ billion a month __PUNCT__
but the answer to our fiscal problem is not to short __PUNCT__ chang invest that will help our famili get ahead __PUNCT__ invest that ar vital to our long __PUNCT__ term growth as a nation __PUNCT__
the answer is to make sure that we ar find a wai to pai for these invest but cut where we can __PUNCT__
my plan is detail and specif when it come to cut spend __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ all my new spend propos would be more than paid for by spend reduct __PUNCT__
i have a plan to respons end the war in iraq and reduc overpay for privat plan in medicar __PUNCT__ someth john mccain ha no specif plan to do __PUNCT__
i would also curb subsidi to bank make student loan __PUNCT__ return earmark to their __NUM__ level and reform no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__
i do thi becaus i believ we can have a smarter govern that pai it wai while invest in our countri futur __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ the american i met over the last sixteen month in town hall and live room __PUNCT__ on farm and front porch __PUNCT__ thei mai come from differ place and have differ background __PUNCT__ but thei hold common hope and dream the same simpl dream __PUNCT__
thei know govern can't solv all their problem __PUNCT__ and thei don't expect it to __PUNCT__
thei believ in person respons __PUNCT__ and hard work __PUNCT__ and self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__
thei don't like see their tax dollar wast __PUNCT__
but we also believ in fair and opportun __PUNCT__ in an america where job ar there for the will __PUNCT__ where hard work is reward with a decent live __PUNCT__ where no matter how much you start with or where you come from or who your parent ar __PUNCT__ you can not just get by __PUNCT__ but actual get ahead __PUNCT__
that the promis of thi countri __PUNCT__ and i believ we can keep that promis togeth if we chang cours and get to work in the month and year ahead __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
