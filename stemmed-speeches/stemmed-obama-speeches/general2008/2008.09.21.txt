the new of the dai isn't good __PUNCT__
the era of greed and irrespons on wall street and in washington ha led us to a peril moment __PUNCT__
thei said thei want to let the market run free but instead thei let it run wild __PUNCT__
and now we ar face a financi crisi as profound as ani we have face sinc the great depress
but here the truth __PUNCT__
regardless of how we got here __PUNCT__ we here todai __PUNCT__
and the circumst we face requir decis action becaus your job __PUNCT__ your save __PUNCT__ and your econom secur ar now at risk __PUNCT__
we must work quickli in a bipartisan fashion to resolv thi crisi to avert an even broader econom catastroph __PUNCT__
but washington also ha to recogn that econom recoveri requir that we act __PUNCT__ not just to address the crisi on wall street __PUNCT__ but also the crisi on main street and around kitchen tabl across america __PUNCT__
as of now __PUNCT__ the bush administr ha onli offer a concept with a stagger price tag __PUNCT__ not a plan __PUNCT__
even if the u. __PUNCT__ treasuri recov some or most of it invest over time __PUNCT__ thi initi outlai of up to __MONEY__ billion is sober __PUNCT__
and in return for their support __PUNCT__ the american peopl must be assur that the deal reflect the basic principl of transpar __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and reform __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ there must be no blank check when american taxpay ar on the hook for thi much monei __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ taxpay shouldn't be spend a dime to reward ceo on wall street __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ taxpay should be protect and should be abl to recoup thi invest __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ thi plan ha to help homeown stai in their home __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ thi is a global crisi __PUNCT__ and the unit state must insist that other nation join us in help secur the financi market __PUNCT__
sixth __PUNCT__ we need to start put in place the rule of the road i been call for for year to prevent thi from ever happen again __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ thi plan can't just be a plan for wall street __PUNCT__ it ha to be a plan for main street __PUNCT__
we have to come togeth __PUNCT__ as democrat and republican __PUNCT__ to pass a stimulu plan that will put monei in the pocket of work famili __PUNCT__ save job __PUNCT__ and prevent pain budget cut and tax hike in our state __PUNCT__
so i know these ar difficult dai __PUNCT__
but here what i also know __PUNCT__
i know we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
that what we alwai done as american __PUNCT__
our nation ha face difficult time befor __PUNCT__
and at each of those moment __PUNCT__ we risen to meet the challeng becaus we never forgotten that fundament truth __PUNCT__ that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ it written by us __PUNCT__
but anoth thing i know is thi __PUNCT__ we can't steer ourselv out of thi crisi by head in the same __PUNCT__ disastr direct __PUNCT__
and that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
becaus while i certainli don't fault senat mccain for all of the problem we face right now __PUNCT__ i do fault the econom philosophi he follow dure hi __NUM__ year in washington __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai it ok to turn a blind ey to practic that reward financi manipul instead of sound busi decis __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai even common __PUNCT__ sens regul ar unnecessari and unwis __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that let washington lobbyist shred consum protect and distort our economi so it work for the special interest instead of work peopl and our countri __PUNCT__
we now see the disastr consequ of thi philosophi all around us __PUNCT__ on wall street as well as main street __PUNCT__
and yet senat mccain __PUNCT__ who candidli admit not long ago that he doesn't know as much about econom as he should __PUNCT__ want to keep go down the same __PUNCT__ disastr path __PUNCT__
he call himself __PUNCT__ fundament a deregul __PUNCT__ when reckless deregul and lack of oversight is a big part of the problem __PUNCT__
and here the realli scari part __PUNCT__
now thi __PUNCT__ great deregul __PUNCT__ want to turn hi attent to health care __PUNCT__
he wrote in the current issu of a magazin __PUNCT__ the current issu __PUNCT__ that we need to open up health care to __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ more vigor nationwid competit __PUNCT__ as we have done over the last decad in bank __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ john mccain sai he want to do for health care what washington ha done for bank __PUNCT__
think about what that mean __PUNCT__
over the year __PUNCT__ state have come up with common sens rule to make sure that insur compani aren't just look out for their own profit __PUNCT__ but for your health __PUNCT__
and we cannot toss those rule out the window __PUNCT__
as anyon who ha health care know __PUNCT__ the on thing we don't need to do is give insur compani an even freer hand over what thei charg __PUNCT__ who thei cover __PUNCT__ and what thei cover __PUNCT__
the radic idea that govern ha no role to plai in protect ordinari american ha wreak havoc on our economi __PUNCT__
and we cannot let thi danger philosophi spread to health care __PUNCT__
what we seen over the last few dai is noth less than the final verdict on thi fail philosophi __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state becaus the dream of the american peopl must not be endang ani more __PUNCT__
the time ar too seriou __PUNCT__
the stake ar too high __PUNCT__
at thi moment __PUNCT__ in thi elect __PUNCT__ we need real chang __PUNCT__ chang that more than just a slogan __PUNCT__ chang that actual make a differ in peopl live __PUNCT__
and that the kind of chang i bring to washington when i presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that the chang the american peopl need __PUNCT__
chang mean a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyist who wrote it __PUNCT__ but the american worker and small busi who deserv it __PUNCT__
i will stop give tax break to corpor that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and i will start give them to compani that creat good job right here in america __PUNCT__
i will elimin capit gain tax for small busi and start __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ that how we grow our economi and creat the high __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
i will cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all work famili __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you will not see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i offer three time the tax relief for middl __PUNCT__ class famili as senat mccain doe __PUNCT__ becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
i will final keep the promis of afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
if you have health care __PUNCT__ my plan will lower your premium __PUNCT__
if you don't __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and i will stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care the most __PUNCT__
i will also creat the job of the futur by transform our energi economi __PUNCT__

and we will keep our promis to everi young american __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__
thi is the chang we need __PUNCT__ the kind of bottom up growth and innov that will advanc the american economi by advanc the dream of all american __PUNCT__
time ar hard __PUNCT__
i will not pretend that the chang we need will come without cost __PUNCT__ though i have present how we can achiev these chang in a fiscal respons wai __PUNCT__
i know that we have to overcom our doubt and divis and the determin opposit of power special interest befor we can truli reform a broken economi and advanc opportun __PUNCT__
but i am run for presid becaus we simpli cannot afford four more year of an econom philosophi that work for wall street instead of main street __PUNCT__ and end up devast both __PUNCT__
i don't want to wake up in four year to find that more american fell out of the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and more famili lost their save __PUNCT__
i don't want to see that our countri fail to invest in our abil to compet __PUNCT__ our children futur wa mortgag on anoth mountain of debt __PUNCT__ and our financi market fail to find a firmer foot __PUNCT__
at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ we have the chanc to final stand up and sai __PUNCT__ enough is enough __PUNCT__
