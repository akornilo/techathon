when i wa grow up __PUNCT__ nasa inspir the world with achiev we ar still proud of __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we have an administr that ha set ambiti goal for nasa without give nasa the support it need to reach them __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ thei had to cut back on research __PUNCT__ and trim their program __PUNCT__ which mean that after the space shuttl shut down in __NUM__ we go to have to reli on russian spacecraft to keep us in orbit __PUNCT__
we cannot cede our leadership in space __PUNCT__
that why i will help close the gap and ensur that our space program doesn't suffer when the shuttl goe out of servic by work with senat bill nelson to add at least on addit space shuttl flight beyond __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by support continu fund for nasa __PUNCT__ by speed the develop of the shuttl successor __PUNCT__ and by make sure that all those who work in the space industri in florida do not lose their job when the shuttl is retir __PUNCT__ becaus we cannot afford to lose their expertis __PUNCT__
more broadli __PUNCT__ we need a real vision for space explor __PUNCT__
to help formul thi vision __PUNCT__ i reestablish the nation aeronaut and space council so that we can develop a plan to explor the solar system __PUNCT__ a plan that involv both human and robot mission __PUNCT__ and enlist both intern partner and the privat sector __PUNCT__

that what we can choos to do in thi elect __PUNCT__

these ar the choic we face in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we can choos to remain on the path that ha led our economi into so much troubl __PUNCT__ or we can reclaim the idea that here in thi countri __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ that all most american ar ask for __PUNCT__

you don't expect govern to solv all your problem __PUNCT__
you want to be self __PUNCT__ reliant and independ __PUNCT__
you want to be respons for your own live and take care of your own famili __PUNCT__
