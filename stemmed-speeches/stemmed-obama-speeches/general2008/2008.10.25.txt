nevada __PUNCT__ in just __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ you have the chanc to elect your next presid __PUNCT__
and you have the chanc to bring the chang we need to washington __PUNCT__
that the good new __PUNCT__
but we go to have to work __PUNCT__ and struggl __PUNCT__ and fight for everi singl on of those __NUM__ dai to move our countri in a new direct __PUNCT__
we cannot let up __PUNCT__
and we won't __PUNCT__
becaus on thing we know is that chang never come without a fight __PUNCT__
in the final dai of campaign __PUNCT__ the sai __PUNCT__ anyth __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ anyth polit too often take over __PUNCT__
we seen it befor __PUNCT__
and we see it again todai __PUNCT__
the ugli phone call __PUNCT__
the mislead mail and tv ad __PUNCT__
the careless __PUNCT__ outrag comment __PUNCT__
all aim at keep us from work togeth __PUNCT__ all aim at stop chang __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thi isn't what we need right now __PUNCT__
the american peopl don't want to hear politician attack each other __PUNCT__ you want to hear about how we go to attack the challeng face middl class famili each and everi dai __PUNCT__
so what we need now is honest leadership and real chang __PUNCT__ and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
thi is a moment of great uncertainti for america __PUNCT__
the econom crisi we face is the worst sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
busi larg and small ar find it imposs to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip __PUNCT__ or hire new worker __PUNCT__ or even make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
we lost more than __NUM__ job thi year __PUNCT__ and unemploy here in nevada is up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thi year __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in a decad __PUNCT__ at a time when the cost of health care and colleg have never been higher __PUNCT__
it get harder and harder to make the mortgag __PUNCT__ or fill up your ga tank __PUNCT__ or even keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__
at thi rate __PUNCT__ the question isn't just __PUNCT__ ar you better off than you were four year ago __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ ar you better off than you were four week ago __PUNCT__
so what we need right now is a real debat about how to fix our economi and help middl class famili __PUNCT__
but that not what we get from the other side __PUNCT__
a coupl of week ago __PUNCT__ my oppon campaign said that __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__ so thei said thei be focus on attack me instead __PUNCT__
and that on campaign promis thei actual kept __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha been throw everyth he got at us __PUNCT__ hope someth will stick __PUNCT__
he even call me a socialist for suggest that we focu on tax cut __PUNCT__ not for corpor and the wealthi __PUNCT__ but for the middl class __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ the other dai __PUNCT__ he took it to a whole new level __PUNCT__
he said that i wa like georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
you can't make thi stuff up __PUNCT__ folk __PUNCT__
in what mai be the strangest twist of all __PUNCT__ senat mccain said that i would somehow continu the bush econom polici __PUNCT__ and that he __PUNCT__ john mccain __PUNCT__ would chang them __PUNCT__
he actual denounc the presid for let thing __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ get complet out of hand __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ john mccain ha been realli angri about georg bush econom polici __PUNCT__ except dure the primari __PUNCT__ when he said we made __PUNCT__ great progress econom __PUNCT__ under georg bush __PUNCT__
or just last month __PUNCT__ when he said that the __PUNCT__ fundament of our economi ar strong __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ john mccain is so oppos to georg bush polici __PUNCT__ that he vote with him __NUM__ percent of the time for the past eight year __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ he decid to realli stick it to him __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of the time __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let be clear __PUNCT__ john mccain attack georg bush for hi out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ hand econom polici is like dick chenei attack georg bush for hi go __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ alon foreign polici __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ presid bush doesn't seem to be at all offend __PUNCT__ becaus yesterdai __PUNCT__ he cast hi vote __PUNCT__ earli __PUNCT__ for senat mccain __PUNCT__
and that no surpris __PUNCT__ becaus when it come to the polici that matter for middl class famili __PUNCT__ there not an inch of daylight between georg bush and john mccain __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ john mccain want to keep give tax break to oil compani and ceo and compani that ship our job oversea __PUNCT__
it the same __PUNCT__ fail __PUNCT__ wall street first/main street last econom polici __PUNCT__ and we go to chang it __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ john mccain want to tax your health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ and let insur compani keep discrimin against peopl who need health care the most __PUNCT__
it the same __PUNCT__ fail __PUNCT__ insur compani first/your famili last health care polici __PUNCT__ and we go to chang it __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ john mccain want to privat social secur __PUNCT__ and leav it to the whim of the market __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ john mccain ignor thi hous crisi until it wa too late __PUNCT__ and then propos a __MONEY__ billion bailout for wall street bank that doe hardli anyth to help peopl stai in their home __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ he want less govern regul of busi __PUNCT__ he said it again just yesterdai __PUNCT__ the twenti __PUNCT__ first time he call for less regul just thi year __PUNCT__
now none of us want to see unnecessari burden on busi __PUNCT__
but after what we seen on wall street __PUNCT__ isn't it obviou by now that we need some commonsens rule of the road to protect consum and our economi __PUNCT__
i think we had enough of the bush __PUNCT__ mccain econom __PUNCT__
i can take ten more dai of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but the american peopl can't take four more year of the same fail polici and the same fail polit __PUNCT__
we not go to let georg bush pass the torch to john mccain __PUNCT__
it time for chang __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
i know folk ar worri __PUNCT__
but i believ that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi becaus i believ in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus i believ in you __PUNCT__
i believ in the american peopl __PUNCT__
we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with confid __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
but nevada __PUNCT__ i know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
not just the ceo __PUNCT__ but the secretari and the janitor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass the congress wa a necessari first step to eas thi credit crisi __PUNCT__ but if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ we need an immedi rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and that what i will do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i propos a new american job tax credit for each new employe that compani hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
i stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea and invest in compani that creat good job right here in nevada __PUNCT__
i help small busi get back on their feet by elimin capit gain tax and give them emerg loan to keep their door open and hire worker __PUNCT__
and i will creat a job and growth fund to help state and local govern save on million job and pai for health care and educ without have to rais your tax __PUNCT__
i also act quickli to help peopl stai in their home __PUNCT__ someth that especi critic here in nevada where foreclosur rate ar five time the nation averag __PUNCT__
i help respons homeown refin their mortgag on afford term __PUNCT__ and put in place a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur to give folk the breath room thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
and i won't let bank and lender off the hook when it wa their greed and irrespons that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
we should not be bail out wall street __PUNCT__ we should be restor opportun on main street __PUNCT__
these ar the step that we must take __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to start get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
but we also need a new set of prioriti to grow our economi and creat job over the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
it start with tax relief __PUNCT__
there been a lot of talk about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
and the truth is __PUNCT__ my oppon and i ar both propos tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to give a __MONEY__ tax cut to the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__
i want to put a middl class tax cut in the pocket of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
it true that i want to roll back the bush tax cut on the wealthiest american and go back to the rate thei paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
john mccain call that social __PUNCT__
what he forget is that just a few year ago __PUNCT__ he himself said those bush tax cut were irrespons __PUNCT__
he said he couldn't __PUNCT__ in good conscienc __PUNCT__ support a tax cut where the benefit went to the wealthi at the expens of __PUNCT__ middl class american who most need tax relief __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he wa right then __PUNCT__ and i am right now __PUNCT__
so let me be crystal clear __PUNCT__ if you make less than a quarter of a million dollar a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
that is my commit to you __PUNCT__
for the last eight year __PUNCT__ we have tri it john mccain wai __PUNCT__
we have tri it georg bush wai __PUNCT__
we given more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper would trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ it didn't __PUNCT__
so it time to try someth new __PUNCT__
it time to grow thi economi by invest in the middl class again __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix the problem in our health care system that we been talk about for too long __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
and if i presid __PUNCT__ we give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the skill and the knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and it mean make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
my oppon top econom advisor actual said that thei have no plan to invest in colleg afford becaus we can't have a giveawai to everi special interest __PUNCT__
well i don't think the young peopl of america ar a special interest __PUNCT__ thei ar the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i make thi deal with you __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
no if __PUNCT__ and or but __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ make no mistak __PUNCT__ the chang we need won't come easi or without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to tighten our belt __PUNCT__ we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
at a defin moment like thi __PUNCT__ we don't have the luxuri of reli on the same polit game and the same polit tactic that ar us everi elect to divid us from on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
with the challeng and crise we face right now __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to divid thi countri by class or region __PUNCT__ by who we ar or what polici we support __PUNCT__
there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
we ar not separ by the pro __PUNCT__ america and anti __PUNCT__ america part of thi nation __PUNCT__ we all love thi countri __PUNCT__ no matter where we live or where we come from __PUNCT__
there ar patriot who support thi war in iraq and patriot who oppos it __PUNCT__ patriot who believ in democrat polici and those who believ in republican polici __PUNCT__
the men and women from nevada and all across america who serv on our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we have alwai been at our best when we had leadership that call us to look past our differ and come togeth as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__ leadership that ralli thi entir countri to a common purpos __PUNCT__ to a higher purpos __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state of america becaus that is the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow the same divis and fear tactic and our own petti differ to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ to believ in yourselv __PUNCT__ in each other __PUNCT__ and in the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when we have a crisi to solv and an economi to save __PUNCT__
not when there ar so mani american without job and without home __PUNCT__
not when there ar famili who can't afford to see a doctor __PUNCT__ or send their child to colleg __PUNCT__ or pai their bill at the end of the month __PUNCT__
not when there is a gener that is count on us to give them the same opportun and the same chanc that we had for ourselv __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
american have done thi befor __PUNCT__
some of us had grandpar or parent who said mayb i can't go to colleg but my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but my child can __PUNCT__
i mai have to rent __PUNCT__ but mayb my children will have a home thei can call their own __PUNCT__
i mai not have a lot of monei but mayb my child will run for senat __PUNCT__
i might live in a small villag but mayb somedai my son can be presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__

togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
and i need you to make it happen __PUNCT__
if you want the next four year look like the last eight __PUNCT__ then i am not your candid __PUNCT__
