thi is not a time for ideolog __PUNCT__ it a time for common sens and a polit of pragmat __PUNCT__
the test of an idea must not be whether it is liber or conserv __PUNCT__ the test should be whether it work for the american peopl __PUNCT__
that what we should all be focus on in the dai and week ahead __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
i know folk ar worri __PUNCT__
but i believ that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi becaus i believ in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus thi is the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with courag __PUNCT__
we have seen our share of hard time __PUNCT__
the american stori ha never been about thing come easi __PUNCT__ it been about rise to the moment when the moment is hard __PUNCT__ about reject panick divis for purpos uniti __PUNCT__ about see a mountaintop from the deepest vallei __PUNCT__
that why we rememb that some of the most famou word ever spoken by an american came from a presid who took offic in a time of turmoil __PUNCT__ the onli thing we have to fear is fear itself __PUNCT__
now is not the time for fear __PUNCT__
now is not the time for panic __PUNCT__
now is the time for resolv and steadi leadership __PUNCT__
we can meet thi moment __PUNCT__
we can come togeth to restor confid in the american economi __PUNCT__
we can renew that fundament belief __PUNCT__ that in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
america still ha the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth __PUNCT__
you know thi __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
we home to the worker who have built the largest middl class in histori __PUNCT__
we home to worker who work two job or three job and take the last bu home at night becaus thei want someth more for their children __PUNCT__
we home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and our research facil __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
but i also know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
even as we face the most seriou econom crisi of our time __PUNCT__ even as you ar worri about keep your job or pai your bill or stai in your home __PUNCT__ my oppon campaign announc last week that thei plan to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the discuss about our economi so thei can spend the final week of thi elect attack me instead __PUNCT__
senat mccain campaign actual said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
so in the last coupl of dai __PUNCT__ we seen a barrag of nasti insinu and attack __PUNCT__ and i sure we see much more over the next __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
we know what come __PUNCT__
we know what thei go to do __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
thei can try to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the economi and deni the record of the last eight year __PUNCT__
thei can run mislead ad and pursu the polit of anyth goe __PUNCT__
but it not go to work __PUNCT__
not thi time __PUNCT__
i think that folk ar look for someth differ __PUNCT__
it easi to rile up a crowd by stoke anger and divis __PUNCT__
but that not what we need right now in the unit state __PUNCT__
the time ar too seriou __PUNCT__
the challeng ar too great __PUNCT__
the american peopl aren't look for someon who can divid thi countri __PUNCT__ thei look for someon who will lead it __PUNCT__
we in a seriou crisi __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ more than ever __PUNCT__ it is time to put countri ahead of polit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ more than ever __PUNCT__ it is time to bring chang to washington so that it work for the peopl of thi countri that we love __PUNCT__
i know my oppon is worri about hi campaign __PUNCT__
but that not what i concern about __PUNCT__
i think about the american lose their job __PUNCT__ and their home __PUNCT__ and their life save __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of the econom theori that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of less regul so that no on in washington is watch anyon on wall street __PUNCT__
we seen where that led us and we not go back __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just corpor ceo __PUNCT__ but their secretari too __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
my oppon ha a fundament differ view __PUNCT__
recent __PUNCT__ he propos a plan that would hand over __MONEY__ billion to underwrit the kind of greed and irrespons on wall street that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
it punish taxpay __PUNCT__ reward bank __PUNCT__ and won't solv our hous crisi __PUNCT__
at first __PUNCT__ he said thi spend would come from the rescu packag that alreadi pass __PUNCT__
but the rescu packag includ taxpay protect that prevent exactli thi kind of scheme __PUNCT__
we ar not go to solv the immedi crisi by go back and chang the law we pass last week to push forward a plan that would take month to implement __PUNCT__
so i have a differ view from senat mccain __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we need to help innoc homebuy __PUNCT__
that why i insist that the rescu packag give the treasuri author to bui and rework mortgag __PUNCT__
we have given treasuri a broad menu of option that should be pursu __PUNCT__
but we should not put taxpay monei at unnecessari risk __PUNCT__
taxpay should not have all the downsid without ani of the upsid __PUNCT__
that a principl that i fought for __PUNCT__ that a principl that i maintain __PUNCT__ and that a principl that i stand up for as presid __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i repeat __PUNCT__ we must do more to help innoc homebuy __PUNCT__
i work on a seri of propos over the past two year to do that __PUNCT__
but we need to do it in a respons wai __PUNCT__
that mean make sure that we not overpai for these mortgag and reward the veri lender whose reckless help caus thi crisi __PUNCT__
it mean give taxpay a share of the benefit when our hous market recov __PUNCT__
and it mean crack down on predatori lender by treat mortgag fraud like the crime that it is __PUNCT__
we also have to make sure that if the treasuri move forward with it plan to put more monei into struggl bank __PUNCT__ taxpay will be abl to get their monei back and the ceo who contribut to thi crisi won't get rich at our expens __PUNCT__
now let be clear ohio __PUNCT__ the rescu plan that pass congress last week isn't the end of what we need to do to strengthen thi economi __PUNCT__
it onli the begin __PUNCT__
now we need to pass a rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class that will provid everi famili immedi relief to cope with rise food and ga price __PUNCT__ save on million job by rebuild our school and road __PUNCT__ and help state and citi avoid budget cut and tax increas __PUNCT__
and we should extend expir unemploy benefit to those american who lost their job and can't find new on __PUNCT__
i been fight for thi plan for month __PUNCT__
my oppon ha said noth __PUNCT__
and that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ it ha to start with our small busi on main street __PUNCT__ not just the big bank on wall street __PUNCT__
small busi emploi half of the worker in the privat sector in thi countri __PUNCT__ and account for the major of the job growth __PUNCT__
but we also know that a credit crunch ha dri up capit and put these job at risk __PUNCT__ shop can't financ their inventori __PUNCT__ and small firm can't make payrol __PUNCT__ it harder to get an idea off the ground __PUNCT__ or to provid health care for your employe __PUNCT__
if we don't act __PUNCT__ we be look at scale back oper __PUNCT__ shutter shop __PUNCT__ and laid off worker __PUNCT__
that why we need a small busi rescu plan __PUNCT__ so that we extend our hand to the shop and restaur __PUNCT__ the start __PUNCT__ up and small firm that creat job and make our economi grow __PUNCT__
main street need relief and you need it now __PUNCT__
we won't grow govern __PUNCT__ we work within the small busi administr to keep folk afloat __PUNCT__ while provid tax cut to lift the tide __PUNCT__
it what we did after 9/11 __PUNCT__ and we were abl to get low cost loan out to ten of thousand of small busi __PUNCT__
that on of the mani step we can and should take to help stop job loss and turn thi economi around __PUNCT__
it start with a nation __PUNCT__ wide program to provid afford __PUNCT__ fix __PUNCT__ rate loan to small busi across the countri __PUNCT__
we can run thi through the sba disast loan program __PUNCT__ which provid loan to small busi owner get the help thei need to maintain their inventori and meet their payrol __PUNCT__
we also make it easier for privat lender to make small busi loan by expand the sba loan guarante program __PUNCT__
by temporarili elimin fee for borrow and lender __PUNCT__ we can unlock the credit that small firm need to move forward __PUNCT__ pai their worker __PUNCT__ and grow their busi __PUNCT__
just as we make lend more avail __PUNCT__ we need to reliev the tax burden on small busi to help creat job __PUNCT__
that why i propos elimin all capit gain tax on invest in small busi and start __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ i propos an addit temporari busi tax incent through next year to encourag new invest __PUNCT__
becaus it time to protect the job we have and to creat the job of tomorrow by unlock the drive __PUNCT__ and ingenu __PUNCT__ and innov of the american peopl __PUNCT__
that what i do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
bottom __PUNCT__ up growth also depend on a tax code that doesn't just work for the folk at the top __PUNCT__
you heard a lot about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ here the truth __PUNCT__ my oppon and i ar both offer tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to give __MONEY__ billion in tax cut to the biggest corpor in america __PUNCT__ and he want to give the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo a __MONEY__ tax cut __PUNCT__
but he give noth at all to over __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
i have a differ set of prioriti __PUNCT__
i give a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all worker __PUNCT__
and if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ percent of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
we know that it time to creat the good __PUNCT__ pai job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
ohio is hurt __PUNCT__
__NUM__ job have been lost thi year __PUNCT__
you got __NUM__ percent unemploy __PUNCT__
wage ar flat __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__
but it doesn't have to be thi wai __PUNCT__
that why i go to stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and start rebuild the middl class by help compani creat job here in ohio __PUNCT__
i will be a presid who put you first __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
becaus i believ in the american peopl and what we can do togeth __PUNCT__
and if we want to turn thi economi around and lead the world in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we have to creat the high __PUNCT__ wage job of tomorrow right here in america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
we will work with the build trade to expand apprenticeship program so young worker can develop their skill __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix our broken health care system __PUNCT__

my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
and if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__

you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
