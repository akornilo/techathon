hi first reaction to thi crisi on mondai wa to stand up and repeat the line he said over and over and over again throughout thi campaign __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ the fundament of our economi ar strong __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ hi campaign must realiz that probabl wasn't a smart thing to sai on the dai of a financi meltdown __PUNCT__ so thei sent him back out a few hour later to clean up hi remark __PUNCT__

so while he isn't offer real solut __PUNCT__ he can't talk enough about how greedi wall street is __PUNCT__ and how he go to take on that ol __PUNCT__ boi network in washington __PUNCT__
at thi rate __PUNCT__ by the end of the week john mccain will be tell us how he and phil gramm and the seven lobbyist ar plan to storm the treasuri depart with torch and pitchfork __PUNCT__
come on __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i certainli don't fault senat mccain for all of the problem we face right now __PUNCT__ but i do fault the econom philosophi he follow for twenti __PUNCT__ six year __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai even common __PUNCT__ sens regul ar unnecessari and unwis __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that let washington lobbyist shred consum protect and distort our economi so it work for the special interest instead of work peopl __PUNCT__
well let be clear __PUNCT__ what we seen the last few dai is noth less than the final verdict on thi philosophi __PUNCT__ a philosophi that ha complet fail __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state becaus the dream of the american peopl must not be endang ani more __PUNCT__
it time to put an end to a broken system in washington that is break the american economi __PUNCT__
it time for chang that make a real differ in your live __PUNCT__
we have a differ wai of measur the fundament of our economi __PUNCT__
we know that the fundament that we us to measur econom strength ar whether we ar live up to that fundament promis that ha made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that america is a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__ that everyon should have the chanc to live their dream __PUNCT__
i know i wouldn't be stand here todai without that promis __PUNCT__

unlik senat mccain __PUNCT__ it didn't take a crisi on wall street for me to understand that folk ar hurt out on main street __PUNCT__
it wa two year ago that i introduc legisl to stop mortgag transact that promot fraud __PUNCT__ risk or abus __PUNCT__
it wa on year ago that i call on our treasuri secretari and our fed chairman to bring everi stakehold togeth and find a solut to the subprim mortgag meltdown befor it got wors __PUNCT__
