we meet todai at a moment of great uncertainti for america __PUNCT__
in recent week __PUNCT__ we seen a grow financi crisi that threaten not onli bank and busi __PUNCT__ but your econom secur __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
it get harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup __PUNCT__ busi or that colleg you dream of attend __PUNCT__
and if you invest your life save in the stock market __PUNCT__ you probabl watch a good chunk of it disappear __PUNCT__
it a crisi that been year in the make __PUNCT__ the result of greed and irrespons that stretch from wall street to washington __PUNCT__
and the truth is __PUNCT__ it will take more than a few dai to repair the damag __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ the fed took anoth unpreced step to cut rate togeth with nation around the world __PUNCT__ and those nation will soon be gather in washington to deal with thi crisi __PUNCT__
the next presid will have to manag thi recoveri __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ will that presid be look out for you __PUNCT__
senat mccain and i had a chanc to talk about thi the other night in nashvil __PUNCT__
some of you mai have seen it __PUNCT__
in that debat __PUNCT__ he offer what he said wa a new idea to help deal with the financi crisi __PUNCT__ and that wa to have the govern __PUNCT__ mean taxpay __PUNCT__ bui up bad mortgag in america __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the idea wasn't particularli new __PUNCT__
the author for the secretari of treasuri to bui and renegoti bad mortgag is part of the financi rescu plan we just pass __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i propos it myself becaus __PUNCT__ if it properli done and limit in scope __PUNCT__ such buyback can be on tool to help innoc homeown stai in their home on term thei can afford __PUNCT__
but i also said at the time that thi should not be a vehicl to reward bank and lend institut that recklessli wrote bad loan __PUNCT__
it should not be a bailout for the high __PUNCT__ roll real estat specul who took those loan to make a quick buck __PUNCT__
we have to act to fix our broken economi and restor the credit market __PUNCT__
but taxpay shouldn't be ask to pick up the tab for the veri folk who help creat thi crisi __PUNCT__
and that the problem with senat mccain riski idea __PUNCT__
on tuesdai night __PUNCT__ hi campaign said that he would ask the bank to absorb some of the cost by sell the bad mortgag to the govern at a discount __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ by wednesdai morn __PUNCT__ he chang hi mind and wa propos to bail out bank and lender with taxpay monei __PUNCT__
senat mccain actual want the govern to pai the full face valu of mortgag on the book __PUNCT__ even though thei not worth that much anymor __PUNCT__
it a plan that would guarante that american taxpay lose by hand over __MONEY__ billion to underwrit the kind of greed and irrespons on wall street that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
but it not just that the mccain bailout reward irrespons lender __PUNCT__ it that hi bailout would make it more like that those lender keep up their bad behavior __PUNCT__
just yesterdai __PUNCT__ countrywid __PUNCT__ on of the nation largest lender __PUNCT__ reach an agreement to help homeown refin their mortgag __PUNCT__
under senat mccain plan __PUNCT__ lender like countrywid wouldn't have ani incent to come forward and help homeown __PUNCT__ becaus thei could just wait for the govern to bail them out __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is just the latest in a seri of shift posit that senat mccain ha taken on thi issu __PUNCT__
hi first respons to thi crisi in march wa that homeown shouldn't get ani help at all __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ a few week ago __PUNCT__ he put out a plan that basic ignor homeown __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ in the cours of __NUM__ hour __PUNCT__ he end up with a plan that punish taxpay __PUNCT__ reward bank __PUNCT__ and won't solv our hous crisi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think we can afford that kind of errat and uncertain leadership in these uncertain time __PUNCT__
we need steadi leadership in the white hous __PUNCT__
we need a presid we can trust in time of crisi __PUNCT__
and that the kind of presid i intend to be __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ we must do more to help innoc homebuy __PUNCT__
i work on a seri of propos over the past two year to do that __PUNCT__
and i support the treasuri effort to bui up troubl mortgag __PUNCT__
but we need to do it in a respons wai __PUNCT__
that mean make sure that we not overpai for these mortgag and reward the veri lender whose reckless help caus thi crisi __PUNCT__
it mean give taxpay a share of the benefit when our hous market recov __PUNCT__
and it mean do what i propos more than two year ago and crack down on predatori lender by treat mortgag fraud like the crime that it is __PUNCT__
we also have to make sure that if the treasuri move forward with it plan to put more monei into struggl bank __PUNCT__ taxpay will be abl to get their monei back and the ceo who contribut to thi crisi won't get rich as a result __PUNCT__
and those aig execut who went on vacat with taxpay dollar __PUNCT__ thei should return to washington with a check for the taxpay and be fire on the spot __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar other step we can take to help homeown that won't cost taxpay a dime __PUNCT__
on thing we can do is chang our bankruptci law so thei help ordinari folk __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the law let bankruptci judg write down your mortgag if you own six or seven home __PUNCT__ but not if you have onli on __PUNCT__
that might help senat mccain sleep easier at night __PUNCT__ but it won't do anyth for peopl like you __PUNCT__
that why if i presid __PUNCT__ and you like most peopl and own onli on home __PUNCT__ i make sure those judg can write down your mortgag too __PUNCT__
so i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__ for ohio and for america __PUNCT__
but i believ we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__ not just becaus i have confid in the plan i propos or the leadership i offer __PUNCT__ but becaus i believ in you __PUNCT__
becaus i believ in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus thi is the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with courag __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
america still ha the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth who work two job or three job and take the last bu home at night becaus thei want someth more for their children __PUNCT__
we still the home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and our research facil __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
of cours we can __PUNCT__
but i also know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why the decis you make in twenti __PUNCT__ six dai is so import __PUNCT__
that why thi is no ordinari elect __PUNCT__ becaus thi is no ordinari moment for america __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ even as we face the most seriou econom crisi of our time __PUNCT__ even as so mani american ar worri about keep their job or pai their bill or stai in their home __PUNCT__ senat mccain campaign announc last week that thei plan to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the discuss about our economi and spend the final week of thi elect attack me instead __PUNCT__
hi campaign actual said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
well i got new for john mccain __PUNCT__
thi isn't about lose a campaign __PUNCT__ thi is about american who ar lose their job __PUNCT__ and their home __PUNCT__ and their life save __PUNCT__
i can take four more week of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but america can't take four more year of john mccain georg bush polici __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of the econom theori that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
we can't afford more four year of john mccain call for less regul so that no on in washington is watch anyon on wall street __PUNCT__
we seen where that led us and we not go back __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just corpor ceo __PUNCT__ but their secretari too __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass congress last week isn't the end of what we do to strengthen thi economi __PUNCT__ it onli the begin __PUNCT__
now we need to pass a rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class that will provid everi famili immedi relief to cope with rise food and ga price __PUNCT__ save on million job by rebuild our school and road __PUNCT__ and help state and citi avoid budget cut and tax increas __PUNCT__
and we should extend expir unemploy benefit to those american who lost their job and can't find new on __PUNCT__
i been fight for thi plan for month __PUNCT__
my oppon ha said noth __PUNCT__
and that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
