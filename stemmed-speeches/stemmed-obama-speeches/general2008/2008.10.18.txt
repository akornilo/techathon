we meet at a moment of great uncertainti for america __PUNCT__
the econom crisi we face is the worst sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
as the stock market ha plummet __PUNCT__ million of american have open up their __NUM__ __PUNCT__ k __PUNCT__ statement to see that so much of their hard __PUNCT__ earn save have disappear __PUNCT__
the credit crisi ha left busi larg and small unabl to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip __PUNCT__ or hire new worker __PUNCT__ or even make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
in household across the countri __PUNCT__ it get harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup __PUNCT__ busi or that colleg you dream of attend __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in nearli a decad __PUNCT__
you pai more for everyth from ga to groceri __PUNCT__ but your paycheck have flat __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
i know folk ar worri __PUNCT__
but i believ that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi becaus i believ in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus thi is the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
the american stori ha never been about thing come easi __PUNCT__ it been about rise to the moment when the moment is hard __PUNCT__
america can meet thi moment __PUNCT__
we have the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth __PUNCT__
we home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and research facil __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
but missouri __PUNCT__ i also know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
even as we face the most seriou econom crisi of our time __PUNCT__ even as you ar worri about keep your job or pai your bill or stai in your home __PUNCT__ my oppon campaign announc earlier thi month that thei want to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the discuss about our economi so thei can spend the final week of thi elect attack me instead __PUNCT__
senat mccain campaign actual said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ missouri __PUNCT__ here what my oppon doesn't seem to understand __PUNCT__
with the economi in turmoil and the american dream at risk __PUNCT__ the american peopl don't want to hear politician attack each other __PUNCT__ you want to hear about how we go to attack the challeng face middl class famili each and everi dai __PUNCT__
you want to hear about the issu that matter in your live __PUNCT__
you want to hear about how we go to bring about the chang that we desper need for our countri __PUNCT__
that what the american peopl want to hear __PUNCT__
so let talk about the issu that matter __PUNCT__
in the debat thi week __PUNCT__ my oppon felt the need to inform me that he not presid bush __PUNCT__
and in fair __PUNCT__ i don't blame senat mccain for all of presid bush mistak __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ he onli vote with georg bush __NUM__ percent of the time __PUNCT__
but it is fair to sai that over the cours of three debat and twenti month __PUNCT__ senat mccain still hasn't offer a singl thing that he would do differ from georg w __PUNCT__ bush when it come to the most import econom issu we face todai __PUNCT__
not on __PUNCT__
just look at tax __PUNCT__
my oppon been talk a lot about tax in hi campaign __PUNCT__
but here the truth missouri __PUNCT__ we ar both offer tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is who we cut tax for __PUNCT__
it come down to valu __PUNCT__ in america __PUNCT__ do we simpli valu wealth __PUNCT__ or do we valu the work that creat it __PUNCT__ for eight year __PUNCT__ we seen what happen when we put the extrem wealthi and well __PUNCT__ connect ahead of work peopl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ john mccain think that the wai to rebuild thi economi is to doubl down on georg bush polici of give more and more tax break to those at the veri top in the fals hope that it will all trickl down __PUNCT__
i think it time to rebuild the middl class in thi countri __PUNCT__ and that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
senat mccain want to give the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo a __MONEY__ tax cut but absolut noth at all to over __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
i want to cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ percent of all worker __PUNCT__
and under my plan __PUNCT__ if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ percent of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
it time to give the middl class a break __PUNCT__ and that what i do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
late __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha been attack my middl class tax cut __PUNCT__
he actual said it goe to __PUNCT__ those who don't pai tax __PUNCT__ even though it onli goe to work peopl who ar alreadi get tax on their paycheck __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ missouri __PUNCT__ john mccain is so out of touch with the struggl you ar face that he must be the first politician in histori to call a tax cut for work peopl __PUNCT__ welfar __PUNCT__
the onli __PUNCT__ welfar __PUNCT__ in thi campaign is john mccain plan to give anoth __MONEY__ billion in tax cut to the wealthiest corpor in america __PUNCT__ includ __MONEY__ billion in tax break to big oil compani that ran up record profit under georg bush __PUNCT__
that who john mccain is fight for __PUNCT__
but we can't afford four more year like the last eight __PUNCT__
georg bush and john mccain ar out of idea __PUNCT__ thei ar out of touch __PUNCT__ and if you stand with me in __NUM__ dai thei will be out of time __PUNCT__
we need new prioriti in washington __PUNCT__
i think it time to give a tax cut to the teacher and janitor who work in our school __PUNCT__ to the cop and firefight who keep us safe __PUNCT__ to the waitress work doubl shift __PUNCT__ the nurs in the er __PUNCT__ and the plumber fight for their american dream __PUNCT__
these worker ar the backbon of our countri __PUNCT__
thei ar the on that washington ha forgotten __PUNCT__
thei the on i fight for __PUNCT__
and while senat mccain ignor the payrol tax you pai to score a few polit point __PUNCT__ i put a tax cut into the pocket of work peopl so you can pai the bill __PUNCT__ put awai some save __PUNCT__ and pass on a brighter futur to your children __PUNCT__
so senat mccain can keep try to attack me and distract you __PUNCT__ but it not go to work __PUNCT__
not thi time __PUNCT__ not now __PUNCT__
becaus while my oppon think thi campaign is all about me __PUNCT__ the truth is __PUNCT__ thi campaign is about you __PUNCT__
your job __PUNCT__
your health care __PUNCT__
your retir __PUNCT__
your children futur __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__
becaus i can take __NUM__ more week of these attack from john mccain __PUNCT__ but the american peopl can't take four more year of the same fail polici and the same divis polit __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass the congress wa a necessari first step to eas thi credit crisi __PUNCT__ but now we need a rescu plan for the middl class __PUNCT__
if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ it ha to start on main street __PUNCT__ not just the big bank on wall street __PUNCT__
that why i outlin sever step that we have to take right now to help folk who ar struggl __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we got to act now to creat good pai job __PUNCT__
we alreadi lost three __PUNCT__ quarter of a million job thi year __PUNCT__
that why i propos a new american job tax credit for each new employe that compani hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
and that why i stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea and invest in compani that creat good job right here in missouri __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we need to help small busi get back on their feet __PUNCT__
to fuel the real engin of job creation in thi countri __PUNCT__ i elimin all capit gain tax on invest in small busi and start __PUNCT__ up compani __PUNCT__ and provid an addit tax incent through next year to encourag new small busi invest __PUNCT__
and we also make sure that small busi can access the immedi loan thei need to pai their worker and financ their inventori __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we need to provid relief for homeown __PUNCT__
the treasuri must us the author it been grant and move aggress to help peopl avoid foreclosur and stai in their home __PUNCT__
we don't need a new law or a new __MONEY__ billion giveawai to bank like senat mccain ha propos __PUNCT__
we just need to act quickli and decis __PUNCT__
for those respons homeown in danger of lose their home __PUNCT__ i propos a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur so that we give peopl the breath room thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we got to help state and local govern that have been squeez __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ twenti __PUNCT__ on state ar face budget short __PUNCT__ fall __PUNCT__ and thei might be forc to cut servic or rais tax __PUNCT__
that why i go to creat a __MONEY__ billion fund to help state and local govern pai for health care and educ __PUNCT__ polic and firefight __PUNCT__ without have to rais your tax __PUNCT__
and we save on million job by creat a job and growth fund that will help state move forward with project to rebuild and repair our road __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ and our school __PUNCT__
these ar the step that we must take __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to start get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
but we also need a new set of prioriti to grow our economi and creat job over the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix our broken health care system __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha been eager to share some detail of hi health care plan __PUNCT__ but not all __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we found out that he want to pai for hi plan by tax your health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ just like georg bush __PUNCT__
that wa bad enough __PUNCT__
but it turn out __PUNCT__ senat mccain would pai for part of hi plan by make drastic cut in medicar __MONEY__ billion worth __PUNCT__
under hi plan __PUNCT__ if you count on medicar __PUNCT__ you would have fewer place to get care __PUNCT__ and less freedom to choos your doctor __PUNCT__
you pai more for your drug __PUNCT__ receiv fewer servic __PUNCT__ and get lower qualiti care __PUNCT__
i think everi singl american ha a right to afford access health care __PUNCT__
we can strengthen medicar by elimin wast subsidi to big hmo in medicar __PUNCT__ and make sure senior can access home __PUNCT__ base care __PUNCT__ and let medicar negoti with drug compani for better price __PUNCT__
that the kind of chang we need __PUNCT__
and if i presid __PUNCT__ we give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the skill and the knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and it mean make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
my oppon top econom advisor actual said that thei have no plan to invest in colleg afford becaus we can't have a giveawai to everi special interest __PUNCT__
well i don't think the young peopl of america ar a special interest __PUNCT__ thei ar the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i make thi deal with you __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
no if __PUNCT__ and or but __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i will take on the corrupt in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisi like thi can never __PUNCT__ ever happen again __PUNCT__
i put in place the common __PUNCT__ sens regul and rule of the road i been call for sinc march __PUNCT__ rule that will keep our market free __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and honest __PUNCT__ rule that will restor account and respons in our corpor boardroom __PUNCT__
and just as we demand account on wall street __PUNCT__ i will also demand it in washington __PUNCT__
that why i not go to stand here and simpli tell you what i go to spend __PUNCT__ i go to tell you how we go to save when i am presid __PUNCT__
i do what you do in your own famili budget and make sure we spend monei wise __PUNCT__
i will go through the entir feder budget __PUNCT__ page by page __PUNCT__ line by line __PUNCT__ and elimin program that don't work and aren't need __PUNCT__
we start by end a war in iraq that cost us nearli a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
and we save billion more by cut wast __PUNCT__ improv manag __PUNCT__ and strengthen oversight __PUNCT__
these ar the chang and reform we need __PUNCT__
a new era of respons and account on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
common __PUNCT__ sens regul to prevent a crisi like thi from ever happen again __PUNCT__
invest in the technolog and innov that will restor prosper and lead to new job and a new economi for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
bottom __PUNCT__ up growth that give everi american a fair shot at the american dream __PUNCT__
and abov all confid __PUNCT__ confid in america __PUNCT__ confid in our economi __PUNCT__ and confid in ourselv __PUNCT__
i won't pretend thi will be easi or come without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow our own petti differ and broken polit to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ to believ in yourselv __PUNCT__ in each other __PUNCT__ and in the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__

not when there ar so mani american without job and without home __PUNCT__
not when there ar famili who can't afford to see a doctor __PUNCT__ or send their child to colleg __PUNCT__ or pai their bill at the end of the month __PUNCT__
not when there is a gener that is count on us to give them the same opportun and the same chanc that we had for ourselv __PUNCT__
we ar __NUM__ dai awai from chang thi countri __PUNCT__
