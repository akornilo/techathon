the econom crisi we face is the worst sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
busi larg and small ar find it imposs to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip __PUNCT__ or hire new worker __PUNCT__ or even make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
__NUM__ worker lost their job in florida thi year __PUNCT__ more than ani other state in thi countri __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in a decad __PUNCT__ at a time when the cost of health care and colleg have never been higher __PUNCT__
it get harder and harder to make the mortgag __PUNCT__ or fill up your ga tank __PUNCT__ or even keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__

becaus i believ in you __PUNCT__
i believ in the american peopl __PUNCT__
we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with confid __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
but florida __PUNCT__ i know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon ha made hi choic __PUNCT__
senat mccain campaign actual said a coupl of week ago that thei were go to launch a seri of attack on my charact becaus __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
and that a promis john mccain ha kept __PUNCT__
he been on the attack __PUNCT__
that what you do when you ar out of idea __PUNCT__ out of touch __PUNCT__ and run out of time __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i can take a few more week of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but the american peopl can't take four more year of the same fail polici and the same fail polit __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we have tri it john mccain wai __PUNCT__
we have tri it georg bush wai __PUNCT__
it hasn't work __PUNCT__
it time for someth new __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass congress wa a necessari first step to eas thi credit crisi __PUNCT__ but if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ we need an immedi rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and that what i offer as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ i laid out a plan that will jumpstart job creation __PUNCT__ provid relief to famili __PUNCT__ and rebuild our financi system __PUNCT__
it a plan that will also help struggl homeown stai in their home __PUNCT__ someth that particularli import here in florida __PUNCT__ where foreclosur ar up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ over the last year __PUNCT__
all across thi state __PUNCT__ there ar famili who done everyth right __PUNCT__ but who ar now face foreclosur or see their home valu declin becaus of bad decis on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
the other week __PUNCT__ senat mccain came out with a propos that he said would help eas the burden on homeown by bui up bad mortgag at face valu __PUNCT__ even though thei not worth that much anymor __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__
hi plan would amount to a __MONEY__ billion bailout for wall street bank __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ it would all be paid for by you __PUNCT__ the american taxpay __PUNCT__
that might sound like a good idea to the former bank lobbyist run my oppon campaign __PUNCT__
but that not the chang america need __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ we must act quickli to end thi hous crisi __PUNCT__
that why last march __PUNCT__ i wa call for us to help innoc home buyer __PUNCT__
and that why i fought to make sure the recent rescu packag give treasuri the respons and author to help homeown avoid foreclosur __PUNCT__
but we should not put your tax dollar at unnecessari risk __PUNCT__
we should not let bank and lender off the hook when it wa their greed and irrespons that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
we should not be bail out wall street __PUNCT__ we should be restor opportun on main street __PUNCT__
and that what i do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
if the american peopl ar go to put up __MONEY__ billion to rescu our financi institut __PUNCT__ we should make sure those institut ar do their part for the american peopl __PUNCT__
that why i call for a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur __PUNCT__
if you ar a bank or lender that is get monei from the rescu plan __PUNCT__ and your custom ar make a good __PUNCT__ faith effort to make their mortgag payment and re __PUNCT__ negoti their mortgag __PUNCT__ you will not be abl to foreclos on their home for three month __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we also put in place long __PUNCT__ term measur to restor our credit market and help famili refin their mortgag __PUNCT__ but until those measur start work __PUNCT__ we need to help homeown stai in their home __PUNCT__ and that what thi foreclosur freez will do __PUNCT__
and while we at it __PUNCT__ there anoth step we can take to help innoc homeown that won't cost taxpay a dime __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ if you own onli on home __PUNCT__ you not allow to write down your mortgag in bankruptci court __PUNCT__
but if you own more than on home __PUNCT__ if you own __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ six or seven home like my oppon __PUNCT__ you ar allow to write down your mortgag __PUNCT__
that might help senat mccain sleep easier at night __PUNCT__
but it isn't right __PUNCT__ and it will chang when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
but understand __PUNCT__ if we seriou about restor opportun for our middl class __PUNCT__ it not enough to help peopl refin their mortgag __PUNCT__
it not enough to protect your home from foreclosur __PUNCT__
we have to help the hardwork famili who ar live in those home with shrink paycheck and rise cost __PUNCT__
that start with tax relief __PUNCT__
there been a lot of talk about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
and the truth is __PUNCT__ my oppon and i ar both propos tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to give a __MONEY__ tax cut to fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__
i want to put a __MONEY__ tax cut in the pocket of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of american worker __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
it true that i want to roll back the bush tax cut on the wealthiest american and go back to the rate thei paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
john mccain call that social __PUNCT__
what he forget is that just a few year ago __PUNCT__ he himself said those bush tax cut were irrespons __PUNCT__
he said he couldn't __PUNCT__ in good conscienc __PUNCT__ support a tax cut where the benefit went to the wealthi at the expens of __PUNCT__ middl class american who most need tax relief __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he wa right then __PUNCT__ and i am right now __PUNCT__
and let me be crystal clear __PUNCT__ if you make less than a quarter of a million dollar a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
that is my commit to you __PUNCT__
to creat more american job __PUNCT__ i propos a tax credit for each new employe that compani hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
and i stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea and invest in compani that creat good job right here in florida __PUNCT__
i help small busi get back on their feet by elimin capit gain tax and give them emerg loan to keep their door open and hire worker __PUNCT__
and i will creat a job and growth fund to help state and local govern save on million job and pai for health care and educ without have to rais your tax __PUNCT__
these ar the step that we must take __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to start get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
but we also need a new set of prioriti to grow our economi and creat job over the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix the problem in our health care system that we been talk about for too long __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
and if i presid __PUNCT__ we give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the skill and the knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and it mean make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
my oppon top econom advisor actual said that thei have no plan to invest in colleg afford becaus we can't have a giveawai to everi special interest __PUNCT__
well i don't think the young peopl of america ar a special interest __PUNCT__ thei ar the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i make thi deal with you __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
no if __PUNCT__ and or but __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
florida __PUNCT__ it time for a chang __PUNCT__
i know it __PUNCT__ you know it __PUNCT__ and the american peopl know it __PUNCT__
the other week __PUNCT__ i wa in ohio __PUNCT__ and i went to thi small town call georgetown __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i wa hungri and i need a snack __PUNCT__
so i ask where i could find the best pie in town __PUNCT__
and folk point to thi diner __PUNCT__
so i went there __PUNCT__ and as i wait for a pie __PUNCT__ some of the employe said __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ can you pleas take a pictur with us becaus the owner is a die __PUNCT__ hard republican and we want to poke him a littl __PUNCT__
and just then __PUNCT__ the owner come out __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ i understand you a die __PUNCT__ hard republican __PUNCT__
he said ye __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how busi __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ not so good becaus my custom can't afford to eat out right now __PUNCT__
so i said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ who do you think ha been run the economi for the last eight year __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ the republican __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ if you keep hit your head against a wall and it start to hurt __PUNCT__ at some point don't you stop hit it against the wall __PUNCT__
mayb you should try the democrat for a chang __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ make no mistak __PUNCT__ the chang we need won't come easi or without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to tighten our belt __PUNCT__ we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
at a defin moment like thi __PUNCT__ we don't have the luxuri of reli on the same polit game and the same polit tactic that ar us everi elect to divid us from on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
with the challeng and crise we face right now __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to divid thi countri by class or region __PUNCT__ by who we ar or what polici we support __PUNCT__
there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
we ar not separ by the pro __PUNCT__ america and anti __PUNCT__ america part of thi nation __PUNCT__ we all love thi countri __PUNCT__ no matter where we live or where we come from __PUNCT__
there ar patriot who support thi war in iraq and patriot who oppos it __PUNCT__ patriot who believ in democrat polici and those who believ in republican polici __PUNCT__
the men and women from florida and all across america who serv on our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we have alwai been at our best when we had leadership that call us to look past our differ and come togeth as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__ leadership that ralli thi entir countri to a common purpos __PUNCT__ to a higher purpos __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state of america becaus that is the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow the same divis and fear tactic and our own petti differ to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ to believ in yourselv __PUNCT__ in each other __PUNCT__ and in the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when we have a crisi to solv and an economi to save __PUNCT__
not when there ar so mani american without job and without home __PUNCT__
not when there ar famili who can't afford to see a doctor __PUNCT__ or send their child to colleg __PUNCT__ or pai their bill at the end of the month __PUNCT__
not when there is a gener that is count on us to give them the same opportun and the same chanc that we had for ourselv __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
american have done thi befor __PUNCT__
some of us had grandpar or parent who said mayb i can't go to colleg but my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but my child can __PUNCT__
i mai have to rent __PUNCT__ but mayb my children will have a home thei can call their own __PUNCT__
i mai not have a lot of monei but mayb my child will run for senat __PUNCT__

and i need you to make it happen __PUNCT__
if you want the next four year look like the last eight __PUNCT__ then i am not your candid __PUNCT__
