we meet at a moment of great uncertainti for america __PUNCT__
the econom crisi we face is the worst sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
as the stock market ha plummet __PUNCT__ million of american have open up their __NUM__ __PUNCT__ k __PUNCT__ statement to see that so much of their hard __PUNCT__ earn save have disappear __PUNCT__
the credit crisi ha left busi larg and small unabl to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip __PUNCT__ or hire new worker __PUNCT__ or even make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
in household across the countri __PUNCT__ it get harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup __PUNCT__ busi or that colleg you dream of attend __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in nearli a decad __PUNCT__
you pai more for everyth from ga to groceri __PUNCT__ but your paycheck have flat __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
i know folk ar worri __PUNCT__
but i believ that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi becaus i believ in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus thi is the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
the american stori ha never been about thing come easi __PUNCT__ it been about rise to the moment when the moment is hard __PUNCT__
america can meet thi moment __PUNCT__
we have the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth __PUNCT__
we home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and research facil __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
but virginia __PUNCT__ i also know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
even as we face the most seriou econom crisi of our time __PUNCT__ even as you ar worri about keep your job or pai your bill or stai in your home __PUNCT__ my oppon campaign announc earlier thi month that thei want to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the discuss about our economi so thei can spend the final week of thi elect attack me instead __PUNCT__
senat mccain campaign actual said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ here what senat mccain doesn't seem to understand __PUNCT__
with the economi in turmoil and the american dream at risk __PUNCT__ the american peopl don't want to hear politician attack each other __PUNCT__ you want to hear about how we go to attack the challeng face middl class famili each and everi dai __PUNCT__
you want to hear about the issu that matter in your live __PUNCT__
you want to hear about how we go to bring about the chang that we desper need for our countri __PUNCT__
that what the american peopl want to hear __PUNCT__
so let talk about the issu that matter __PUNCT__
in the debat thi week __PUNCT__ senat mccain felt the need to inform me that he not presid bush __PUNCT__
and in fair __PUNCT__ i don't blame senat mccain for all of presid bush mistak __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ he onli vote with georg bush __NUM__ percent of the time __PUNCT__
but it is fair to sai that over the cours of three debat and twenti month __PUNCT__ senat mccain still hasn't offer a singl thing that he would do differ from georg w __PUNCT__ bush when it come to the most import econom issu we face todai __PUNCT__
not on __PUNCT__
he want to keep give tax cut to corpor that ship your job oversea just like georg bush __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that creat job right here in america __PUNCT__
he want to give tax cut to exxon __PUNCT__ mobil and big corpor and their ceo __PUNCT__ cut we just can't afford __PUNCT__ just like georg bush __PUNCT__
i want to give a break to __NUM__ percent of middl class american __PUNCT__ folk who need it and deserv it __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to the small busi that creat more than two __PUNCT__ third of our job __PUNCT__
that how we strengthen our countri __PUNCT__
that how we grow our economi again __PUNCT__
i know i not run against presid bush __PUNCT__
but i am run against hi polici __PUNCT__ the polici john mccain ha support __PUNCT__
the polici john mccain would continu __PUNCT__
becaus that someth we can't afford __PUNCT__
and that is especi true when it come to health care __PUNCT__
senat mccain and i have real differ on thi issu __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha been eager to share some detail of hi health care plan __PUNCT__ but not all __PUNCT__
like those ad for prescript drug __PUNCT__ you have to read the fine print to learn the full stori __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we found out that he want to pai for hi plan by tax your health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ just like georg bush __PUNCT__
that wa bad enough __PUNCT__
but the wall street journal recent report that it actual wors than we thought __PUNCT__
it turn out __PUNCT__ senat mccain would pai for part of hi plan by make drastic cut in medicar __MONEY__ billion worth __PUNCT__
__MONEY__ billion in medicar cut to pai for an ill __PUNCT__ conceiv health care plan __PUNCT__ even as medicar alreadi face a loom shortfal __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi should come as no surpris __PUNCT__ it entir consist with senat mccain record dure hi __NUM__ year in congress where __PUNCT__ time and again __PUNCT__ he oppos medicar __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha vote against protect medicar __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
__NUM__ time __PUNCT__ he fail to stand up for medicar __PUNCT__
so what would senat mccain cut mean for medicar at a time when more and more american ar reli on it __PUNCT__
it would mean a cut of more than __NUM__ percent in medicar benefit next year __PUNCT__
if you count on medicar __PUNCT__ it would mean fewer place to get care __PUNCT__ and less freedom to choos your own doctor __PUNCT__
you pai more for your drug __PUNCT__ receiv fewer servic __PUNCT__ and get lower qualiti care __PUNCT__
i don't think that right __PUNCT__
when you work hard your whole life __PUNCT__ and paid into the system __PUNCT__ and done everyth right __PUNCT__ you shouldn't have the carpet pull out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it __PUNCT__
health care shouldn't be some kind of either __PUNCT__ or tradeoff where our senior get left out in the cold __PUNCT__
i think everi singl american ha a right to afford access health care __PUNCT__
we can strengthen medicar by elimin wast subsidi to big hmo in medicar __PUNCT__ and make sure senior can access home __PUNCT__ base care __PUNCT__ and let medicar negoti with drug compani for better price __PUNCT__
that the kind of chang we need __PUNCT__
so in the end __PUNCT__ senat mccain can keep try to attack me and distract you __PUNCT__ but it not go to work __PUNCT__
not thi time __PUNCT__ not now __PUNCT__
becaus while john mccain think thi campaign is all about me __PUNCT__ the truth is __PUNCT__ thi campaign is about you __PUNCT__
your job __PUNCT__
your health care __PUNCT__
your retir __PUNCT__
your children futur __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__
becaus i can take __NUM__ more week of these attack from john mccain __PUNCT__ but the american peopl can't take four more year of the same fail polici and the same divis polit __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass the congress wa a necessari first step to eas thi credit crisi __PUNCT__
it also import that we continu to work with govern around the globe to confront what is truli a global crisi __PUNCT__
but now we need a rescu plan for the middl class __PUNCT__
if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ it ha to start on main street __PUNCT__ not just the big bank on wall street __PUNCT__
that why i outlin sever step that we have to take right now to help folk who ar struggl __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we got to act now to creat good pai job __PUNCT__
we alreadi lost three __PUNCT__ quarter of a million job thi year __PUNCT__ and some expert sai unemploy mai rise to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by the end of next year __PUNCT__
that why i propos a new american job tax credit for each new employe that compani hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
that how we creat good __PUNCT__ new job here in virginia and all across america __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we need to help small busi get back on their feet __PUNCT__
to fuel the real engin of job creation in thi countri __PUNCT__ i elimin all capit gain tax on invest in small busi and start __PUNCT__ up compani __PUNCT__ and provid an addit tax incent through next year to encourag new small busi invest __PUNCT__
and we also make sure that small busi can access the immedi loan thei need to pai their worker and financ their inventori __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we need to provid relief for homeown who ar watch their home valu declin while properti tax go up __PUNCT__
the treasuri must us the author it been grant and move aggress to help peopl avoid foreclosur and stai in their home __PUNCT__
we don't need a new law or a new __MONEY__ billion giveawai to bank like senat mccain ha propos __PUNCT__
we just need to act quickli and decis __PUNCT__
for those respons homeown in danger of lose their home __PUNCT__ i propos a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur so that we give peopl the breath room thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we got to help state and local govern that have been squeez __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ twenti __PUNCT__ on state ar face budget short __PUNCT__ fall __PUNCT__ includ virginia __PUNCT__ and thei might be forc to cut servic or rais tax __PUNCT__ which is the last thing we need when so mani famili ar struggl __PUNCT__
that why i go to creat a __MONEY__ billion fund to help state and local govern pai for health care and educ __PUNCT__ polic and firefight __PUNCT__ without have to rais your tax __PUNCT__
and we save on million job by creat a job and growth fund that will help state and local commun move forward with project to rebuild and repair our road __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ and our school __PUNCT__
these ar the step that we must take __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to start get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
but we also need a new set of prioriti __PUNCT__
bottom __PUNCT__ up growth depend on a tax code that doesn't just work for the folk at the top __PUNCT__
you heard a lot about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ here the truth __PUNCT__ my oppon and i ar both offer tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to doubl down on presid bush tax polici by give __MONEY__ billion in tax cut to the biggest corpor in america __PUNCT__ and give the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo a __MONEY__ tax cut __PUNCT__
but he would give noth at all to over __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
i have a differ set of prioriti __PUNCT__
i give a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all worker __PUNCT__
and if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ percent of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix our broken health care system __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
and we give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the skill and the knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and it mean make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
senat mccain top econom advisor actual said the other dai that thei have no plan to invest in colleg afford becaus we can't have a giveawai to everi special interest __PUNCT__
well i don't think the young peopl of america ar a special interest __PUNCT__ thei ar the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i make thi deal with you __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
no if __PUNCT__ and or but __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i will take on the corrupt in washington and on wall street to make sure a crisi like thi can never __PUNCT__ ever happen again __PUNCT__
i put in place the common __PUNCT__ sens regul and rule of the road i been call for sinc march __PUNCT__ rule that will keep our market free __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and honest __PUNCT__ rule that will restor account and respons in our corpor boardroom __PUNCT__
and just as we demand account on wall street __PUNCT__ i will also demand it in washington __PUNCT__
that why i not go to stand here and simpli tell you what i go to spend __PUNCT__ i go to tell you how we go to save when i am presid __PUNCT__
i do what you do in your own famili budget and make sure we spend monei wise __PUNCT__
i will go through the entir feder budget __PUNCT__ page by page __PUNCT__ line by line __PUNCT__ and elimin program that don't work and aren't need __PUNCT__
we start by end a war in iraq that cost us nearli a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
and we save billion more by cut wast __PUNCT__ improv manag __PUNCT__ and strengthen oversight __PUNCT__
these ar the chang and reform we need __PUNCT__
a new era of respons and account on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
common __PUNCT__ sens regul to prevent a crisi like thi from ever happen again __PUNCT__
invest in the technolog and innov that will restor prosper and lead to new job and a new economi for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
bottom __PUNCT__ up growth that give everi american a fair shot at the american dream __PUNCT__
and abov all confid __PUNCT__ confid in america __PUNCT__ confid in our economi __PUNCT__ and confid in ourselv __PUNCT__
i won't pretend thi will be easi or come without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow our own petti differ and broken polit to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
