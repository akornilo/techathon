befor we begin __PUNCT__ i just want to take a minut to thank senat clinton for the kind and gener support she offer on saturdai __PUNCT__
she ran an histor campaign that shatter barrier on behalf of my daughter and women everywher who now know there ar no limit to their dream __PUNCT__
and more __PUNCT__ she inspir million of women and men with her strength __PUNCT__ her courag __PUNCT__ and her unyield commit to the caus that brought us here todai __PUNCT__ the hope and aspir of work american __PUNCT__
our parti and our countri ar stronger becaus of the work she ha done throughout her life __PUNCT__ and i look forward to work with her in these come month and year to lai out the case for chang and set a new cours for thi countri __PUNCT__
i often said that thi elect repres a defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__
on major issu like the war in iraq or the warm of our planet __PUNCT__ the decis we make in __DATE__ and over the next few year will shape a gener __PUNCT__ if not a centuri __PUNCT__
that is especi true when it come to our economi __PUNCT__
we have now lost job for five straight month __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ sinc the begin of thi year __PUNCT__
last month we saw the biggest rise in the unemploy rate in more than twenti year __PUNCT__
the percentag of home in foreclosur and late mortgag payment is the highest sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
the price of oil ha never been higher and set a record on fridai for the largest on __PUNCT__ dai spike in histori __PUNCT__
the cost of health care and colleg tuition and even food have all hit record level __PUNCT__ while famili incom have fallen and the wage of our worker have stai the same __PUNCT__
you don't have to read the stock ticker or scan the headlin in the financi section to understand the serious of the situat we in right now __PUNCT__
you just have to go to pennsylvania and listen to the man who lost hi job but can't even afford the ga to drive around and look for a new on __PUNCT__
or listen to the woman from iowa who work the night shift after a full dai of class and still can't pai the medic bill for a sister who ill __PUNCT__
or talk to the worker i met in indiana who work at the same plant hi father work at for thirti year until thei move it to mexico and made the worker actual pack up the equip themselv so thei could send it to china __PUNCT__
go to janesvil __PUNCT__ wisconsin or morain __PUNCT__ ohio and talk to the worker at gener motor who just found out the plant thei labor their entir live at will be close forev __PUNCT__ or the thousand of truck driver and airlin worker who will lose their job becaus of the debilit cost of fuel __PUNCT__
or just ask ani famili in north carolina who will sit around their kitchen tabl tonight and wonder whether next week paycheck will be enough to cover next month bill __PUNCT__ who will look at their children without know if thei be abl to give them the same chanc that thei had __PUNCT__
we did not arriv at the doorstep of our current econom crisi by some accid of histori __PUNCT__
thi wa not an inevit part of the busi cycl that wa beyond our power to avoid __PUNCT__
it wa the logic conclus of a tire and misguid philosophi that ha domin washington for far too long __PUNCT__
georg bush call it the ownership societi __PUNCT__ but it littl more than a worn dogma that sai we should give more to those at the top and hope that their good fortun trickl down to the hardwork mani __PUNCT__
for eight long year __PUNCT__ our presid sacrif invest in health care __PUNCT__ and educ __PUNCT__ and energi __PUNCT__ and infrastructur on the altar of tax break for big corpor and wealthi ceo __PUNCT__ trillion of dollar in giveawai that prove neither compassion nor conserv __PUNCT__
and for all of georg bush profess faith in free market __PUNCT__ the market have hardli been free __PUNCT__ not when the gate of washington ar thrown open to high __PUNCT__ price lobbyist who rig the rule of the road and riddl our tax code with special interest favor and corpor loophol __PUNCT__
as a result of such special __PUNCT__ interest driven polici and lax regul __PUNCT__ we haven't seen prosper trickl down to main street __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ a hous crisi that could leav up to two million homeown face foreclosur ha shaken confid in the entir economi __PUNCT__
i understand that the challeng face our economi didn't start the dai georg bush took offic and thei won't end the dai he leav __PUNCT__
some ar partli the result of forc that have global our economi over the last sever decad __PUNCT__ revolut in commun and technolog have sent job wherev there an internet connect __PUNCT__ that have forc children in raleigh and boston to compet for those job with children in bangalor and beij __PUNCT__
we live in a more competit world __PUNCT__ and that is a fact that cannot be revers __PUNCT__
but i also know that thi nation ha face such fundament chang befor __PUNCT__ and each time we kept our economi strong and competit by make the decis to expand opportun outward __PUNCT__ to grow our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ to invest in innov __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ to invest in the educ and well __PUNCT__ be of our worker __PUNCT__
we done thi becaus in america __PUNCT__ our prosper ha alwai risen from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
from the earliest dai of our found __PUNCT__ it ha been the hard work and ingenu of our peopl that serv as the wellspr of our econom strength __PUNCT__
that why we built a system of free public high school when we transit from a nation of farm to a nation of factori __PUNCT__
that why we sent my grandfath gener to colleg __PUNCT__ and declar a minimum wage for our worker __PUNCT__ and promis to live in digniti after thei retir through the creation of social secur __PUNCT__
that why we invest in the scienc and research that have led to new discoveri and entir new industri __PUNCT__
and that what thi countri will do again when i am presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we will begin thi gener elect campaign by travel across the countri for the next few week to talk about what specif we need to do to build a __NUM__ economi that work for work american __PUNCT__
i will speak with econom expert and advisor at the end of the tour __PUNCT__ but first i want to speak with you __PUNCT__ and hear about your thought and your struggl in the place where you live and work __PUNCT__
and at each stop __PUNCT__ i will take the opportun to lai out the veri real and veri seriou differ on the economi between myself and senat mccain __PUNCT__
as i said befor __PUNCT__ john mccain is an american hero whose militari servic we honor __PUNCT__
he can also legitim tout moment of independ from hi parti __PUNCT__ and on some issu __PUNCT__ such as earmark reform and climat chang __PUNCT__ he and i share goal __PUNCT__ even if we mai differ on how to get there __PUNCT__
but when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ john mccain and i have a fundament differ vision of where to take the countri __PUNCT__
becaus for all hi talk of independ __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of hi econom plan amount to a full __PUNCT__ throat endors of georg bush polici __PUNCT__
he sai we made __PUNCT__ great progress __PUNCT__ in our economi these past eight year __PUNCT__
he call himself a fiscal conserv and on the campaign trail he passion critic of govern spend __PUNCT__ and yet he ha no problem spend hundr of billion of dollar on tax break for big corpor and a perman occup of iraq __PUNCT__ polici that have left our children with a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
georg bush polici have taken us from a project __MONEY__ trillion dollar surplu at the end of the clinton administr to massiv deficit and nearli four trillion dollar in new debt todai __PUNCT__
we were promis a fiscal conserv __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we got the most fiscal irrespons administr in histori __PUNCT__
and now john mccain want to give us anoth __PUNCT__
well we been there onc __PUNCT__ and we not go back __PUNCT__
it time to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
i have a differ vision for the futur __PUNCT__
instead of spend twelv billion dollar a month to rebuild iraq __PUNCT__ i think it time we invest in our road and school and bridg and start to rebuild america __PUNCT__
instead of hand out giveawai to corpor that don't need them and didn't ask for them __PUNCT__ it time we start give a hand __PUNCT__ up to famili who ar try pai their medic bill and send their children to colleg __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of skew prioriti that give us noth but record debt __PUNCT__ we need chang that work for the american peopl __PUNCT__
and that is the choic in thi elect
my vision involv both a short __PUNCT__ term plan to help work famili who ar struggl to keep up and a long __PUNCT__ term agenda to make america competit in a global economi __PUNCT__
a week from todai __PUNCT__ i be talk about thi long __PUNCT__ term agenda in more detail __PUNCT__
it an agenda that will requir us first and foremost to train and educ our workforc with the skill necessari to compet in a knowledg __PUNCT__ base economi __PUNCT__
we also need to place a greater emphasi on area like scienc and technolog that will defin the workforc of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and invest in the research and innov necessari to creat the job and industri of the futur right here in america __PUNCT__
on place where that invest would make an enorm differ is in a renew energi polici that end our addict on foreign oil __PUNCT__ provid real long __PUNCT__ term relief from high fuel cost __PUNCT__ and build a green economi that could creat up to five million well __PUNCT__ pai job that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
we can also creat million of new job by rebuild our school __PUNCT__ road __PUNCT__ bridg __PUNCT__ and other critic infrastructur that need repair __PUNCT__
and becaus we know that we can't or shouldn't put up wall around our economi __PUNCT__ a long __PUNCT__ term agenda will also find a wai to make trade work for american worker __PUNCT__
we do the caus of free __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ a caus i believ in __PUNCT__ no good when we pass trade agreement that hand out favor to special interest and do littl to help worker who have to watch their factori close down __PUNCT__
there is noth protectionist about demand that trade spread the benefit of global as broadli as possibl __PUNCT__
that what we need to do in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
but todai i want to focu on what we must do in the short __PUNCT__ term to lift up our worker __PUNCT__ eas the struggl that so mani famili ar face right now __PUNCT__ and restor a sens of fair and balanc to our economi __PUNCT__
such relief that can't wait until the next presid take offic __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ well befor the administr seem to discov ordinari american were struggl __PUNCT__ i call for a fiscal stimulu plan to get check in the hand of hard __PUNCT__ work famili and senior __PUNCT__
congress pass such a plan and the first check ar now arriv __PUNCT__
but sinc then hundr of thousand more peopl have lost their job __PUNCT__ and so we must do more __PUNCT__
that why i call for anoth round of fiscal stimulu __PUNCT__ an immedi __MONEY__ billion to help those who been hit hardest by thi econom downturn __PUNCT__ american who have lost their job __PUNCT__ their home __PUNCT__ and ar face rise cost and cutback in state and local servic like educ and healthcar __PUNCT__
we need to expand unemploy benefit and extend them for those who can't find anoth job right awai __PUNCT__ especi sinc the long __PUNCT__ term unemploy rate is nearli twice as high as it wa dure the last recess __PUNCT__
and we must help the million of homeown who ar face foreclosur through no fault of their own __PUNCT__
as late as __DATE__ __PUNCT__ john mccain told a newspap in new hampshir that he love to offer a solut to the hous crisi __PUNCT__ but he just didn't have on __PUNCT__
it took him three differ tri to figur it out __PUNCT__ and in the end __PUNCT__ hi plan doe noth to help __NUM__ million homeown who ar face foreclosur __PUNCT__ even as he support spend billion to bail out wall street __PUNCT__
presid bush told the american peopl he thought the biggest danger aris from thi hous crisi wa the temptat to do someth about it __PUNCT__
now senat mccain want to turn bush polici of __PUNCT__ too littl __PUNCT__ too late __PUNCT__ into a polici of __PUNCT__ even less __PUNCT__ even later __PUNCT__
that not the chang we need right now __PUNCT__
that what got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
in contrast __PUNCT__ i offer a propos to crack down on mortgag fraud almost two year ago __PUNCT__ and in thi campaign i call for the immedi creation of a __MONEY__ billion foreclosur prevent fund to provid direct relief to victim of the hous crisi __PUNCT__
we also help those who ar face foreclosur refin their mortgag so thei can stai in their home at rate thei can afford __PUNCT__
i provid struggl homeown relief by offer a tax credit to low __PUNCT__ and middl __PUNCT__ incom american that would cover ten percent of their mortgag interest payment everi year __PUNCT__
the principl is simpl __PUNCT__ if the govern can bail out invest bank on wall street __PUNCT__ we can extend a hand to folk who ar struggl on main street __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i get tough on enforc __PUNCT__ rais the penalti on lender who break the rule __PUNCT__ and implement a new home score system that will allow consum to find out more about mortgag offer and whether thei be abl to make payment __PUNCT__
thi kind of transpar won't just make our homeown more secur __PUNCT__ it will make our market more stabl __PUNCT__ and keep our economi strong and competit in the futur __PUNCT__
that the chang american need __PUNCT__ and that what i do as presid __PUNCT__
as the hous crisi spill over into other part of the economi __PUNCT__ we also need to help the million of american who ar struggl under skyrocket cost and stagnant wage that ar push work famili toward a debt spiral from which thei can't escap __PUNCT__
we have to give them a wai out by lower cost __PUNCT__ put more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ and rebuild a safeti net that becom badli frai over the last few decad __PUNCT__
when it come to reliv these econom anxieti that work famili feel __PUNCT__ noth match the burden thei face from crush health care cost __PUNCT__
john mccain approach to health care mirror that of georg bush __PUNCT__
he promis four more year of a health care plan that onli take care of the healthi and the wealthi __PUNCT__ a plan that will actual make it easier __PUNCT__ easier __PUNCT__ than it alreadi is for insur compani to deni coverag to the elderli or the sick or those with pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
it mai lead million to lose the coverag thei alreadi have and million more to have to pai even more than thei do right now __PUNCT__
we can't afford that __PUNCT__
not when __NUM__ million american ar alreadi uninsur __PUNCT__ a number that is grow by the dai __PUNCT__
not when famili and busi across the countri ar be crush by the grow burden of health care cost and when half of all person bankruptci ar caus by medic bill __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we take a differ approach __PUNCT__
we will give everi american the chanc to get the same kind of health care that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
we bring down premium by __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__ and we prevent insur compani from discrimin against those who need care most __PUNCT__
and we won't just lower cost for famili __PUNCT__ we lower cost for the entir countri by make our health care system more effici through better technolog and more emphasi on prevent __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that the chang i bring as presid __PUNCT__
just as we need to reform our health care system __PUNCT__ we also have to reform a tax code that reward wealth over work __PUNCT__ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ page monstros that high __PUNCT__ price lobbyist have rig with page after page of special interest loophol and tax shelter __PUNCT__ a tax code that continu georg bush billion __PUNCT__ dollar giveawai to big corpor and wealthi ceo __PUNCT__ a tax code that ha plung thi countri deeper and deeper into debt __PUNCT__
john mccain take great pride in sai that he a fiscal conserv __PUNCT__ and he alreadi signal that he will try to defin me with the same old tax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ spend label that hi side ha been throw around for decad __PUNCT__
but let look at the fact __PUNCT__
john mccain onc said that he couldn't vote for the bush tax break in good conscienc becaus thei were too skew to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
later __PUNCT__ he said it wa irrespons to cut tax dure a time of war becaus we simpli couldn't afford them __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ noth chang about the war __PUNCT__ but someth certainli chang about john mccain __PUNCT__ becaus these same bush tax cut ar now hi central econom polici __PUNCT__
not onli that __PUNCT__ but he is now call for a new round of tax giveawai that ar twice as expens as the origin bush plan and nearli twice as regress __PUNCT__
hi polici will spend nearli __MONEY__ trillion on tax break for corpor __PUNCT__ includ __MONEY__ billion for exxon alon __PUNCT__ a compani that just record the highest profit in histori __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
at a time when we fight two war __PUNCT__ when million of american can't afford their medic bill or their tuition bill __PUNCT__ when we pai more than __MONEY__ a gallon for ga __PUNCT__ the man who rail against govern spend want to spend __MONEY__ billion on a tax break for exxon mobil __PUNCT__
that isn't just irrespons __PUNCT__
it outrag __PUNCT__
if john mccain polici were implement __PUNCT__ thei would add __MONEY__ trillion to the nation debt over the next decad __PUNCT__
that isn't fiscal conservat __PUNCT__ that what georg bush ha done over the last eight year __PUNCT__
not onli can work famili not afford it __PUNCT__ futur gener can't afford it __PUNCT__
and we can't allow it to happen in thi elect __PUNCT__
i take a differ approach __PUNCT__
i will reform our tax code so that it simpl __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and advanc opportun instead of distort the market by advanc the agenda of some lobbyist or oil compani __PUNCT__
i shut down the corpor loophol and tax haven __PUNCT__ and i us the monei to help pai for a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut that will provid __MONEY__ of relief to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__
i make oil compani like exxon pai a tax on their windfal profit __PUNCT__ and we us the monei to help famili pai for their skyrocket energi cost and other bill __PUNCT__
we also elimin incom tax for ani retire make less than __MONEY__ per year __PUNCT__ becaus everi senior deserv to live out their life in digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and while john mccain want to pick up where georg bush left off by try again to privat social secur __PUNCT__ i will never waver in my commit to protect that basic promis as presid __PUNCT__
we will not privat social secur __PUNCT__ we will not rais the retir ag __PUNCT__ and we will save social secur for futur gener by ask the wealthiest american to pai their fair share __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ contrari to what john mccain mai sai __PUNCT__ everi singl propos that i made in thi campaign is paid for __PUNCT__ becaus i believ in pai __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ go __PUNCT__
senat mccain is right that there wast in govern __PUNCT__ and i intend to root it out as presid __PUNCT__
but hi suggest that the earmark reform that we both interest in implement will somehow make up for hi enorm tax giveawai indic that john mccain wa right when he said that he doesn't understand the economi as well as he should __PUNCT__
either that or he hope you just won't notic __PUNCT__
whatev it is __PUNCT__ it not the kind of chang we need in washington right now __PUNCT__
i be talk in more detail next week about how we can make our workforc more competit by reform our educ system __PUNCT__ but there also an immedi squeez we need to deal with __PUNCT__ and that colleg afford __PUNCT__
i know how expens thi is from firsthand experi __PUNCT__
at the begin of our marriag __PUNCT__ michel and i were spend so much of our incom just to pai off our colleg loan __PUNCT__
and that wa decad ago __PUNCT__
the cost of a colleg educ ha explod sinc then __PUNCT__ price hundr of thousand of young american out of their dream everi year __PUNCT__ or forc them to begin their career in unconscion debt __PUNCT__
so i offer thi promis to everi student as presid __PUNCT__ your countri will offer you __MONEY__ a year of tuition if you offer your countri commun or nation servic when you graduat __PUNCT__
if you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__
as far as we can tell __PUNCT__ john mccain doesn't have a plan to make colleg more afford __PUNCT__
and that mean he isn't listen to the struggl face a new gener of american __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we need to help those american who find themselv in a debt spiral climb out __PUNCT__
sinc so mani who ar struggl to keep up with their mortgag ar now shift their debt to credit card __PUNCT__ we have to make sure that credit card don't becom the next stage in the hous crisi __PUNCT__
to make sure that american know what thei sign up for __PUNCT__ i institut a five __PUNCT__ star rate system to inform consum about the level of risk involv in everi credit card __PUNCT__
and we establish a credit card bill of right that will ban unilater chang to credit card agreement __PUNCT__ ban rate hike on debt you alreadi had __PUNCT__ and ban interest charg on late fee __PUNCT__
american need to pai what thei ow __PUNCT__ but you should pai what fair __PUNCT__ not just what fatten profit for some credit card compani and thei can get awai with __PUNCT__
the same principl should appli to our bankruptci law __PUNCT__
when i first arriv in the senat __PUNCT__ i oppos the credit card industri bankruptci bill that made it harder for work famili to climb out of debt __PUNCT__
john mccain support that bill __PUNCT__ and he even oppos exempt famili who were onli in bankruptci becaus of medic expens thei couldn't pai __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we reform our bankruptci law so that we give american who find themselv in debt a second chanc __PUNCT__
we make sure that if you can demonstr that you went bankrupt becaus of medic expens __PUNCT__ you can reliev that debt and get back on your feet __PUNCT__
and i make sure that ceo can't dump your pension with on hand while thei collect a bonu with the other __PUNCT__
that an outrag __PUNCT__ and it time we had a presid who know it an outrag __PUNCT__
thi is the choic you will face in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
you can vote for john mccain __PUNCT__ and see a continu of bush econom polici __PUNCT__ more tax cut to the wealthi __PUNCT__ more corpor tax break __PUNCT__ more mountain of debt __PUNCT__ and littl to no relief for famili struggl with the rise cost of everyth from health care to a colleg educ __PUNCT__
but i don't think that is the futur we want __PUNCT__
the american i met over the last sixteen month in town hall and live room __PUNCT__ on farm and front porch __PUNCT__ thei mai come from differ place and have differ background __PUNCT__ but thei hold common hope and dream the same simpl dream __PUNCT__
thei know govern can't solv all their problem __PUNCT__ and thei don't expect it to __PUNCT__
thei believ in person respons __PUNCT__ and hard work __PUNCT__ and self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__
thei don't like see their tax dollar wast __PUNCT__
but we also believ in an america where unriv prosper bring boundless opportun __PUNCT__ a place where job ar there for the will __PUNCT__ where hard work is reward with a decent live __PUNCT__ where no matter how much you start with or where you come from or who your parent ar __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
we believ in the countri that gave my grandfath and a gener of hero the chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill when thei came home from world war ii __PUNCT__ a gi bill that help creat the largest middl __PUNCT__ class in histori __PUNCT__
we believ in the countri that made it possibl for my mother __PUNCT__ a singl parent who didn't have much __PUNCT__ to send my sister and me to the best school in the countri with the help of scholarship __PUNCT__
we believ in the countri that allow my father __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ a citi worker at a water filtrat plant on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ to provid for hi wife and two children on a singl salari __PUNCT__
he wa diagnos with multipl sclerosi at ag thirti __PUNCT__ but that didn't stop him from go to work everi dai __PUNCT__ often with the help of a walker __PUNCT__ so that could send my wife and her brother to on of the best colleg in the nation __PUNCT__
hi job didn't just give him a paycheck __PUNCT__ it gave him a sens of digniti and self __PUNCT__ worth __PUNCT__
hi countri didn't just reward wealth __PUNCT__ but the work and the worker who creat it __PUNCT__
and that is the america we believ in __PUNCT__
that is the choic we face right now __PUNCT__ a choic between more of the same polici that have widen inequ __PUNCT__ ad to our debt __PUNCT__ and shaken the foundat of our economi __PUNCT__ or chang that will restor balanc to our economi __PUNCT__ that will invest in the ingenu and innov of our peopl __PUNCT__ that will fuel a bottom __PUNCT__ up prosper to keep america strong and competit in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it is not left or right __PUNCT__ liber or conserv __PUNCT__ to sai that we have tri it their wai for eight long year __PUNCT__
and it ha fail __PUNCT__
it is time to try someth new __PUNCT__
it is time for chang __PUNCT__
the challeng we face ar great __PUNCT__ and we mai not meet them in on term or with on presid __PUNCT__
but histori tell us we have met greater challeng befor __PUNCT__
and the serious of thi moment tell us we can't afford not to try __PUNCT__
so as we set out on thi journei __PUNCT__ let us also forg a new path __PUNCT__ a path that lead to unriv prosper __PUNCT__ to boundless opportun __PUNCT__ to the america we believ in and a dream that will alwai endur __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless america __PUNCT__
