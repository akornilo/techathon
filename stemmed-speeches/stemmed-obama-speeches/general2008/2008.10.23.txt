and the cost of health care and colleg tuition ha never been higher __PUNCT__
and that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__ becaus john mccain and i have real differ about how to get us out of thi econom mess __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ senat mccain think the econom polici of georg w __PUNCT__ bush ar just right for america __PUNCT__
in the senat __PUNCT__ he vote with georg bush __NUM__ percent of the time __PUNCT__
said earlier thi year that we made __PUNCT__ great progress __PUNCT__ over the last eight year __PUNCT__
and while senat mccain sai now that he differ from presid bush __PUNCT__ you sure couldn't tell by the polici he propos __PUNCT__
just yesterdai __PUNCT__ senat mccain strongli defend the bush polici of lavish tax cut on corpor that ship american job oversea __PUNCT__
he made the peculiar argument that the best wai to stop compani from ship job oversea is to give more tax cut to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
more tax cut for job outsourc __PUNCT__
that what senat mccain propos as hi answer to outsourc __PUNCT__
he said that __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ simpl fundament econom __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ indiana __PUNCT__ my oppon mai call that __PUNCT__ fundament econom __PUNCT__ but we know that just anoth name for the wall street first __PUNCT__ main street last econom philosophi we had for the past eight year __PUNCT__ and that fundament wrong __PUNCT__
if senat mccain want to defend tax break for compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ that hi choic __PUNCT__
but i sai __PUNCT__ let end tax cut for compani that ship american job oversea __PUNCT__ and give them to compani that creat good job right here in indiana __PUNCT__ in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
if he want to defend free trade agreement design to protect the profit of multin corpor and a trade polici that let countri like china tilt the plai field against our worker __PUNCT__ that up to him __PUNCT__
but i sai __PUNCT__ we need a trade polici that protect the dream of hardwork american __PUNCT__
if he want to defend a tax code that more than __NUM__ page long and fill with loophol written in by corpor lobbyist like the on run hi campaign __PUNCT__ he got everi right __PUNCT__
he ha everi right to defend offshor tax haven that let compani avoid pai tax here in america __PUNCT__
but i sai __PUNCT__ it time to close corpor loophol __PUNCT__ shut offshor tax haven __PUNCT__ and restor balanc and fair to our tax code __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ did you know that there a build in the cayman island that supposedli hous __NUM__ corpor __PUNCT__
that either the biggest build or the biggest tax scam on record __PUNCT__
and i think we know which on it is __PUNCT__
that the system my oppon defend __PUNCT__
that the system he want to preserv __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ indiana __PUNCT__ we tri it john mccain wai __PUNCT__
we tri it georg bush wai __PUNCT__
and we here todai to sai enough is enough __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of their __PUNCT__ fundament econom __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i have a differ notion of fundament econom than my oppon __PUNCT__
becaus where i come from __PUNCT__ there noth more fundament than a good __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__
there noth more fundament than be abl to pai your health care bill __PUNCT__ put your kid through colleg __PUNCT__ or retir with digniti and secur __PUNCT__
there noth more fundament than the american dream __PUNCT__ and that the dream we can reclaim if you stand with me on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
i know we can do thi __PUNCT__
i know we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus i believ in you __PUNCT__
i believ in the american peopl __PUNCT__
we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with confid __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ it written by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
but indiana __PUNCT__ i know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass the congress wa a necessari first step to eas thi credit crisi __PUNCT__ but if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ we need an immedi rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and that what i will do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
nine month ago __PUNCT__ i call for a stimulu plan to provid immedi relief for state __PUNCT__ along with tax rebat to get monei directli to middl class famili and a foreclosur prevent fund to help peopl keep their home __PUNCT__
senat mccain advisor openli mock the stimulu plan befor congress __PUNCT__ on refer to it __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ borrow monei from the chines and drop it from helicopt __PUNCT__
anoth dismiss it as __PUNCT__ junk __PUNCT__
just thi week __PUNCT__ after nine straight month of job loss __PUNCT__ when our feder reserv chairman support anoth stimulu to get our economi move __PUNCT__ senat mccain said he doesn't think we need to pass thi stimulu immedi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the work famili who been hard hit by thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ folk who can't pai their mortgag or their medic bill or send their kid to colleg __PUNCT__ thei can't afford to go to the back of the line behind ceo and wall street bank __PUNCT__
thei need help right here __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i propos a new american job tax credit for each new employe that compani hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
and i help make sure the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of tomorrow ar built not just in south korea or japan __PUNCT__ but right here in indiana __PUNCT__
few have been harder hit by our credit crisi than the worker who make our car and the compani that suppli their part __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when it came to rescu wall street __PUNCT__ washington didn't wast a minut __PUNCT__
but now that auto __PUNCT__ worker ar suffer __PUNCT__ washington put on the break __PUNCT__
it turn out it could take a year for the auto industri to get the loan guarante we pass a few week ago __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the worker who ar be laid off and the compani that ar see their sale drop __PUNCT__ thei can't afford to wait a year __PUNCT__ thei need help right now __PUNCT__
that why i call on washington to fast __PUNCT__ track those loan guarante and provid more as need __PUNCT__ becaus that how we secur our auto job and save our auto industri __PUNCT__
i also help small busi by elimin capit gain tax and give them emerg loan to keep their door open and hire worker __PUNCT__
i put a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur so that we can give homeown the breath room thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
and i will creat a job and growth fund to help state and local govern save on million job and pai for health care and educ without have to rais your tax __PUNCT__
these ar the step that we must take __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to start get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
but we also need a new set of prioriti to grow our economi and creat job over the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
it start with tax relief __PUNCT__
there been a lot of talk about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
and the truth is __PUNCT__ my oppon and i ar both propos tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to give a __MONEY__ tax cut to the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__
i want to put a middl class tax cut in the pocket of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate for middl class famili will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
it true that i want to roll back the bush tax cut on the wealthiest american and go back to the rate thei paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
john mccain call that social __PUNCT__
what he forget is that just a few year ago __PUNCT__ he himself said those bush tax cut were irrespons __PUNCT__
he said he couldn't __PUNCT__ in good conscienc __PUNCT__ support a tax cut where the benefit went to the wealthi at the expens of __PUNCT__ middl class american who most need tax relief __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he wa right then __PUNCT__ and i am right now __PUNCT__
let me be crystal clear __PUNCT__ if you make less than a quarter of a million dollar a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
that is my commit to you __PUNCT__
for the last eight year __PUNCT__ we given more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper would trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ it didn't __PUNCT__
so it time to try someth new __PUNCT__
it time to grow thi economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
it time to invest in the middl __PUNCT__ class again __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix the problem in our health care system that we been talk about for too long __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
and if i presid __PUNCT__ we give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the skill and the knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and it mean invest in agricultur educ __PUNCT__

and i want you to know that if i elect presid __PUNCT__ i will fight for you __PUNCT__ becaus america farmer ar america futur __PUNCT__
and it time we had a presid who understood that __PUNCT__
we need to make sure everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei can go to colleg __PUNCT__
my oppon top econom advisor actual said that thei have no plan to invest in colleg afford becaus we can't have a giveawai to everi special interest __PUNCT__
well i don't think the young peopl of america ar a special interest __PUNCT__ thei ar the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i make thi deal with you __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__

we will all need to tighten our belt __PUNCT__ we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
at a defin moment like thi __PUNCT__ we don't have the luxuri of reli on the same polit game and the same polit tactic that ar us everi elect to divid us from on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
with the challeng and crise we face right now __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to divid thi countri by class or region __PUNCT__ by who we ar or what polici we support __PUNCT__
there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
we ar not separ by the pro __PUNCT__ america and anti __PUNCT__ america part of thi nation __PUNCT__ we all love thi countri __PUNCT__ no matter where we live or where we come from __PUNCT__
there ar patriot who support thi war in iraq and patriot who oppos it __PUNCT__ patriot who believ in democrat polici and those who believ in republican polici __PUNCT__
the men and women from indiana and all across america who serv on our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__

and i am run for presid of the unit state of america becaus that is the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
