after decad of broken polit in washington __PUNCT__ eight year of fail polici from georg bush __PUNCT__ and twenti __PUNCT__ on month of a campaign that ha taken us from the rocki coast of main to the sunshin of california __PUNCT__ we ar on week awai from chang in america __PUNCT__
in on week __PUNCT__ you can turn the page on polici that have put the greed and irrespons of wall street befor the hard work and sacrific of folk on main street __PUNCT__
in on week __PUNCT__ you can choos polici that invest in our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ creat new job __PUNCT__ and grow thi economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up so that everyon ha a chanc to succe __PUNCT__ from the ceo to the secretari and the janitor __PUNCT__ from the factori owner to the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
in on week __PUNCT__ you can put an end to the polit that would divid a nation just to win an elect __PUNCT__ that tri to pit region against region __PUNCT__ citi against town __PUNCT__ republican against democrat __PUNCT__ that ask us to fear at a time when we need hope __PUNCT__
in on week __PUNCT__ at thi defin moment in histori __PUNCT__ you can give thi countri the chang we need __PUNCT__
we began thi journei in the depth of winter nearli two year ago __PUNCT__ on the step of the old state capitol in springfield __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ we didn't have much monei or mani endors __PUNCT__
we weren't given much of a chanc by the poll or the pundit __PUNCT__ and we knew how steep our climb would be __PUNCT__
but i also knew thi __PUNCT__
i knew that the size of our challeng had outgrown the small of our polit __PUNCT__
i believ that democrat and republican and american of everi polit stripe were hungri for new idea __PUNCT__ new leadership __PUNCT__ and a new kind of polit __PUNCT__ on that favor common sens over ideolog __PUNCT__ on that focus on those valu and ideal we hold in common as american __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ i believ in your abil to make chang happen __PUNCT__
i knew that the american peopl were a decent __PUNCT__ gener peopl who ar will to work hard and sacrific for futur gener __PUNCT__
and i wa convinc that when we come togeth __PUNCT__ our voic ar more power than the most entrench lobbyist __PUNCT__ or the most viciou polit attack __PUNCT__ or the full forc of a statu quo in washington that want to keep thing just the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
twenti __PUNCT__ on month later __PUNCT__ my faith in the american peopl ha been vindic __PUNCT__
that how we come so far and so close __PUNCT__ becaus of you __PUNCT__
that how we chang thi countri __PUNCT__ with your help __PUNCT__
and that why we can't afford to slow down __PUNCT__ sit back __PUNCT__ or let up for on dai __PUNCT__ on minut __PUNCT__ or on second in thi last week __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when so much is at stake __PUNCT__
we ar in the middl of the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
__NUM__ worker have lost their job thi year __PUNCT__
busi and famili can't get credit __PUNCT__
home valu ar fall __PUNCT__
pension ar disappear __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in a decad __PUNCT__ at a time when the cost of health care and colleg have never been higher __PUNCT__
it get harder and harder to make the mortgag __PUNCT__ or fill up your ga tank __PUNCT__ or even keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ just yesterdai __PUNCT__ we learn that despit thi crisi __PUNCT__ wall street bank execut ar set to walk awai with billion more in bonus at the end of thi year __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thei might call that a bonu on wall street __PUNCT__ but here in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ we call it an outrag __PUNCT__ and thei shouldn't be allow to get awai with it __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of the tire __PUNCT__ old theori that sai we should give more to billionair and big corpor and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
that the fail theori that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
it hasn't work __PUNCT__ and it time for chang __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in the close dai of thi campaign __PUNCT__ my oppon is try to distanc himself from the presid he ha faithfulli support __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the time __PUNCT__
he support four of the five bush budget that have taken us from the surplus of the clinton year to the largest deficit in histori __PUNCT__
john mccain ha ridden shotgun as georg bush ha driven our economi toward a cliff __PUNCT__ and now he want to take the wheel and step on the ga __PUNCT__
and when it come to the issu of tax __PUNCT__ sai that john mccain is run for a third bush term isn't be fair to georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
he propos __MONEY__ billion in new tax cut for the wealthiest american and big corpor __PUNCT__
that someth not even georg bush propos __PUNCT__
not even georg bush propos anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__
not even georg bush propos a plan that would leav out __NUM__ million middl class famili __PUNCT__
that not chang __PUNCT__
chang is a middl class tax cut for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__
chang is elimin incom tax for senior make under __MONEY__ and give homeown and work parent more of a break __PUNCT__
chang is elimin capit gain tax for the small busi that ar the engin of job __PUNCT__ creation in thi countri __PUNCT__
that what i want to do __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ there onli on candid with a plan that could eventu rais tax on million of middl class famili __PUNCT__ and it isn't me __PUNCT__
it my oppon __PUNCT__ who make you pai tax on your health care benefit for the first time ever __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it true that i want to roll back the bush tax cut on the wealthiest american and go back to the rate thei paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
but make no mistak __PUNCT__ if you make less than a quarter of a million dollar a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
becaus the last thing we should do in thi economi is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect isn't between tax cut and no tax cut __PUNCT__
it about whether you believ we should onli reward wealth __PUNCT__ or whether we should also reward the work and worker who creat it __PUNCT__
it about whether you believ in an america where opportun and success is open to anyon who will to work for it __PUNCT__
and that the america we will build togeth when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we tri it john mccain wai __PUNCT__
we tri it georg bush wai __PUNCT__
deep down __PUNCT__ senat mccain know that __PUNCT__ which is why hi campaign said that __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
that why he spend these last week call me everi name in the book __PUNCT__
becaus that how you plai the game in washington __PUNCT__
if you can't beat your oppon idea __PUNCT__ you distort those idea and mayb make some up __PUNCT__
if you don't have a record to run on __PUNCT__ then you paint your oppon as someon peopl should run awai from __PUNCT__
you make a big elect about small thing __PUNCT__
pennsylvania __PUNCT__ we ar here to sai __PUNCT__ not thi time __PUNCT__
not thi year __PUNCT__
not when so much is at stake __PUNCT__
senat mccain might be worri about lose an elect __PUNCT__ but i worri about american who ar lose their home __PUNCT__ and their job __PUNCT__ and their life save __PUNCT__
i can take on more week of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but thi countri can't take four more year of the same old polit and the same fail polici __PUNCT__
it time for someth new __PUNCT__
the question in thi elect is not __PUNCT__ ar you better off than you were four year ago __PUNCT__ we know the answer to that __PUNCT__
the real question is __PUNCT__ will thi countri be better off four year from now __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time for america __PUNCT__
but i also know that we have face difficult time befor __PUNCT__
the american stori ha never been about thing come easi __PUNCT__ it been about rise to the moment when the moment wa hard __PUNCT__
it about see the highest mountaintop from the deepest of vallei __PUNCT__
it about reject fear and divis for uniti of purpos __PUNCT__
that how we overcom war and depress __PUNCT__
that how we won great struggl for civil right and women right and worker right __PUNCT__
and that how we emerg from thi crisi stronger and more prosper than we were befor __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
rememb __PUNCT__ we still have the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth __PUNCT__
we still home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and our research facil __PUNCT__
so there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
we just need a new direct __PUNCT__
we need a new polit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't believ that govern can or should try to solv all our problem __PUNCT__
i know you don't either __PUNCT__
but i do believ that govern should do that which we cannot do for ourselv __PUNCT__ protect us from harm and provid a decent educ for our children __PUNCT__ invest in new road and new scienc and technolog __PUNCT__
it should reward drive and innov and growth in the free market __PUNCT__ but it should also make sure busi live up to their respons to creat american job __PUNCT__ and look out for american worker __PUNCT__ and plai by the rule of the road __PUNCT__
it should ensur a shot at success not onli for those with monei and power and influenc __PUNCT__ but for everi singl american who will to work __PUNCT__
that how we creat not just more millionair __PUNCT__ but more middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__
that how we make sure busi have custom that can afford their product and servic __PUNCT__
that how we alwai grown the american economi __PUNCT__ from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
john mccain call thi social __PUNCT__
i call it opportun __PUNCT__ and there is noth more american than that __PUNCT__
understand __PUNCT__ if we want get through thi crisi __PUNCT__ we need to get beyond the old ideolog debat and divid between left and right __PUNCT__
we don't need bigger govern or smaller govern __PUNCT__
we need a better govern __PUNCT__ a more compet govern __PUNCT__ a govern that uphold the valu we hold in common as american __PUNCT__
we don't have to choos between allow our financi system to collaps and spend billion of taxpay dollar to bail out wall street bank __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will ensur that the financi rescu plan help stop foreclosur and protect your monei instead of enrich ceo __PUNCT__
and i will put in place the common __PUNCT__ sens regul i been call for throughout thi campaign so that wall street can never caus a crisi like thi again __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
when it come to job __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect is not between put up a wall around america or allow everi job to disappear oversea __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ we won't be abl to bring back everi job that we lost __PUNCT__ but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain plan to keep give tax break to corpor that send american job oversea __PUNCT__
i will end those break as presid __PUNCT__ and i will give american busi a __MONEY__ tax credit for everi job thei creat right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we creat two million new job by rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ and school __PUNCT__ and by lai broadband line to reach everi corner of the countri __PUNCT__
and i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new energi job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and a new electr grid __PUNCT__ job build the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of tomorrow __PUNCT__ not in japan or south korea but here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ job that will help us elimin the oil we import from the middl east in ten year and help save the planet in the bargain __PUNCT__
that how america can lead again __PUNCT__
when it come to health care __PUNCT__ we don't have to choos between a govern __PUNCT__ run health care system and the unafford on we have now __PUNCT__
if you alreadi have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
and as someon who watch hi own mother spend the final month of her life argu with insur compani becaus thei claim her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__ i will stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
when it come to give everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ so thei can compet in thi global economi for the job of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ the choic is not between more monei and more reform __PUNCT__ becaus our school need both __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ pai them more __PUNCT__ and give them more support __PUNCT__
but i will also demand higher standard and more account from our teacher and our school __PUNCT__
and i will make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
i won't stand here and pretend that ani of thi will be easi __PUNCT__ especi now __PUNCT__
the cost of thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ and the cost of the war in iraq __PUNCT__ mean that washington will have to tighten it belt and put off spend on thing we can afford to do without __PUNCT__
on thi __PUNCT__ there is no other choic __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will go through the feder budget __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ end program that we don't need and make the on we do need work better and cost less __PUNCT__
but as i said from the dai we began thi journei all those month ago __PUNCT__ the chang we need isn't just about new program and polici __PUNCT__
it about a new polit __PUNCT__ a polit that call on our better angel instead of encourag our worst instinct __PUNCT__ on that remind us of the oblig we have to ourselv and on anoth __PUNCT__
part of the reason thi econom crisi occur is becaus we have been live through an era of profound irrespons __PUNCT__
on wall street __PUNCT__ easi monei and an ethic of __PUNCT__ what good for me is good enough __PUNCT__ blind greedi execut to the danger in the decis thei were make __PUNCT__
on main street __PUNCT__ lender trick peopl into bui home thei couldn't afford __PUNCT__
some folk knew thei couldn't afford those hous and bought them anywai __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ politician spent monei thei didn't have and allow lobbyist to set the agenda __PUNCT__
thei score polit point instead of solv our problem __PUNCT__ and even after the greatest attack on american soil sinc pearl harbor __PUNCT__ all we were ask to do by our presid wa to go out and shop __PUNCT__
that is why what we have lost in these last eight year cannot be measur by lost wage or bigger trade deficit alon __PUNCT__
what ha also been lost is the idea that in thi american stori __PUNCT__ each of us ha a role to plai __PUNCT__
each of us ha a respons to work hard and look after ourselv and our famili __PUNCT__ and each of us ha a respons to our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
that what been lost these last eight year __PUNCT__ our sens of common purpos __PUNCT__ of higher purpos __PUNCT__
and that what we need to restor right now __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ govern must lead the wai on energi independ __PUNCT__ but each of us must do our part to make our home and our busi more effici __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we must provid more ladder to success for young men who fall into live of crime and despair __PUNCT__
but all of us must do our part as parent to turn off the televis and read to our children and take respons for provid the love and guidanc thei need __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we can argu and debat our posit passion __PUNCT__ but at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridg our differ and unit in common effort __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ gai and straight __PUNCT__ disabl or not __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ we cannot afford the same polit game and tactic that ar be us to pit us against on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
the stake ar too high to divid us by class and region and background __PUNCT__ by who we ar or what we believ __PUNCT__
becaus despit what our oppon mai claim __PUNCT__ there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
there is no citi or town that is more pro __PUNCT__ america than anywher els __PUNCT__ we ar on nation __PUNCT__ all of us proud __PUNCT__ all of us patriot __PUNCT__
there ar patriot who support thi war in iraq and patriot who oppos it __PUNCT__ patriot who believ in democrat polici and those who believ in republican polici __PUNCT__
the men and women who serv in our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ pennsylvania __PUNCT__
it won't be quick __PUNCT__
but you and i know that it is time to come togeth and chang thi countri __PUNCT__
some of you mai be cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
a lot of you mai be disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what ha been ask of american throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ not just in my abil to bring about chang __PUNCT__ but in your __PUNCT__
i know thi chang is possibl __PUNCT__
becaus i have seen it over the last twenti __PUNCT__ on month __PUNCT__
becaus in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i have had the privileg to wit what is best in america __PUNCT__
i seen it in line of voter that stretch around school and church __PUNCT__ in the young peopl who cast their ballot for the first time __PUNCT__ and those not so young folk who got involv again after a veri long time __PUNCT__
i seen it in the worker who would rather cut back their hour than see their friend lose their job __PUNCT__ in the neighbor who take a stranger in when the floodwat rise __PUNCT__ in the soldier who re __PUNCT__ enlist after lose a limb __PUNCT__
i seen it in the face of the men and women i met at countless ralli and town hall across the countri __PUNCT__ men and women who speak of their struggl but also of their hope and dream __PUNCT__
i still rememb the email that a woman name robyn sent me after i met her in ft __PUNCT__ lauderdal __PUNCT__
sometim after our event __PUNCT__ her son nearli went into cardiac arrest __PUNCT__ and wa diagnos with a heart condit that could onli be treat with a procedur that cost ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
her insur compani refus to pai __PUNCT__ and their famili just didn't have that kind of monei __PUNCT__
in her email __PUNCT__ robyn wrote __PUNCT__ i ask onli thi of you __PUNCT__ on the dai where you feel so tire you can't think of utter anoth word to the peopl __PUNCT__ think of us __PUNCT__

if we will to work for it __PUNCT__
if we will to shed our fear and our doubt __PUNCT__
if we will to reach deep down insid ourselv when we tire and come back fight harder __PUNCT__
hope __PUNCT__ that what kept some of our parent and grandpar go when time were tough __PUNCT__
what led them to sai __PUNCT__ mayb i can't go to colleg __PUNCT__ but if i save a littl bit each week my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but if i work realli hard my child can open on of her own __PUNCT__
it what led immigr from distant land to come to these shore against great odd and carv a new life for their famili in america __PUNCT__ what led those who couldn't vote to march and organ and stand for freedom __PUNCT__ that led them to cry out __PUNCT__ it mai look dark tonight __PUNCT__ but if i hold on to hope __PUNCT__ tomorrow will be brighter __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
that is the choic we face right now __PUNCT__
don't believ for a second thi elect is over __PUNCT__
don't think for a minut that power conced __PUNCT__
we have to work like our futur depend on it in thi last week __PUNCT__ becaus it doe __PUNCT__
