you ar meet at a time of great turmoil for the american economi __PUNCT__
we ar now confront with a financi crisi as seriou as ani we have face sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
action must be taken to restor confid in our economi __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ it outrag that we find ourselv in a posit where taxpay must bear the burden for the greed and irrespons of wall street and washington __PUNCT__
but we also know that a failur to act would have grave consequ for the job __PUNCT__ and save __PUNCT__ and retir of the american peopl __PUNCT__
over the last few dai __PUNCT__ i been in close contact with secretari paulson and leader in congress __PUNCT__
i also had the opportun to speak directli to the american peopl about what we need to do move forward __PUNCT__
i laid out sever clear principl that i believ must be a part of our respons to thi crisi __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to set up an independ board __PUNCT__ select by democrat and republican __PUNCT__ to provid oversight and account for how and where thi monei is spent at everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ if american taxpay financ thi solut __PUNCT__ thei should be treat like investor __PUNCT__
that mean wall street and washington should give everi penni of taxpay __PUNCT__ monei back onc thi economi recov __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we cannot and will not simpli bailout wall street without help the million of innoc homeown who ar struggl to stai in their home __PUNCT__
thei deserv a plan too __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ and thi is import __PUNCT__ the american peopl should not be spend on dime to reward the same wall street ceo whose greed and irrespons got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
congression leader have made progress in their negoti __PUNCT__ and appear close to a deal that would includ these principl __PUNCT__
presid bush address some of these issu last night __PUNCT__ and i pleas that senat mccain ha decid to embrac them too __PUNCT__
now is a time to come togeth __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ in a spirit of cooper on behalf of the american peopl __PUNCT__
later todai __PUNCT__ i be travel to washington to offer my help in get thi deal done __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ i travel to oxford on fridai for the first of our presidenti debat __PUNCT__
our elect is in __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
our economi is in crisi __PUNCT__ and our nation is fight two war abroad __PUNCT__
the american peopl deserv to hear directli from myself and senat mccain about how we intend to lead our countri __PUNCT__
the time ar too seriou to put our campaign on hold __PUNCT__ or to ignor the full rang of issu that the next presid will face __PUNCT__
sinc cgi is about deed __PUNCT__ not just word __PUNCT__ let me tell you about four specif commit that i will make on four issu that cgi ha focus on __PUNCT__ climat chang __PUNCT__ poverti __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and health __PUNCT__ if i have the opportun to serv as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
here how i approach these issu __PUNCT__
we live in a time when our destini ar share __PUNCT__
the world is more intertwin than at ani time in human histori __PUNCT__
wall that divid old enemi have come down __PUNCT__
market have open __PUNCT__
the spread of inform and technolog ha reduc barrier to opportun and prosper __PUNCT__ and open door to new competit and risk __PUNCT__
we have heard thi time and again sinc the end of the cold war __PUNCT__
and over the last few week __PUNCT__ thi truth ha been reinforc anew __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ we have seen that there is no divid line between the abil of folk to live their dream on main street __PUNCT__ and the bottom line of invest bank on wall street __PUNCT__
there is a lesson that cut across thi econom crisi __PUNCT__
prosper cannot be sustain if it shut peopl out __PUNCT__
growth cannot just come from the top down __PUNCT__ it must come from the bottom up __PUNCT__ with new job that pai good wage __PUNCT__ and new innov that creat opportun across the globe __PUNCT__
and in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we must also recogn that it not just prosper that come from the bottom up __PUNCT__
our secur is share as well __PUNCT__
the carbon emiss in boston or beij don't just pollut the immedi atmospher __PUNCT__ thei imperil our planet __PUNCT__
pocket of extrem poverti in somalia can breed conflict that spill across border __PUNCT__
the child who goe to a radic madrasa outsid of karachi can end up endang the secur of my daughter in chicago __PUNCT__
a deadli flu that begin in indonesia can find it wai to indiana within dai __PUNCT__
climat chang __PUNCT__
poverti __PUNCT__
extrem __PUNCT__
diseas __PUNCT__
these problem offend our common human __PUNCT__
thei also threaten our common secur __PUNCT__
you know thi __PUNCT__
the question is what we do about it __PUNCT__
we not go to face these threat of the futur by grasp at the idea of the past __PUNCT__
in mani case __PUNCT__ we know what we have to do __PUNCT__
we talk about the solut year after year __PUNCT__
thi must be the time when we choos not to wait ani longer __PUNCT__
we must marshal the will __PUNCT__
we must see that none of these problem can be dealt with in isol __PUNCT__ nor can we deni on and effect tackl anoth __PUNCT__
that why you come to cgi __PUNCT__
becaus that what thi moment call us to do __PUNCT__
no singl issu sit at the crossroad of as mani current as energi __PUNCT__
our depend on oil and ga fund terror and tyranni __PUNCT__ it ha forc famili to pai their wage at the pump __PUNCT__ and it put the futur of our planet in peril __PUNCT__
thi is a secur threat __PUNCT__ an econom albatross __PUNCT__ and a moral challeng of our time __PUNCT__
the time to debat whether climat chang is manmad ha past __PUNCT__ it time __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ for america to lead __PUNCT__
the first commit that i make todai is set a goal of an __NUM__ percent reduct in greenhous ga emiss by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
to do our part __PUNCT__ we implement a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade program so that there a price for pollut __PUNCT__ and resourc to transform our energi economi __PUNCT__
i propos an invest of __MONEY__ billion in altern energi over ten year __PUNCT__ which will creat million of job and break the cycl of our addict to oil __PUNCT__
we need to do more than drill __PUNCT__
now is the time to develop everi form of altern energi __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ and biofuel __PUNCT__ as well as technolog that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe __PUNCT__
we need to rais fuel economi standard __PUNCT__ put more plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid car on the road __PUNCT__ and find new wai to be energi effici __PUNCT__
abroad __PUNCT__ the unit state must get off the sidelin __PUNCT__
we reach out to the leader of the biggest carbon emit nation and ask them to join a new global energi forum to lai the foundat for the next gener of climat protocol __PUNCT__
we build an allianc of oil __PUNCT__ import nation __PUNCT__ and work togeth to reduc our demand __PUNCT__ and break the grip of opec __PUNCT__
and as we develop clean energi __PUNCT__ we should share technolog and innov with the nation of the world __PUNCT__
thi effort to confront climat chang will be part of our strategi to allevi poverti __PUNCT__
becaus we know that it is the world poor who will feel __PUNCT__ and who mai alreadi be feel __PUNCT__ the affect of a warm planet __PUNCT__
if we fail to act __PUNCT__ famin could displac hundr of million __PUNCT__ fuel competit and conflict over basic resourc like food and water __PUNCT__
we all have a stake in reduc poverti __PUNCT__
there is suffer across the globe that doesn't need to be toler in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and it lead to pocket of instabl that provid fertil breed ground for threat like terror and the smuggl of deadli weapon that cannot be contain by the draw of a border or the distanc of an ocean __PUNCT__
these aren't simpli disconnect corner of an interconnect world __PUNCT__
that is why the second commit that i will make is embrac the millennium develop goal __PUNCT__ which aim to cut extrem poverti in half by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi will take more resourc from the unit state __PUNCT__ and as presid i will increas our foreign assist to provid them __PUNCT__
but resourc must be focus on the right prioriti __PUNCT__
no on want to put good monei after bad __PUNCT__ or ignor the underli caus at the root of these problem __PUNCT__
we shouldn't just settl for a statu quo __PUNCT__ anywher __PUNCT__ where you can't start a busi without pai a bribe __PUNCT__
corrupt wast our tax dollar __PUNCT__
it also ruin live __PUNCT__
thi is a human right issu __PUNCT__ and we need to treat it like on __PUNCT__
we shouldn't help those in need without help them help themselv __PUNCT__
that why i partner with the privat sector in creat a new fund for small and medium enterpris __PUNCT__ so we invest in idea that can creat growth and job in the develop world __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ we must do our part to see that all children have the basic right to learn __PUNCT__
there is noth more disappoint than a child deni the hope that come with go to school __PUNCT__ and there is noth more danger than a child who is taught to distrust and then to destroi __PUNCT__
that why the third commit i make is work to eras the global primari educ gap by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
everi child __PUNCT__ everi boi __PUNCT__ and everi girl __PUNCT__ should have the abil to go to school __PUNCT__
to ensur that our nation doe it part to meet that goal __PUNCT__ we need to establish a two billion dollar global educ fund __PUNCT__
and i look forward to sign the bipartisan educ for all act that wa first introduc by hillari clinton __PUNCT__ a true champion for children __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we must continu the progress that been made to advanc the caus of global health __PUNCT__
i been proud to support the pepfar program __PUNCT__
i think presid bush __PUNCT__ and mani of you there todai __PUNCT__ have shown real leadership in the fight against hiv/aid __PUNCT__ tuberculosi __PUNCT__ and malaria __PUNCT__
thi is a fight that i will continu as presid __PUNCT__
diseas stand in the wai of progress on so mani front __PUNCT__
it can condemn popul to poverti __PUNCT__ and prevent a child from get an educ __PUNCT__
and yet far too mani peopl still die of prevent ill __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i like to focu on on __PUNCT__ malaria __PUNCT__
we have elimin malaria in the unit state __PUNCT__ but nearli on million peopl around the world still die from a mosquito bite everi year __PUNCT__
__NUM__ percent of the victim ar african children under the ag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in africa __PUNCT__ a child di from a mosquito bite everi thirti second __PUNCT__
beyond the devast human toll __PUNCT__ malaria weigh down public health system __PUNCT__ set back global capac to fight other diseas __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ i want to join with the global malaria commun that is meet here in new york in make a new commit __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will set the goal of end all death from malaria by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it time to rid the world of death from a diseas that doesn't have to take live __PUNCT__
the unit state must lead __PUNCT__ and when i am presid we will step up our focu on prevent and treatment around the world to get thi done __PUNCT__
the first project of my small and medium enterpris fund will be invest in the develop world capac to meet the demand for __NUM__ million bednet __PUNCT__
we also increas access to doctor and nurs through a new program __PUNCT__ health infrastructur __NUM__ __PUNCT__ that train medic profession in countri around the world __PUNCT__ and give them incent to stai there __PUNCT__
and we invest in research and develop into new vaccin __PUNCT__ and ensur that low cost anti __PUNCT__ malaria drug ar avail everywher __PUNCT__
thi effort must bring togeth govern from around the world __PUNCT__
it must be a public __PUNCT__ privat partnership that draw on the resourc __PUNCT__ and idea __PUNCT__ and resili of busi and non __PUNCT__ profit and faith group __PUNCT__
it must be a caus for countless individu __PUNCT__ and a common goal that unit us all __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ the effort to erad malaria must draw on the spirit that drive not simpli the commit at cgi __PUNCT__ but the commit that is visibl everywher that peopl go to work to make their commun __PUNCT__ their countri __PUNCT__ and our world a better place __PUNCT__
the scale of our challeng mai be great __PUNCT__
the pace of chang mai be swift __PUNCT__
but we know that it need not be fear __PUNCT__
the landscap of the __NUM__ centuri ar still our to shape __PUNCT__
we see the potenti for progress everi time someon start a job creat new energi __PUNCT__ or an idea carri a commun out of poverti __PUNCT__ we see it everi time a girl walk through the door of a new school __PUNCT__ or a boi live to see anoth dai becaus he had a simpl net around hi bed __PUNCT__
these ar the dream that we must make our own __PUNCT__
we live in a time when our destini ar share __PUNCT__
but our destini will be written by us __PUNCT__ not for us __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it fall to us to get to work __PUNCT__
