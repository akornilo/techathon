we meet at a moment when thi countri is face a set of challeng unlik ani we ever known __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ our brave men and women in uniform ar fight two differ war while terrorist plot their next attack __PUNCT__
our chang climat is put our planet in peril and our secur at risk __PUNCT__
and our economi is in turmoil __PUNCT__ with more and more of our famili struggl with rise cost __PUNCT__ fall incom __PUNCT__ and lost job __PUNCT__
so we know that thi elect could be the most import of our lifetim __PUNCT__
we know that the choic we make in __DATE__ and over the next few year will shape the next decad __PUNCT__ if not the centuri __PUNCT__
and central to each of these challeng is the question of what we will do about our addict to foreign oil __PUNCT__
without a doubt __PUNCT__ thi addict is on of the most urgent threat we ever face __PUNCT__ from the ga price that ar wipe out your paycheck and strain busi __PUNCT__ to the job that ar disappear from thi state __PUNCT__ from the instabl and terror bred in the middl east __PUNCT__ to the rise ocean __PUNCT__ record drought __PUNCT__ and spread famin that could engulf our planet __PUNCT__
how __PUNCT__ exactli __PUNCT__ did we get to thi point __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you won't hear me sai thi too often __PUNCT__ but i couldn't agre more with the explan that senat mccain offer a few week ago __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ our danger depend on foreign oil ha been thirti year in the make __PUNCT__ and wa caus by the failur of politician in washington to think long __PUNCT__ term about the futur of the countri __PUNCT__
what senat mccain neglect to mention wa that dure those thirti year __PUNCT__ he wa in washington for twenti __PUNCT__ six of them __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ yesterdai __PUNCT__ senat mccain start run a tv ad sai that washington is broken __PUNCT__
no kid __PUNCT__
it onli took senat mccain those __NUM__ year in washington to figur that out __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ elkhart __PUNCT__
i have a littl troubl squar that statement with senat mccain declar a few month ago that we made __PUNCT__ great progress econom __PUNCT__ over the past eight year __PUNCT__
or hi boast that he vote with presid bush over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the time __PUNCT__
or hi assert that overal __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar better off now than thei were when georg w __PUNCT__ bush came into offic __PUNCT__
you know from your own live that we not better off than we were eight year ago __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ you were pai about __MONEY__ for ga __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ you pai around __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ you were pai __MONEY__ a year on electr bill __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ you pai more than __MONEY__
back then __PUNCT__ you were pai about __MONEY__ for heat oil to get you through the winter __PUNCT__
thi winter __PUNCT__ you like to pai nearli __MONEY__
thi didn't happen by accid __PUNCT__
it happen becaus for too long __PUNCT__ we haven't had a real energi plan in thi countri __PUNCT__
we had an oil compani plan __PUNCT__
we had a ga compani plan __PUNCT__
but we haven't had a plan that made sens for the american peopl __PUNCT__
so if senat mccain want to talk about why washington is broken __PUNCT__ that a debat i happi to have __PUNCT__
becaus senat mccain energi plan read like an earli christma list for oil and ga lobbyist __PUNCT__
and it no wonder __PUNCT__ becaus mani of hi top advisor ar former oil and ga lobbyist __PUNCT__
instead of offer a plan with signific invest in altern energi __PUNCT__ he offer a ga tax gimmick that will pad oil compani profit and save you __PUNCT__ at most __PUNCT__ a quarter and a nickel a dai over the cours of an entir summer __PUNCT__
that why washington is broken __PUNCT__
instead of support my plan to us the windfal profit of oil compani to help you pai rise cost __PUNCT__ he offer __MONEY__ billion more in tax break to oil compani like exxon that just made the largest quarterli profit in the histori of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that why washington is broken __PUNCT__
instead of offer a comprehens plan that will lower ga price __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of hi entir energi plan is more drill __PUNCT__
it a propos that won't yield a drop of oil for at least seven year __PUNCT__ but it produc a gusher for senat mccain __PUNCT__
becaus after he announc hi drill propos to a room full of oil execut __PUNCT__ the industri poni up nearli a million dollar in contribut __PUNCT__
that the kind of special interest __PUNCT__ driven polit that stop us from solv our energi crisi __PUNCT__
and that why washington is broken __PUNCT__
so i know senat mccain like to call himself a maverick __PUNCT__ and the fact is __PUNCT__ there ar time when he shown independ from hi parti in the past __PUNCT__
but the price he paid for hi parti nomin wa to revers himself on posit after posit __PUNCT__ and now he embrac the fail bush polici and polit that help break washington in the first place __PUNCT__ and that doesn't exactli meet my definit of a maverick __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ while we on the subject of senat mccain contradict himself __PUNCT__ a few dai ago someon ask me what thei could do to help america save energi __PUNCT__
i suggest that we could get better ga mileag in our car and save oil in the process just by keep our tire inflat __PUNCT__ and expert agre __PUNCT__
but senat mccain and hi parti mock the idea __PUNCT__ and thei even sent out tire gaug __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ get thi __PUNCT__ last night __PUNCT__ after all that __PUNCT__ senat mccain actual said that he agre that keep our tire inflat wa a good idea __PUNCT__
we just agre to a seri of debat in the fall __PUNCT__ but the most interest on that go on these dai is the debat between john mccain and john mccain
but understand __PUNCT__ thi isn't just about tire gaug and it isn't just about a singl tv ad __PUNCT__ no matter how mislead it is __PUNCT__
it about everyon in thi room __PUNCT__
it about your live and your famili futur __PUNCT__
becaus you know that what we been do for the past eight year hasn't work __PUNCT__ and that we can't afford anoth four year of the fail polici that we had under georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
and if you need on more exampl of what wrong with our energi polici or the bush polici in gener __PUNCT__ there a new report out sai that iraq ha hit a windfal becaus of high oil price __PUNCT__
thei have a __MONEY__ billion budget surplu at a time when were spend __MONEY__ billion a month to defend and rebuild that countri __PUNCT__
their monei is not be invest in servic for suffer iraqi or reconstruct __PUNCT__
while some of their monei is sit in american bank __PUNCT__ american monei is be spent over there __PUNCT__
it time for iraqi to take respons for rebuild their own countri __PUNCT__ and it time for us to address own concern here at home __PUNCT__
that why earlier thi week i laid out a plan to help end the ag of oil in our time __PUNCT__
here how we do it __PUNCT__
in the short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ as we transit to renew energi __PUNCT__ we can and should increas our domest product of oil and natur ga __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ oil compani have access to __NUM__ million acr where thei aren't drill __PUNCT__
so we should start by give them a choic __PUNCT__ us the land you have __PUNCT__ or give up your leas to someon who will __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ thi won't serious reduc our energi depend in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
we simpli cannot pretend __PUNCT__ as senat mccain doe __PUNCT__ that we can drill our wai out of thi problem __PUNCT__
break our oil addict will take noth less than a complet transform of our economi __PUNCT__
it will take an all __PUNCT__ hand __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ deck effort from america __PUNCT__ effort from our scientist and entrepreneur __PUNCT__ from busi and from everi american citizen __PUNCT__
we all know that thi is the great challeng of our time __PUNCT__
but it also a great opportun becaus if we can seiz thi moment __PUNCT__ we can open the door to a new economi for the __NUM__ centuri that will bring new energi __PUNCT__ new job __PUNCT__ and new hope to famili in place like elkhart __PUNCT__
that why i vote for an energi bill in the senat that wa far from perfect __PUNCT__ and that includ tax giveawai to oil compani that i fought to elimin __PUNCT__ but that also repres the singl largest invest in renew energi in histori __PUNCT__
and that why if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will put the full resourc of the feder govern and the full energi of the privat sector behind a singl __PUNCT__ overarch goal __PUNCT__ in ten year __PUNCT__ we will elimin the need for oil from the entir middl east and venezuela __PUNCT__
to do thi __PUNCT__ we invest __MONEY__ billion over the next decad and leverag billion more in privat capit to har american energi and creat five million new american job __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ good union job that lift up our famili and commun __PUNCT__
there ar three major step i take to achiev thi goal __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we commit ourselv to get on million __NUM__ mile __PUNCT__ per __PUNCT__ gallon plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid car on our road within six year __PUNCT__
and we make sure that the car of tomorrow ar built not just in japan or china __PUNCT__ but right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we doubl the amount of our energi that come from renew sourc by the end of my first term __PUNCT__
that mean invest in renew like wind and solar power __PUNCT__ and we also invest in the next gener biofuel __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i will call on busi __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ and the american peopl to meet the goal of reduc our demand for electr __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by the end of the next decad __PUNCT__
thi is by far the fastest __PUNCT__ easiest __PUNCT__ and cheapest wai to reduc our energi consumpt __PUNCT__ and it will save us __MONEY__ billion on our energi bill __PUNCT__
in just ten year __PUNCT__ these three step will produc enough renew energi to replac all the oil we import from the middl east and venezuela __PUNCT__
i won't pretend these goal aren't ambiti __PUNCT__
thei ar __PUNCT__
i won't pretend we can achiev them without cost __PUNCT__ or without sacrific __PUNCT__ or without the contribut of almost everi american citizen __PUNCT__
we can't __PUNCT__
but i will sai that these goal ar possibl __PUNCT__
and i will sai that achiev them is absolut necessari if we want to keep america safe and prosper in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it necessari if we want our famili to thrive again __PUNCT__ to have good job with good wage that let them get ahead again __PUNCT__
so in thi elect __PUNCT__ we face a choic __PUNCT__
we can keep pai more and more at the pump __PUNCT__ and send our hard __PUNCT__ earn dollar to oil compani execut and middl eastern dictat __PUNCT__
we can watch helplessli as the price of ga rise and fall becaus of some foreign crisi we have no control over __PUNCT__ and uncov everi singl barrel of oil buri beneath thi countri onli to realiz that we don't have enough for a few year __PUNCT__ let alon a centuri __PUNCT__
or we can choos anoth futur __PUNCT__
in just a few year __PUNCT__ we can watch car that run on plug __PUNCT__ in batteri come off our assembl line __PUNCT__
we can see shutter factori open their door to manufactur that sell wind turbin and solar panel that will power our home and our busi __PUNCT__
we can watch as million of new job with good pai and good benefit ar creat for american worker __PUNCT__ and we can take pride as the technolog __PUNCT__ and discoveri __PUNCT__ and industri of the futur flourish in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we can lead the world __PUNCT__ secur our nation __PUNCT__ and leav our children a planet that is safer and cleaner and healthier than the on we inherit __PUNCT__
thi is the choic we face in the month ahead __PUNCT__
thi is the challeng we must meet __PUNCT__
thi is the opportun we must seiz __PUNCT__ and thi mai be our last chanc to seiz it __PUNCT__
so i ask you to join me in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and in the year to come __PUNCT__ to ensur that we not onli control our own energi __PUNCT__ but that we bring about a new and better futur for our hardwork famili and for thi countri that we love __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
