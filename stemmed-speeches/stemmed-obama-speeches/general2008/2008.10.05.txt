it wa the ninth straight month of job loss __PUNCT__ more than three quarter of a million thi year __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ here in north carolina __PUNCT__
and it came just as we finish a week in which our financi market teeter on the brink of disast __PUNCT__
yet instead of address these crise __PUNCT__ senat mccain campaign ha announc that thei plan to turn the page on the discuss about our economi and spend the final week of thi campaign launch swiftboat __PUNCT__ style attack on me __PUNCT__
think about that for a second __PUNCT__
turn the page on the economi __PUNCT__ we face the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ and john mccain want us to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i know the polici he support these past eight year and want to continu ar pretti hard to defend __PUNCT__
i can understand why senat mccain would want to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ and ignor thi economi __PUNCT__
but i also know thi __PUNCT__
you try to pai your bill everi week and stai abov the water __PUNCT__ you can't ignor it __PUNCT__
you worri about whether your job will be there a month from now __PUNCT__ you can't ignor it __PUNCT__

in __NUM__ dai you ar go to elect the next presid __PUNCT__ and you need and deserv a presid who is go to wake up everi dai and fight for you __PUNCT__ and fight for the middl class __PUNCT__ and fight to creat job and grow our economi again __PUNCT__ not anoth presid who doesn't get it __PUNCT__
not anoth presid who ignor our problem __PUNCT__
not more of the same __PUNCT__
senat mccain and hi oper ar gambl that he can distract you with smear rather than talk to you about substanc __PUNCT__
thei rather try to tear our campaign down than lift thi countri up __PUNCT__
it what you do when you out of touch __PUNCT__ out of idea __PUNCT__ and run out of time __PUNCT__
i want you to know that i go to keep on talk about the issu that matter __PUNCT__ about the economi and health care and educ and energi __PUNCT__
i go to keep on stand up for hard work famili __PUNCT__
we not go to let john mccain distract us from what we need to do to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
becaus __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you and i ar go to turn the page on the disastr econom polici of georg w __PUNCT__ bush and john mccain __PUNCT__
and on of the issu we must face and can't ignor is the explos of health care cost that is crush famili and busi across our countri __PUNCT__
understand __PUNCT__ thi is veri person to me __PUNCT__
i think todai about my mother __PUNCT__
she di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
she fought valiantli __PUNCT__ and endur the pain and chemotherapi with grace and good humor __PUNCT__
but i never forget how she spent the final month of her life __PUNCT__
at a time when she should have been focus on get well __PUNCT__ at a time when she should have been take stock of her life and take comfort in her famili __PUNCT__ she wa ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei didn't want to cover her treatment __PUNCT__
thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
so i know someth about the heartbreak caus by our health care system __PUNCT__
i know someth about the anxieti of famili hang on by a thread as premium have doubl __PUNCT__ and debt pile up __PUNCT__ and more than half __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__ of all person bankruptci ar caus in part by medic bill __PUNCT__
i know about the frustrat of the nearli __NUM__ percent of small busi owner who can no longer afford to insur their employe __PUNCT__ folk who work dai and night __PUNCT__ but have to lai peopl off __PUNCT__ or shut their door for good __PUNCT__ becaus of rise health care cost __PUNCT__
i know the outrag we all feel about the __NUM__ million american who don't have health insur __PUNCT__ kid who can't see a doctor when thei sick __PUNCT__ parent cut their pill in half and prai for the best __PUNCT__ folk who wind up in the emerg room in the middl of the night becaus thei got nowher els to turn __PUNCT__
but i also know that thi is not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri where a young woman i met should have to work the night shift after a full dai of colleg and still not be abl to pai the medic bill for her sister who ill __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__ and it not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri where a man i met should have to file for bankruptci after he had a stroke __PUNCT__ becaus he face nearli __MONEY__ in medic cost that he couldn't afford and hi insur compani didn't cover __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__ and it not who we ar __PUNCT__
that is not who we ar __PUNCT__ and that is not who we have to be __PUNCT__
enough is enough __PUNCT__ it time for chang __PUNCT__
now i know that at thi moment __PUNCT__ when we stand in the midst of a seriou econom crisi __PUNCT__ some might ask how we can afford to focu on health care __PUNCT__
major financi institut have collaps __PUNCT__
famili across america ar struggl __PUNCT__
and it clear that the rescu packag we just pass in congress isn't the end of what we need to do to fix our economi __PUNCT__ it just the begin __PUNCT__
becaus contrari to what senat mccain sai __PUNCT__ the fundament of our economi ar still not strong __PUNCT__
and we got to address those fundament right now __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ the question isn't how we can afford to focu on health care __PUNCT__ but how we can afford not to __PUNCT__
becaus in order to fix our econom crisi __PUNCT__ we need to fix our health care system too __PUNCT__
let not forget __PUNCT__ it not just small busi and famili who ar suffer __PUNCT__
some of the largest corpor in america __PUNCT__ includ major american car maker __PUNCT__ ar fight to compet becaus of high health care cost __PUNCT__
thei watch their foreign competitor prosper __PUNCT__ unburden by these cost __PUNCT__ as thei struggl to creat the good job we need to get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
so it clear that the time ha come __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to solv thi problem __PUNCT__ to cut health care cost for famili and busi __PUNCT__ and provid afford __PUNCT__ access health insur for everi american __PUNCT__
and you think that anyon run for presid would understand thi __PUNCT__
you think ani candid for the highest offic in the land would have a plan to achiev these critic import goal __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ if you think that __PUNCT__ you haven't met my oppon __PUNCT__ senat john mccain __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it not that he doesn't care about what peopl ar go through __PUNCT__
i just think he doesn't know __PUNCT__
that the onli reason i can think of that he propos a health care plan that is so radic __PUNCT__ so out of touch with what you face __PUNCT__ and so out of line with our basic valu __PUNCT__
it start with hi propos to deregul our insur industri and leav famili across america without the basic protect thei reli on __PUNCT__
you mai have heard about how __PUNCT__ in the current issu of a magazin __PUNCT__ senat mccain wrote that we need to open up health care to __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ more vigor nationwid competit as we have done over the last decad in bank __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ he want to deregul the insur industri just like he fought to deregul the bank industri __PUNCT__
and we all seen how well that work out __PUNCT__
it would be equal catastroph for your health care __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ differ state have differ rule about what insur compani have to cover __PUNCT__
senat mccain will let compani avoid these rule __PUNCT__
he let them cherri pick the state where thei base __PUNCT__ and sell plan anywher in america __PUNCT__
it the start gun for a race to the bottom __PUNCT__
insur compani will rush to set up shop in state with the fewest protect for patient __PUNCT__ state where thei don't have to cover thing like mammogram __PUNCT__ vaccin and matern care __PUNCT__
now what doe thi mean for folk here in north carolina __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi state requir insur compani to cover mental health care __PUNCT__ cancer screen __PUNCT__ contracept __PUNCT__ treatment for alcohol and more __PUNCT__
and here in north carolina __PUNCT__ you have the right to appeal when your hmo refus to cover the treatment you need __PUNCT__
under john mccain plan __PUNCT__ insur compani wouldn't have to follow ani of these rule __PUNCT__
these ar commonsens protect to make sure that you and your doctor __PUNCT__ not insur compani bureaucrat __PUNCT__ ar make decis about your health __PUNCT__
and john mccain want to let insur compani go around them __PUNCT__
so while senat mccain talk a lot about preserv state __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ when it come down to it __PUNCT__ hi plan is all about protect insur compani __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think it time we start put the health of our famili befor the profit of our insur compani __PUNCT__ and that what i go to do as presid __PUNCT__
i also want to talk a littl about how exactli senat mccain would pai for hi plan __PUNCT__
he been eager to share some detail about that __PUNCT__ but not all __PUNCT__
he tell you that he give you a tax credit of __MONEY__ per person __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__ to help you pai for your insur and health care cost __PUNCT__
but like those ad for prescript drug __PUNCT__ you have to read the fine print to learn the rest of the stori __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ senat mccain would pai for hi plan __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ by tax your health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__
and thi tax would come out of your paycheck __PUNCT__
but the new tax credit he propos __PUNCT__ that wouldn't go to you __PUNCT__
it would go directli to your insur compani __PUNCT__
it an old washington bait and switch __PUNCT__
it a shell game __PUNCT__
senat mccain give you a tax credit with on hand __PUNCT__ but rais your tax with the other __PUNCT__
he hope we won't notic __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i got new for john mccain __PUNCT__ we notic __PUNCT__ we know better __PUNCT__ and we not go to let him get awai with that __PUNCT__
becaus here what happen when senat mccain tax your benefit __PUNCT__ a lot of younger __PUNCT__ healthier worker will opt out of the insur thei get at work __PUNCT__ and go out into the individu market __PUNCT__ where thei can bui a cheaper plan __PUNCT__
that leav employ with older __PUNCT__ sicker worker who ar more expens to cover __PUNCT__ so mani employ will drop their health care plan altogeth __PUNCT__
it the same approach presid bush float a few year ago __PUNCT__
and it could be the begin of the end of our employ __PUNCT__ base health care system __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ studi show that under the mccain plan __PUNCT__ at least __NUM__ million american will lose the insur you reli on from your workplac __PUNCT__
your famili will have to go out into the marketplac with that __MONEY__ tax credit and bui insur on your own __PUNCT__
but what senat mccain doesn't tell you is that the averag cost of a famili health care plan is more than twice that much __PUNCT__ __MONEY__
so where would that leav you __PUNCT__
senat mccain also doesn't tell you that insur in the individu market is more expens and includ fewer benefit __PUNCT__
mani of these plan don't cover thing like prescript drug or pre __PUNCT__ natal care __PUNCT__
and senat mccain health care plan won't do a thing to stop insur compani from discrimin against you if you have a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit like hypertens __PUNCT__ asthma __PUNCT__ diabet or cancer __PUNCT__
employ don't charg you higher premium for these condit __PUNCT__ but insur do __PUNCT__ much higher __PUNCT__
so the sicker you been __PUNCT__ the harder it be to get the care you need __PUNCT__
so here john mccain radic plan in a nutshel __PUNCT__ he tax health care benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ million lose the health care thei have __PUNCT__ million pai more for the health care thei get __PUNCT__ drug and insur compani continu to profit __PUNCT__ and middl class famili watch the system thei reli on begin to unravel befor their ey __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think that the chang we need __PUNCT__
i think we can do better than that __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ my oppon plan reflect the same bankrupt philosophi he subscrib to for three decad in washington __PUNCT__ take care of the healthi and wealthi __PUNCT__ and good luck to everyon els __PUNCT__
thei call thi the ownership societi __PUNCT__ but what it realli mean is __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
your job doesn't give you health care __PUNCT__ the market will fix it __PUNCT__
pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__
insur compani won't pai for your treatment __PUNCT__ too bad __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
thi approach hasn't work these past eight year __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__ and it time for chang __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ i don't think govern can solv all our problem __PUNCT__
but i reject the radic idea that govern ha no role to plai in protect ordinari american __PUNCT__
i reject the think that sai preserv our free market mean let corpor and special interest do as thei pleas __PUNCT__ and everyon els ha to fend for themselv __PUNCT__
i believ that if you work hard and do everyth right __PUNCT__ you shouldn't live in fear of lose everyth becaus of a fluke of genet __PUNCT__ or a bad diagnosi __PUNCT__ or a stroke of bad luck __PUNCT__
that is why __PUNCT__ if i elect presid __PUNCT__ we go to fix our health care system __PUNCT__
we go to take on the drug and insur compani __PUNCT__ reduc cost for famili and busi __PUNCT__ and final provid afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi american __PUNCT__
we start by lower premium by as much as __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__ and we do it by take the follow five step to lower cost throughout our health care system __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we take on the drug compani __PUNCT__ tell them thank but no thank for the overpr drug __PUNCT__ and take step to lower price so peopl can afford them __PUNCT__
and we tell the insur compani __PUNCT__ no more discrimin against peopl with pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
it not right __PUNCT__ and we won't stand for it __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we focu on prevent __PUNCT__
we make sure insur compani cover servic like weight loss program and smoke __PUNCT__ cessat program to help peopl avoid costli __PUNCT__ debilit health problem in the first place __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we reduc wast and ineffici by us the latest technolog to move our health care system into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
thi will save ten of billion a year __PUNCT__ reduc medic error __PUNCT__ and let doctor and nurs spend less time with paperwork and more time with patient __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we reduc the cost of our care by improv the qualiti of our care __PUNCT__
we track which drug and procedur work best and reward provid not just for the quantiti of care thei provid __PUNCT__ but for the qualiti of outcom for their patient __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ we help busi and worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ the feder govern will pai for part of these catastroph case __PUNCT__ which mean lower premium for you __PUNCT__ and less monei out of your pocket __PUNCT__
but cost __PUNCT__ cut isn't enough __PUNCT__
becaus todai __PUNCT__ in the year __NUM__ million american still don't have ani health insur at all __PUNCT__
thi is on of the great moral crise of our time __PUNCT__
it not who we ar __PUNCT__ and it not who we have to be __PUNCT__
that why my plan will cover all american __PUNCT__
and unlik senat mccain __PUNCT__ i do it by build on __PUNCT__ rather than dismantl __PUNCT__ our current __PUNCT__ workplac __PUNCT__ base system __PUNCT__
so if you have insur you like __PUNCT__ you keep that insur __PUNCT__
if you have a doctor you like __PUNCT__ you keep that doctor __PUNCT__
the onli thing that chang for you is that your health care cost will go down __PUNCT__
but if you don't have insur __PUNCT__ or don't like your insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to choos from the same type of qualiti privat plan as everi feder employe __PUNCT__ from a postal worker here in north carolina to a congressman in washington __PUNCT__
no on will be turn awai becaus of a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
if you chang job __PUNCT__ thi insur will go with you __PUNCT__
and if you can't afford thi insur __PUNCT__ you receiv a tax credit to help pai for it __PUNCT__
we also provid substanti help for small busi in the form of tax credit that will cover up to __NUM__ percent of the cost of insur their employe __PUNCT__
thi will help them creat not just new job __PUNCT__ but good job __PUNCT__ job with health care that stai right here in america __PUNCT__
and here how i pai for my plan __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i will aggress cut health care cost by reduc wast __PUNCT__ greed and paperwork __PUNCT__ lower the cost of prescript drug __PUNCT__ and elimin wast subsidi to privat plan in medicar __PUNCT__
that will save a lot __PUNCT__ but will still leav a cost of about __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
i cover that remain cost with a portion of the monei i save by end georg bush tax break for peopl make more than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
thei go back to pai the kind of rate thei paid when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
so we get thi done respons without blow a hole in our deficit __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ none of thi will be easi __PUNCT__
we up against a power __PUNCT__ entrench statu quo in washington that will sai anyth and do anyth and fight with everyth thei got to keep thing the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
but i know that if we come togeth __PUNCT__ and work togeth __PUNCT__ we can do thi __PUNCT__
so mani peopl ar count on us __PUNCT__
a woman name robyn who i met in florida __PUNCT__ is on of those peopl __PUNCT__
back in mai __PUNCT__ her __NUM__ year old son devon __PUNCT__ deh __PUNCT__ vinn __PUNCT__ came to on of our event __PUNCT__ and i got to meet him at the airport in fort lauderdal __PUNCT__
later that dai __PUNCT__ devon becam serious ill __PUNCT__
hi heart start race __PUNCT__ and hi lip turn white __PUNCT__
he wa rush to the hospit and almost went into cardiac arrest __PUNCT__
he wa later diagnos with a heart condit and told he need a procedur that would cost ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
robyn insur compani refus to pai __PUNCT__ thei said it wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__ and robyn famili doesn't have that kind of monei __PUNCT__
but until devon ha that procedur __PUNCT__ he ha to take medic and stop all physic activ __PUNCT__
no more gym class __PUNCT__
no more footbal at school __PUNCT__
no more basketbal at the park with hi friend __PUNCT__
after we met __PUNCT__ robyn sent me an email in which she wrote __PUNCT__ i can't help but feel as if somehow we fail devon __PUNCT__
why couldn't we be the rich famili that ha the great insur or could whip out __NUM__ grand like it is noth __PUNCT__
she end her email with these word __PUNCT__ i ask onli thi of you __PUNCT__ on the dai where you feel so tire you can't think of utter anoth word to the peopl __PUNCT__ think of us __PUNCT__
on the dai when you ar plai basketbal __PUNCT__ think of devon __PUNCT__ who can't __PUNCT__
when those who oppos you have you down __PUNCT__ reach deep and fight back harder __PUNCT__
