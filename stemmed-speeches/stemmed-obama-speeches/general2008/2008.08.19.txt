thank you __PUNCT__ command lisicki __PUNCT__ for your leadership __PUNCT__
let me also acknowledg the leadership of virginia carman __PUNCT__ the presid of the vfw ladi auxiliari __PUNCT__ as well as my friend jim webb who will be speak here later todai __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ let me thank all of the member of the veteran of foreign war of the unit state of america for invit me back to thi convent __PUNCT__
it is a privileg to be among so mani who have given so much for our countri __PUNCT__
i stand befor you todai at a defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__
we ar in the midst of two war __PUNCT__
the terrorist who attack us on 9/11 ar still at larg __PUNCT__
russia ha invad the sovereign nation of georgia __PUNCT__
iran is pursu nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the next command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief is go to have to exercis the best possibl judgment in get us through these difficult time __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ senat mccain came befor you __PUNCT__
he is a man who ha serv thi nation honor __PUNCT__ and he correctli state that on of the chief criteria for the american peopl in thi elect is go to be who can exercis the best judgment as command in chief __PUNCT__
but instead of just offer polici answer __PUNCT__ he turn to a typic laundri list of polit attack __PUNCT__
he said that i have chang my posit on iraq when i have not __PUNCT__
he said that i am for a path of __PUNCT__ retreat and failur __PUNCT__
and he declar __PUNCT__ behind all of these claim and posit by senat obama li the ambit to be presid __PUNCT__ suggest __PUNCT__ as he ha so mani time __PUNCT__ that i put person ambit befor my countri __PUNCT__
that is john mccain prerog __PUNCT__
he can run that kind of campaign __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ that how polit campaign have been run in recent year __PUNCT__
but i believ the american peopl ar better than that __PUNCT__
i believethat thi defin moment demand someth more of us __PUNCT__
if we think that we can secur our countri by just talk tough without act tough and smart __PUNCT__ then we will misunderstand thi moment and miss it opportun __PUNCT__
if we think that we can us the same partisan playbook where we just challeng our oppon patriot to win an elect __PUNCT__ then the american peopl will lose __PUNCT__
the time ar too seriou for thi kind of polit __PUNCT__
the calam left behind by the last eight year is too great __PUNCT__
so let me begin by offer my judgment about what we done __PUNCT__ where we ar __PUNCT__ and where we need to go __PUNCT__
six year ago __PUNCT__ i stood up at a time when it wa polit difficult to oppos go to war in iraq __PUNCT__ and argu that our first prioriti had to be finish the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan __PUNCT__
senat mccain wa alreadi turn hi sight to iraq just dai after 9/11 __PUNCT__ and he becam a lead support of an invas and occup of a countri that had absolut noth to do with the 9/11attack __PUNCT__ and that __PUNCT__ as despic as saddam hussein wa __PUNCT__ pose no immin threat to the american peopl __PUNCT__
two of the biggest beneficiari of that decis were al qaeda leadership __PUNCT__ which no longer face the pressur of america focus attent __PUNCT__ and iran __PUNCT__ which ha advanc it nuclear program __PUNCT__ continu it support for terror __PUNCT__ and increas it influenc in iraq and the region __PUNCT__
in the run __PUNCT__ up to the invas of iraq __PUNCT__ i warn that war would fan the flame of extrem in the middl east __PUNCT__ creat new center of terrorism,and tie us down in a costli and open __PUNCT__ end occup __PUNCT__
senat mccain predict that we be greet as liber __PUNCT__ and that the iraqi would bear the cost of rebuild through their bounti oil revenu __PUNCT__
for the good of our countri __PUNCT__ i wish he had been right __PUNCT__ and i had been __URL__ that not what histori show __PUNCT__
senat mccain now argu that despit these costli strateg errors,hi judgment ha been vindic due to the result of the surg __PUNCT__
let me onc again prais gener petraeu and ambassador crocker __PUNCT__ thei ar outstand american __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ gain have been made in lower the level of violenc thank to the outstand effort of our militari __PUNCT__ theincreas capabl of iraq secur forc __PUNCT__ the ceasefir of shiit militia __PUNCT__ and the decis taken by sunni tribe to take the fight to al qaeda __PUNCT__
those ar the fact __PUNCT__ and all american welcom them __PUNCT__
but understand what the essenti argument wa about __PUNCT__
befor the surge,i argu that the long __PUNCT__ term solut in iraq is polit __PUNCT__ the iraqi govern must reconcil it differ and take respons forit futur __PUNCT__
that hold true todai __PUNCT__
we have lost over a thousand american live and spent hundr of billion of dollar sinc the surg began,but iraq leader still haven't made hard compromis or substanti invest in rebuild their countri __PUNCT__
our militari is badli overstretch __PUNCT__ a fact that ha sure been note in capit around the world __PUNCT__
and while we pai a heavi price in iraq __PUNCT__ and american pai record price at the pump __PUNCT__ iraq govern is sit on a __MONEY__ billiondollar budget surplu from windfal oil profit __PUNCT__
let be clear __PUNCT__ our troop have complet everi mission thei been given __PUNCT__
thei have creat the space for polit reconcili __PUNCT__
now it must be fill by an iraqi govern that reconcil it differ and spend it oil profit to meet the need of it peopl __PUNCT__
iraqi inact threaten the progress we made and creat an open for iran and the __PUNCT__ special group __PUNCT__ it support __PUNCT__
it time to press the iraq isto take respons for their futur __PUNCT__
the best wai to do that is a respons redeploy of our combat brigad __PUNCT__ carri out in close consult with command on the ground __PUNCT__
we can safe redeploi at apac that remov our combat brigad in __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
that would be well into __NUM__ __PUNCT__ seven year after the war began __PUNCT__
after thi redeployment,w keep a residu forc to target remnant of al qaeda __PUNCT__ to protect our servic member and diplomat __PUNCT__ and to train iraq secur forc if the iraqi make polit progress __PUNCT__
iraq democrat __PUNCT__ elect prime minist ha embrac thi time frame __PUNCT__
now it time to succe in iraq by turn iraq over to it sovereign govern __PUNCT__
we should not keep send our troop to fight tour after tour of duti while our militari is overstretch __PUNCT__
we should not keep spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq while american struggl in a sluggish economi __PUNCT__
end the war will allow us to invest in america __PUNCT__ to strengthen our militari __PUNCT__ and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan __PUNCT__
thi is the central front in the war on terror __PUNCT__
thi is where the taliban is gain strength and launch new attack __PUNCT__ includ on that just took the life of ten french soldier __PUNCT__
thi is where osama bin laden and the same terrorist who kill nearli __NUM__ american on our own soil ar hide and plot seven year after 9/11 __PUNCT__
thi is a war that we have to win __PUNCT__
and as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ i will have no greater prioriti than take out these terrorist who threaten america __PUNCT__ and finish the job against the taliban __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ i have call for more resourc and more troop to finish the fight in afghanistan __PUNCT__
with hi overwhelm focu on iraq __PUNCT__ senat mccain argu that we could just __PUNCT__ muddl through __PUNCT__ in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and onli came around to support my call for more troop last month __PUNCT__
now,w need a polici of __PUNCT__ more for more __PUNCT__ more from america and our nato alli __PUNCT__ and more from the afghan govern __PUNCT__
that why i call for at least two addit u. __PUNCT__ combat brigad and an addit __MONEY__ in non __PUNCT__ militari assist for afghanistan __PUNCT__ with a demand for more action from the afghan govern to take on corrupt and counter narcot __PUNCT__ and to improv the live of the afghan peopl __PUNCT__
we must also recogn that we cannot succe in afghanistan or secur america as long as there is a terrorist safe __PUNCT__ haven in north west pakistan __PUNCT__
a year ago __PUNCT__ i said that we must take action against bin laden and hi lieuten if we have them in our sight and pakistan cannot or will not act __PUNCT__
senat mccain critic me and claim that i wa for __PUNCT__ bomb our alli __PUNCT__
so for all of hi talk about follow osama bin laden to the gate of hell __PUNCT__ senat mccain refus to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he spent year back a dictat in pakistan who fail to serv the interest of hi own peopl __PUNCT__
i argu for year that we need to move from a __PUNCT__ musharraf polici __PUNCT__ to a __PUNCT__ pakistan polici __PUNCT__
we must move beyond an allianc built on mere conveni or a relationship with on man __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ with presid musharraf resign __PUNCT__ we have the opportun to do just that __PUNCT__
that why i cosponsor a bill to tripl non __PUNCT__ militari aid to the pakistani peopl __PUNCT__ while ensur that the militari assist we do provid is us to take the fight to the taliban and al qaeda in the tribal region of pakistan __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ our attent is also on the republ of georgia __PUNCT__ and senat mccain and i both strongli support the peopl of georgia and the american deliv humanitarian aid __PUNCT__
there is no possibl justif for russia action __PUNCT__
russian troop have yet to begin the withdraw requir by the ceas __PUNCT__ fire sign by their presid __PUNCT__ and we ar hear report of russian atroc __PUNCT__ burn wheat field __PUNCT__ brutal kill __PUNCT__ and the destruct of georgia infrastructur and militari asset __PUNCT__
thi crisi underscor the need for engag u. __PUNCT__ leadership in the world __PUNCT__
we fail to head off thi conflict and lost leverag in our abil to contain it becaus our leader have been distract __PUNCT__ our resourc overstretch __PUNCT__ and our allianc frai __PUNCT__
american leadership mean get engag earlier to shape event so that we not mere respond to them __PUNCT__
that why i commit to renew our leadership and rebuild our allianc as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
for month __PUNCT__ i have call for activ intern engag to resolv the disput over south ossetia and abkhazia __PUNCT__
i made it crystal clear befor __PUNCT__ at the begin of __PUNCT__ and dure thi conflict that georgia territori integr must be respect __PUNCT__ and that georgia should be integr into transatlant institut __PUNCT__
i have condemn russian aggress __PUNCT__ and todai i reiter my demand that russia abid by the ceas __PUNCT__ fire __PUNCT__
russia must know that it action will have __URL__ will imperil the civil nuclear agreement __PUNCT__ and russia stand in the intern commun __PUNCT__ includ the nato __PUNCT__ russia council __PUNCT__ and russia desir to particip in organ like the wto and the oecd __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we must help georgia rebuild what ha been __URL__ is why i proud to join my friend __PUNCT__ senat joe biden __PUNCT__ in call for an addit __MONEY__ billion in reconstruct assist for the peopl of georgia __PUNCT__
these ar the judgment i made and the polici that we have to debat __PUNCT__ becaus we do have differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
but on of the thing that we have to chang in thi countri is the idea that peopl can't disagre without challeng each other charact and patriot __PUNCT__
i have never suggest that senat mccain pick hi posit on nation secur base on polit or person ambit __PUNCT__
i have not suggest it becaus i believ that he genuin want to serv america nation interest __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it time for him to acknowledg thati want to do the same __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ i will let no on question my love of thi countri __PUNCT__
ilov america __PUNCT__ so do you __PUNCT__ and so doe john mccain __PUNCT__
when i look out at thi audienc __PUNCT__ i see peopl of differ polit view __PUNCT__
you ar democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__
but you all serv together,and fought togeth __PUNCT__ and bled togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
you did not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ you serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so let have a seriou debat __PUNCT__ and let debat our disagr on the merit of polici __PUNCT__ not person attack __PUNCT__
and no matter how heat itget or what kind of campaign he choos to run __PUNCT__ i will honor senat mccain servic __PUNCT__ just like i honor the servic of everi veteran in thi room __PUNCT__ and everi american who ha worn the uniform of the unit state __PUNCT__
on of those american wa my grandfath __PUNCT__ stanlei dunham __PUNCT__
my father left when i wa __NUM__ so my grandfath wa the man who help rais me __PUNCT__
he grew up in el dorado __PUNCT__ kansa __PUNCT__ a town too small to warrant boldfac on a road map __PUNCT__
he work on oil rig and drift from town to town dure the depress __PUNCT__
then he met my grandmoth and enlist after pearl harbor __PUNCT__
he would go on to march across europ in patton armi __PUNCT__ while my great uncl fought with the __NUM__ infantri divis to liber buchenwald __PUNCT__ my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line,and my mother wa born at fort leavenworth __PUNCT__
after my grandfath left the armi __PUNCT__ he went to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ bought hi home with help from the feder hous author __PUNCT__ and he and my grandmoth move west in a restless pursuit of their dream __PUNCT__
thei were among the men and women of our greatest gener __PUNCT__
thei came from ordinari place __PUNCT__ and went on to do extraordinari thing __PUNCT__
thei surviv a depress and face down fascism __PUNCT__
and when the gun fell silent __PUNCT__ america stood by them __PUNCT__ becaus thei had a govern that didn't just ask them to win a war __PUNCT__ it help them to live their dream in peac __PUNCT__ and to becom the backbon of the largest middl class that the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
in the five year after world war ii __PUNCT__ the gi bill help __NUM__ million veteran get an educ __PUNCT__
two million went to colleg __PUNCT__
million more learn a trade in factori or on farm __PUNCT__
four million veteran receiv help in bui a home __PUNCT__ lead to the biggest home construct boom in our histori __PUNCT__
and these veteran didn't just receiv a hand from washington __PUNCT__ thei did their part to lift up america __PUNCT__ just as thei done their duti in defend it __PUNCT__
thei becam teacher and doctor __PUNCT__ cop and firefight who were the foundat of our commun __PUNCT__
thei becam the innov and small busi owner who help drive the american economi __PUNCT__
thei becam the scientist and engin who help us win the space race against the soviet __PUNCT__
thei won a cold war __PUNCT__ and left a legaci to their children and grandchildren who reach new horizon of opportun __PUNCT__
i am a part of that legaci __PUNCT__
without it __PUNCT__ i would not be stand on thi stage todai __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i will do everyth that i can to keep the promis __PUNCT__ to advanc the american dream for all our veteran __PUNCT__ and to enlist them in the caus of build a stronger america __PUNCT__
our young men and women in uniform have proven that thei ar the equal of the greatest gener on the battlefield __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we must ensur that our brave troop serv abroad todai becom the backbon of our middl class at home tomorrow __PUNCT__
those who fight to defend america abroad must have the chanc to live their dream at home __PUNCT__ through educ and their abil to make a good live __PUNCT__ through afford health care __PUNCT__ and through a retir that is dignifi and secur __PUNCT__
that is the promis that we must keep with all who serv __PUNCT__
it start with those who choos to remain in uniform __PUNCT__ as well as their famili __PUNCT__
my wife michel ha net with militari famili in north carolina __PUNCT__ kentucki and virginia over the last sever month __PUNCT__
everi time __PUNCT__ she pass on their stori __PUNCT__ stori of live fill with patriot and purpos __PUNCT__ but also stori of spous struggl to pai the bill __PUNCT__ kid deal with an absent parent __PUNCT__ and the uniqu burden of multipl deploy __PUNCT__
the messag that michel ha heard is what you all know and have live __PUNCT__ when a love on is deploi __PUNCT__ the whole famili goe to war __PUNCT__
the vfw ha done an extraordinari job of stand by our militari famili __PUNCT__ help out with everyth from a phone card for a soldier who is oversea __PUNCT__ to an extra hand around the hous __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will stand with you __PUNCT__
we need a militari famili advisori board to identifi new wai to eas the burden __PUNCT__
we need more offici support for the volunt network that help militari spous get by __PUNCT__
and we need to make sure that militari pai doe not lag behind the privat sector __PUNCT__ so that those who serv can rais their famili and live the life thei earn __PUNCT__
for those who return to civilian life __PUNCT__ i will support their american dream in thi __NUM__ centuri just as we support gener of veteran in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that start with educ __PUNCT__
everyon who serv thi countri should have the same opportun that my grandfath had under the gi bill __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i wa a strong and earli support of jim webb gi bill for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a bill that senat mccain call too gener __PUNCT__
at a time when the skyrocket cost of tuition is price thousand of american out of a colleg education,thi bill provid everi veteran with a real chanc to afford a world __PUNCT__ class colleg educ __PUNCT__
and that what i continu to stand upfor as presid __PUNCT__
we must also stand up for afford health care for everi singl veteran __PUNCT__
that why i pledg to build a __NUM__ centuri va __PUNCT__
we need to cut through the red tape __PUNCT__ everi servic __PUNCT__ member should get electron copi of medic and servic record upon discharg __PUNCT__
we need to close shortfal __PUNCT__ it time to fulli fund va health care __PUNCT__ and to add more vetcent __PUNCT__
we need to get rid of mean __PUNCT__ test __PUNCT__ everi veteran should be allow into the va system __PUNCT__
my oppon take a differ view __PUNCT__
he want to ration care so the va onli serv combat injuri __PUNCT__ while everyon els get an insur card __PUNCT__
while the va need some real reform to better serv those who have worn the uniform __PUNCT__ privat is just not the answer __PUNCT__
we cannot risk our veteran __PUNCT__ health care by turn the va into just anoth health insur __PUNCT__
we need to make sure the va is strong enough to treat everi veteran who depend on it __PUNCT__
that what i do as presid __PUNCT__
and we must expand and enhanc our abil to identifi and treat ptsd and traumat brain injuri at all level __PUNCT__ from enlist __PUNCT__ to deploy __PUNCT__ to civilian life __PUNCT__
no on should suffer in silenc __PUNCT__ or slip through the crack in the system __PUNCT__
that why i pass measur to increas screen for these unseen wound __PUNCT__ and help lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practic of kick out troop who suffer from them __PUNCT__
thi is someth i fought for in the senat __PUNCT__ and it someth that i make a prioriti as presid __PUNCT__
econom secur for our veteran also depend on revamp an over burden benefit system __PUNCT__
i congratul the vfw for what you done to help veteran navig a broken vba bureaucraci __PUNCT__
now it time for the govern to do a better job __PUNCT__
we need more worker __PUNCT__ and a 21stcenturi electron system that is fulli link up to militari record and the va health network __PUNCT__
it time to ensur that those who serv get the benefit that thei earn __PUNCT__
just as we give veteran the support thei deserv __PUNCT__ we must also engag them and all american in a new caus __PUNCT__ renew america __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i believ that there is no challeng too great for the american peopl to meet if thei ar call upon to come togeth __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ each of us is free to seek our dream __PUNCT__ but we must also serv a common purpos __PUNCT__ a higher purpos __PUNCT__
no on embodi that commit like a veteran __PUNCT__
just think of the skill that our troop have develop through their servic __PUNCT__
thei have not simpli wage war in afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__ thei have rebuilt infrastructur __PUNCT__ support new agricultur __PUNCT__ train polic forc __PUNCT__ and develop health care system __PUNCT__
for those leav militari servic __PUNCT__ it time to appli those skill to our great nation challeng here at home __PUNCT__
that mean expand program like troop __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ teacher that put veteran sat the front of the classroom __PUNCT__
that mean tap the talent of engin who serv as we make a substanti invest to rebuild our infrastructur and creat million of new job __PUNCT__
that mean dramat expand nation servic program to give american of all ag __PUNCT__ skill and station the chanc to give back to their commun and their countri __PUNCT__
i also enlist veteran in forg anew american energi economi __PUNCT__
that why i propos a green veteran initi to give our veteran the train thei need to succe in the green job of the futur __PUNCT__ so that thei put themselv on a pathwai to a success career __PUNCT__ while ensur that our nation secur is never held hostag to hostil nation __PUNCT__
thi is how we can help our veteran live their dream while help our countri meet the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and thi is what we have learn from so mani gener of veteran __PUNCT__ includ those of you here todai __PUNCT__ that your contribut to the american stori doe not end when the uniform come off __PUNCT__
we need those who serv in our militari to live their dream __PUNCT__ and to continu serv the caus of america __PUNCT__ when the gun fall silent __PUNCT__
that what the vfw stand for __PUNCT__ and if i have the honor of be your presid __PUNCT__ that what my administr will work for everi singl dai __PUNCT__
becaus i believ that we have a sacr trust with those who serv in our militari __PUNCT__
that trust is simpl __PUNCT__ america will be there for you just as you have been there for america __PUNCT__
it a trust that begin at enlist __PUNCT__ and it never end __PUNCT__
i thought of that trust last week when i visit the pearl harbor memori __PUNCT__
i saw where the bomb fell on the uss arizona __PUNCT__ and where a war began that would reshap the world order while reshap the live of all who serv in it __PUNCT__ from our great gener and admir __PUNCT__ to the enlist men like my grandfath __PUNCT__
then i visit hi grave at the punchbowl __PUNCT__ the nation memori cemeteri of the pacif __PUNCT__
i still rememb the dai that we laid my grandfath to rest __PUNCT__
in a cemeteri line with the grave of american who have sacrif for our countri __PUNCT__ we heard the solemn note of tap and the crack of gun fire in salut __PUNCT__ we watch as a fold flag wa hand to my grandmoth and my grandfath wa laid to rest __PUNCT__
it wa a nation final act of servic and gratitud to stanlei dunham __PUNCT__ an america that stood by my grandfath when he took off the uniform __PUNCT__ and never left hi side __PUNCT__
thi is what we ow our troop and our veteran __PUNCT__
becaus in everi note of tap and in everi fold flag __PUNCT__ we hear and see an unwav belief in the idea of america __PUNCT__
the idea that no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ or what you look like __PUNCT__ or who your parent ar __PUNCT__ thi is a place where anyth is possibl __PUNCT__ where anyon can make it __PUNCT__ where we look out for each other __PUNCT__ and take care of each other __PUNCT__ where we rise and fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
it an idea that worth fight for __PUNCT__ an idea for which so mani american have given that last full measur of devot __PUNCT__
now it fall to us to advanc that idea just as so mani gener have befor __PUNCT__
