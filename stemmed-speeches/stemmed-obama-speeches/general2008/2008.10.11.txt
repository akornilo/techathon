we can restor confid in our economi and renew that fundament belief __PUNCT__ that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
america is home to colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__ and some of the biggest idea and innov in histori have come from our small busi __PUNCT__
we got the hardest worker on earth __PUNCT__ folk who work two job or three job and take that last bu home at night becaus thei want someth more for their children __PUNCT__
and no on work harder than folk here in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ just ask my friend __PUNCT__ joe biden __PUNCT__ he tell you __PUNCT__
so while it won't be easi __PUNCT__ there is no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ my oppon still see thing differ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i want to acknowledg that senat mccain tri to tone down the rhetor yesterdai __PUNCT__ and i appreci hi remind that we can disagre while still be respect of each other __PUNCT__
i said it befor __PUNCT__ and i sai it again __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha serv thi countri with honor __PUNCT__ and he deserv our thank for that __PUNCT__
but when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ and what famili here in pennsylvania ar go through __PUNCT__ senat mccain still doesn't get it __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ senat mccain campaign manag actual said that senat mccain wasn't talk about the market becaus there just not much a candid for presid can sai __PUNCT__ and thei aren't sure what he sai each dai even if he did talk about it __PUNCT__

we simpli cannot afford four more year of the econom theori that sai we should give more to those with the most and hope prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just corpor ceo __PUNCT__ but their secretari too __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
