the event of the last few week have shown us that the stake in thi elect could not be higher __PUNCT__
we ar in a financi crisi as seriou as ani we face sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
in recent week __PUNCT__ we seen our financi landscap shift befor our ey __PUNCT__
we seen a grow credit crunch put new pressur on bank __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and famili __PUNCT__
and on mondai __PUNCT__ we saw the singl largest declin of the stock market in two decad __PUNCT__ a declin that threaten not just the wealth of wall street execut __PUNCT__ but the life save __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ and econom secur of million of ordinari american __PUNCT__
everywher you look __PUNCT__ the econom new is troubl __PUNCT__
but for so mani of you here in michigan __PUNCT__ it isn't realli new at all __PUNCT__
__NUM__ job have been lost sinc the year began __PUNCT__ includ about __NUM__ in michigan __PUNCT__
the unemploy rate here in grand rapid and other part of thi state is nearli doubl what it is across thi countri __PUNCT__
and a new job report is come out tomorrow that expert predict will show our ninth straight month of job loss __PUNCT__
nine straight month of job loss __PUNCT__ yet __PUNCT__ just the other week __PUNCT__ john mccain said the __PUNCT__ fundament of the economi ar strong __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't know what yardstick senat mccain us __PUNCT__ but where i come from __PUNCT__ there noth more fundament than a job __PUNCT__
and when we lose job month after month after month __PUNCT__ when good __PUNCT__ hard __PUNCT__ work american who done everyth right watch their dream slip awai __PUNCT__ the fundament of our economi ar not strong __PUNCT__ and it time we had a presid who understand that __PUNCT__
but it not just job __PUNCT__
home valu ar fall __PUNCT__
wage ar flat __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__
and the cost of everyth from ga to groceri is go up and up __PUNCT__
these ar the quiet storm that our famili have been face for month if not year __PUNCT__ and these ar the storm that will onli grow wors if we do not act __PUNCT__ and act now __PUNCT__ to pass the rescu plan that befor congress __PUNCT__
democrat and republican in the hous need to do what the senat did last night and do what right for thi countri __PUNCT__
if the financi market collaps __PUNCT__ and loan ar not avail __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ larg and small __PUNCT__ will follow __PUNCT__
it your job __PUNCT__ your save __PUNCT__ your abil to pursu your dream for your children that ar at risk __PUNCT__
that why we have to act __PUNCT__
that why we have to set asid the polit of the moment and exercis someth we haven't seen in washington late __PUNCT__ respons __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me be perfectli clear __PUNCT__
the fact that we ar in thi mess is an outrag __PUNCT__
it an outrag becaus we did not get here by accid __PUNCT__
thi wa not a normal part of the busi cycl __PUNCT__
thi did not happen becaus of a few bad appl __PUNCT__
thi financi crisi is a direct result of the greed and irrespons that ha domin washington and wall street for year __PUNCT__
it the result of specul who game the system __PUNCT__ regul who look the other wai __PUNCT__ and lobbyist who bought their wai into our govern __PUNCT__
it the result of an econom philosophi that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__ a philosophi that view even the most common __PUNCT__ sens regul as unwis and unnecessari __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thi crisi is noth less than a final verdict on thi fail philosophi __PUNCT__ and it a philosophi i run for presid to end __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
becaus despit my oppon best effort to make you think otherwis __PUNCT__ thi is the philosophi he embrac dure hi twenti __PUNCT__ six year in washington __PUNCT__
over the past few dai __PUNCT__ he talk a lot about get tough on wall street __PUNCT__ but over the past few decad __PUNCT__ he fought against the veri rule of the road that could stop thi mess __PUNCT__
he sai he take on corpor lobbyist now __PUNCT__ but he put seven of the biggest lobbyist in washington in charg of hi campaign __PUNCT__
and if you think those lobbyist ar work dai and night to elect him just to put themselv out of busi __PUNCT__ well i got a bridg to sell you up in alaska __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ my oppon philosophi isn't just wrong __PUNCT__ head __PUNCT__ it reveal how out of touch he realli is __PUNCT__
how els could he offer __MONEY__ billion in tax cut for big corpor at a time like thi __PUNCT__ how els could he propos give the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo a __MONEY__ tax cut at a time when million of american ar struggl to pai their bill __PUNCT__ how els could he come up with an econom plan that leav out more than __NUM__ million middl class famili at the veri moment thei need help most __PUNCT__
senat mccain just doesn't get it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ michigan __PUNCT__ you and i do get it __PUNCT__
that why we here todai __PUNCT__
we know the next four year don't have to look like the last eight __PUNCT__
we know we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus that who we ar __PUNCT__
becaus thi is america __PUNCT__
we a nation that face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we risen to meet these challeng becaus we never forgotten that fundament truth __PUNCT__ that here __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ it written by us __PUNCT__
it time to take our destini into our own hand and reclaim our econom futur __PUNCT__
part of what that mean is pass the rescu plan that befor congress __PUNCT__
i know mani peopl were outrag when thi administr initi ask the american peopl to sign a blank check to solv thi crisi __PUNCT__
i wa outrag too __PUNCT__
that why i fought to make sure the rescu plan protect taxpay __PUNCT__ provid oversight and account __PUNCT__ help struggl homeown stai in their home __PUNCT__ and doesn't reward the wall street execut whose greed and irrespons led us to thi peril moment __PUNCT__
while these taxpay protect ar now part of the rescu plan __PUNCT__ thi plan still isn't perfect __PUNCT__
but it what we must do to prevent a crisi from turn into a catastroph __PUNCT__
but understand __PUNCT__ even with thi plan __PUNCT__ we mai face a long and difficult road to recoveri __PUNCT__
that is why __PUNCT__ if i presid __PUNCT__ pass thi rescu plan won't be the end of what we do to strengthen our economi __PUNCT__ it be the begin __PUNCT__
it be the begin of a long __PUNCT__ term rescu plan for our middl class __PUNCT__ a plan that will creat million of new job __PUNCT__ help famili keep up with rise cost __PUNCT__ reliev the burden of crush health care cost __PUNCT__ and educ the next gener of american with the skill and knowledg to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ peopl have ask whether the size of the plan that congress is vote on __PUNCT__ togeth with the weaken economi __PUNCT__ mean that the next presid will have to scale back hi agenda and some of hi propos __PUNCT__
and there no doubt that some program or polici that i propos on the campaign trail mai requir more time to achiev __PUNCT__
but i reject the idea that you can't build a strong middl class at a time when our economi is weak __PUNCT__
i believ that build a strong middl class is the kei to make our economi strong __PUNCT__
and that what we do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
to creat new job __PUNCT__ we not onli invest in rebuild our crumbl road and bridg __PUNCT__ and our outdat electr grid __PUNCT__ we strengthen the auto industri that built the middl class in thi countri __PUNCT__
a number of auto compani ar show real leadership in build fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ and i applaud them for it __PUNCT__
but i refus to accept that washington ha to stand idli by while foreign automak outpac us __PUNCT__
i run for presid to make sure the car of the futur ar made in the same place thei alwai been made __PUNCT__ right here in michigan __PUNCT__
i be a presid who final keep the promis that made year after year by provid the fund our automak need to retool their factori and make fuel __PUNCT__ effici and altern fuel car and truck __PUNCT__
and as we fight to revers the declin in manufactur over the last eight year __PUNCT__ we also bring manufactur into the __NUM__ centuri by build an american green energi sector __PUNCT__
we invest __MONEY__ billion over the next decad in afford __PUNCT__ renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__ wind power and solar power and the next gener of biofuel __PUNCT__ an invest that will lead to new industri and five million new job that pai well and can't ever be outsourc __PUNCT__
becaus the fight for american manufactur is the fight for america futur __PUNCT__ and i believ that a fight thi countri will win __PUNCT__
i will also reform our tax code so that it doesn't reward the lobbyist who wrote it __PUNCT__ but the american worker and small busi who deserv it __PUNCT__
i will elimin capit gain tax for small busi and start __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that we can grow our economi and creat the high __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
i will cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all work famili __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you will not see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i offer three time the tax relief for middl __PUNCT__ class famili as senat mccain doe __PUNCT__ becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
i will reform our health care system so we can reliev famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and our economi from the crush cost of health care by invest in new technolog and prevent care __PUNCT__
if you have health care __PUNCT__ my plan will lower your premium __PUNCT__
if you don't __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and we reduc cost for busi and their worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill and condit __PUNCT__ becaus that how we make our compani more competit in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will meet our moral oblig to provid everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ becaus it will take noth less to compet in the global economi __PUNCT__
i invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
i recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them higher salari and give them more support __PUNCT__
but in exchang __PUNCT__ i will ask for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and we will keep our promis to everi young american __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i will modern our outdat financi regul and put in place the common __PUNCT__ sens rule of the road i been call for sinc march __PUNCT__ rule that will keep our market free __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and honest __PUNCT__ rule that will restor account and respons in the boardroom __PUNCT__ and make sure wall street can never get awai with the stunt that caus thi crisi again __PUNCT__
but just as we demand account on wall street __PUNCT__ we must also demand it in washington __PUNCT__
becaus we cannot afford anoth four year of the kind of deficit we seen dure the past eight __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to mortgag our children futur on anoth mountain of debt __PUNCT__
that why i not go to stand here and simpli tell you what i go to spend __PUNCT__ i go to tell you how we go to save when i am presid __PUNCT__
i will go through the entir feder budget __PUNCT__ page by page __PUNCT__ line by line __PUNCT__ and elimin program that don't work and aren't need __PUNCT__
we start by end a war in iraq that cost __MONEY__ billion a month while the iraqi govern sit on a __MONEY__ billion surplu __PUNCT__
and we save billion of dollar by shut the oversea tax haven that let compani avoid pai tax here in america __PUNCT__
and as for those program we do need __PUNCT__ i make them work better and cost less __PUNCT__
we save billion by cut wast __PUNCT__ improv manag __PUNCT__ and strengthen oversight __PUNCT__
and i will final end the abus of no __PUNCT__ bid contract onc and for all __PUNCT__ the dai of sweetheart deal for halliburton will be over when i in the white hous __PUNCT__
these ar the chang and reform that we need __PUNCT__
a new era of respons and account on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
common __PUNCT__ sens regul to prevent a crisi like thi from ever happen again __PUNCT__
invest in the technolog and innov that will restor prosper and lead to new job and a new economi for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
bottom __PUNCT__ up growth that will creat opportun for everi american __PUNCT__
i won't pretend thi will be easi or come without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
what thi crisi ha taught us is that at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ there is no real separ between main street and wall street __PUNCT__
there is onli the road we travel on as american __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall on that journei as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow our own petti differ and broken polit to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ to believ in yourselv __PUNCT__ in each other __PUNCT__ and in the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__
becaus togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when we have a crisi to solv and an economi to save __PUNCT__
not when there ar so mani american without job and without home __PUNCT__
not when there ar famili who can't afford to see a doctor __PUNCT__ or send their child to colleg __PUNCT__ or pai their bill at the end of the month __PUNCT__
not when there is a gener that is count on us to give them the same opportun and the same chanc that we had for ourselv __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
american have done thi befor __PUNCT__
some of us had grandpar or parent who said mayb i can't go to colleg but my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but my child can __PUNCT__
i mai have to rent __PUNCT__ but mayb my children will have a home thei can call their own __PUNCT__
i mai not have a lot of monei but mayb my child will run for senat __PUNCT__
i might live in a small villag but mayb somedai my son can be presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now it fall to us __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
and i need you to make it happen __PUNCT__
if you want the next four year look just like the last eight __PUNCT__ then i am not your candid __PUNCT__
but if you want real chang __PUNCT__ if you want an economi that reward work __PUNCT__ and that work for main street and wall street __PUNCT__ if you want tax relief for the middl class and million of new job __PUNCT__ if you want health care you can afford and educ that help your kid compet __PUNCT__ then i ask you to knock on some door __PUNCT__ make some call __PUNCT__ talk to your neighbor __PUNCT__ and give me your vote on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and if you do __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ we will win michigan __PUNCT__ we will win thi elect __PUNCT__ and then you and i __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ will chang thi countri and chang thi world __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ god bless you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless america __PUNCT__
