the era of greed and irrespons on wall street and in washington ha led us to a financi crisi as seriou as ani we have face sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
thei said thei want to let the market run free but thei let it run wild __PUNCT__ and thei trampl our american valu of fair __PUNCT__ balanc __PUNCT__ and respons to on anoth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ becaus of specul who game the system and regul who look the other wai __PUNCT__ your job __PUNCT__ your life save __PUNCT__ and the stabil of our entir economi ar at risk __PUNCT__
we have been left with no good option __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ democrat and republican in washington have agre on an emerg rescu plan that is our best and onli wai to prevent an econom catastroph __PUNCT__
it a plan that improv a good deal over the last week __PUNCT__
thi administr start off by ask for a blank check to solv thi problem __PUNCT__
i said absolut not __PUNCT__
i said it wa unaccept to expect the american peopl to hand thi administr or ani administr a __MONEY__ billion check with no condit and no oversight when a lack of oversight in washington and on wall street is exactli what got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
if the american peopl ar be ask to help solv thi crisi __PUNCT__ then you have a right to make sure that your tax dollar ar protect __PUNCT__
and so i laid out a few a condit for washington __PUNCT__
i said we need an independ board to provid oversight and account for how and where thi monei is spent at everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
i said that if american taxpay ar financ thi solut __PUNCT__ then you should be treat like investor __PUNCT__ you should get everi penni of your tax dollar back onc thi economi recov __PUNCT__ and wall street should foot the bill __PUNCT__
i said that we cannot and will not simpli bailout wall street without help the million of innoc homeown who ar struggl to stai in their home __PUNCT__
thei deserv a plan too __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i said that i would not allow thi plan to becom a welfar program for the wall street execut whose greed and irrespons got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
thank to the hard work of democrat and republican __PUNCT__ the propos we have todai includ these taxpay protect __PUNCT__
and if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will review the entir plan on the dai i take offic to make sure that it is work to save our economi and that you get your monei back __PUNCT__
but let me be absolut clear about on thing __PUNCT__
at a time like thi __PUNCT__ a time when __NUM__ worker have lost their job sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__ when home valu ar fall and paycheck ar flat __PUNCT__ when it never been harder to save or retir __PUNCT__ to bui ga or groceri __PUNCT__ at a time when american ar work so much harder for so much less __PUNCT__ the fact that you ar be call upon to help clean up wall street mess is an outrag __PUNCT__
it is an outrag that we spend thi monei when we could be invest in afford health care __PUNCT__ or renew energi __PUNCT__ or better school for our children __PUNCT__
it is an outrag that we ar in thi mess and we ar here to make sure that it never happen again __PUNCT__
we did not arriv at thi moment by some accid of histori __PUNCT__
thi wa not a normal part of the busi cycl __PUNCT__
thi wa not just a few bad appl on wall street __PUNCT__
thi crisi is a direct result of a philosophi that the folk run washington have been follow for decad __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__ a philosophi that sai even common __PUNCT__ sens regul ar unnecessari and unwis __PUNCT__ a philosophi that let lobbyist shred consum protect and put the need of special interest ahead of work peopl __PUNCT__
and what we have seen over the last few week is the final verdict on thi fail philosophi __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page __PUNCT__
that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
becaus senat mccain ha follow thi philosophi for twenti __PUNCT__ six year in washington and now he run to give us anoth four __PUNCT__
he fought against common __PUNCT__ sens regul for decad __PUNCT__ he call for less regul twenti time just thi year __PUNCT__ and he said in a recent interview that he thought de __PUNCT__ regul ha actual help grow our economi __PUNCT__
senat __PUNCT__ what economi ar you talk about __PUNCT__
at a time when we put hundr of billion of taxpay dollar on the line __PUNCT__ senat mccain still want to spend __MONEY__ billion on tax break for the biggest corpor in america __PUNCT__
he want to give a __MONEY__ tax break to the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__ but not on dime of relief to more than __NUM__ million middl __PUNCT__ class american __PUNCT__
he like to talk about how he take on the corpor lobbyist in washington __PUNCT__ but he put seven of them in charg of hi campaign __PUNCT__
and if you think those lobbyist ar work dai and night to elect my oppon just to put themselv out of busi __PUNCT__ well i got a bridg to sell you up in alaska __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ senat mccain just doesn't get it __PUNCT__ he doesn't get that thi crisi on wall street hit main street a long time ago __PUNCT__
that why hi first respons to the greatest fiscal meltdown in gener wa to sai that the __PUNCT__ fundament of the economi ar strong __PUNCT__ and why he didn't sai the word __PUNCT__ middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ onc in an entir __NUM__ __PUNCT__ minut debat __PUNCT__
i read the other dai that senat mccain like to gambl __PUNCT__
he like to roll those dice __PUNCT__
and that ok __PUNCT__
i enjoi a littl friendli game of poker myself everi now and then __PUNCT__
but on thing i know is thi __PUNCT__ we can't afford to gambl on four more year of the same disastr econom polici we had for the last eight __PUNCT__
i know that when senat mccain sai he want to bring the same kind of deregul to our health care system that he help bring to our bank system __PUNCT__ hi word __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that a bet we can't afford __PUNCT__
we can't afford to roll the dice by privat social secur __PUNCT__ and wager the nest egg of million of american on wall street __PUNCT__
we can't afford to gambl on more of the same trickl down philosophi that shower tax break on big corpor and the wealthiest few __PUNCT__
we tri that __PUNCT__
it doesn't work __PUNCT__
with our economi at risk __PUNCT__ and our futur in the balanc __PUNCT__ the greatest risk in thi elect is to repeat the same mistak of the past __PUNCT__
we can't take a chanc on the same lose game __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will chang thi economi so that it final work for your famili __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will fight for the middl class everi singl dai __PUNCT__ and that exactli what i do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we have a differ wai of measur the fundament of our economi __PUNCT__
we know that the fundament that we us to measur econom strength ar whether we ar live up to that fundament promis that ha made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that america is a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__ that everyon should have the chanc to live their dream __PUNCT__
i know i wouldn't be stand here todai without that promis __PUNCT__
and i know that the promis we must keep onc more __PUNCT__
when i talk to those young veteran who come back from iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ i see my grandfath __PUNCT__ who sign up after pearl harbor __PUNCT__ march in patton armi __PUNCT__ and wa reward by a grate nation with the chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
in the face of that young student who sleep just three hour befor work the night shift __PUNCT__ i think about my mom __PUNCT__ who rais my sister and me on her own while she work and earn her degre __PUNCT__ who onc turn to food stamp but wa still abl to send us to the best school in the countri __PUNCT__
and when i listen to anoth worker tell me that hi factori ha shut down __PUNCT__ i rememb all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decad ago after the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
these ar my hero __PUNCT__

i know that we have to overcom our doubt and divis and the determin opposit of power special interest befor we can truli reform a broken economi and advanc opportun __PUNCT__
but i am run for presid becaus we simpli cannot afford four more year of an econom philosophi that work for wall street instead of main street __PUNCT__ and end up devast both __PUNCT__
i don't want to wake up in four year to find that more american fell out of the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and more famili lost their save __PUNCT__
i don't want to see that our countri fail to invest in our abil to compet __PUNCT__ our children futur wa mortgag on anoth mountain of debt __PUNCT__ and our financi market fail to find a firmer foot __PUNCT__
