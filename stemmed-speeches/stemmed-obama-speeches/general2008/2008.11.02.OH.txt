ohio __PUNCT__ i have just two word for you __PUNCT__ two dai __PUNCT__
after decad of broken polit in washington __PUNCT__ eight year of fail polici from georg bush __PUNCT__ and twenti __PUNCT__ on month of a campaign that ha taken us from the rocki coast of main to the sunshin of california __PUNCT__ we ar two dai awai from chang in america __PUNCT__
in two dai __PUNCT__ you can turn the page on polici that have put the greed and irrespons of wall street befor the hard work and sacrific of folk on main street __PUNCT__
in two dai __PUNCT__ you can choos polici that invest in our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ creat new job __PUNCT__ and grow thi economi so that everyon ha a chanc to succe __PUNCT__ from the ceo to the secretari and the janitor __PUNCT__ from the factori owner to the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
in two dai __PUNCT__ you can put an end to the polit that would divid a nation just to win an elect __PUNCT__ that tri to pit region against region __PUNCT__ citi against town __PUNCT__ republican against democrat __PUNCT__ that ask us to fear at a time when we need hope __PUNCT__
in two dai __PUNCT__ at thi defin moment in histori __PUNCT__ you can give thi countri the chang we need __PUNCT__
we began thi journei in the depth of winter nearli two year ago __PUNCT__ on the step of the old state capitol in springfield __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ we didn't have much monei or mani endors __PUNCT__
we weren't given much of a chanc by the poll or the pundit __PUNCT__
we knew how steep our climb would be __PUNCT__
but i also knew thi __PUNCT__
i knew that the size of our challeng had outgrown the small of our polit __PUNCT__
i believ that democrat and republican and american of everi polit stripe were hungri for new idea __PUNCT__ new leadership __PUNCT__ and a new kind of polit __PUNCT__ on that favor common sens over ideolog __PUNCT__ on that focus on those valu and ideal we hold in common as american __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ i knew the american peopl were a decent __PUNCT__ gener peopl will to work hard and sacrific for futur gener __PUNCT__
i wa convinc that when we come togeth __PUNCT__ our voic ar more power than the most entrench lobbyist __PUNCT__ or the most viciou polit attack __PUNCT__ or the full forc of a statu quo in washington that want to keep thing just the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
twenti __PUNCT__ on month later __PUNCT__ my faith in the american peopl ha been vindic __PUNCT__
that how we come so far and so close __PUNCT__ becaus of you __PUNCT__
that how we chang thi countri __PUNCT__ with your help __PUNCT__
and that why we can't afford to slow down __PUNCT__ sit back __PUNCT__ or let up for on dai __PUNCT__ on minut __PUNCT__ or on second in these last few dai __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when so much is at stake __PUNCT__
we ar in the middl of the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
__NUM__ worker have lost their job thi year __PUNCT__
busi and famili can't get credit __PUNCT__
home valu ar fall __PUNCT__
pension ar disappear __PUNCT__
it gotten harder and harder to make the mortgag __PUNCT__ or fill up your ga tank __PUNCT__ or even keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__
at a moment like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we can afford is four more year of the tire __PUNCT__ old theori that sai we should give more to billionair and big corpor and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
the last thing we can afford is four more year where no on in washington is watch anyon on wall street becaus politician and lobbyist kill common __PUNCT__ sens regul __PUNCT__
those ar the theori that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
thei haven't work __PUNCT__ and it time for chang __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha serv thi countri honor __PUNCT__
and he can point to a few moment over the past eight year where he ha broken from georg bush __PUNCT__
but when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ when it come to the central issu of thi elect __PUNCT__ the plain truth is that john mccain ha stood with thi presid everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
vote for the bush tax cut for the wealthi that he onc oppos __PUNCT__
vote for the bush budget that spent us into debt __PUNCT__
call for less regul twenti __PUNCT__ on time just thi year __PUNCT__
those ar the fact __PUNCT__
after twenti __PUNCT__ on month and three debat __PUNCT__ senat mccain still ha not been abl to tell the american peopl a singl major thing he do differ from georg bush when it come to the economi __PUNCT__
when john mccain want to give a __MONEY__ tax cut to the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
it not chang when he want to give __MONEY__ billion to the biggest corpor or __MONEY__ billion to the oil compani or __MONEY__ billion to the same wall street bank that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
it not chang when he come up with a tax plan that doesn't give a penni of relief to more than __NUM__ million middl __PUNCT__ class american __PUNCT__
presid bush is sit out the last few dai befor the elect __PUNCT__
but yesterdai __PUNCT__ dick chenei came out of hi undisclos locat and hit the campaign trail __PUNCT__
he said that he is __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ delight to support john mccain __PUNCT__
i like to congratul senat mccain on thi endors becaus he realli earn it __PUNCT__
that endors didn't come easi __PUNCT__
senat mccain had to vote __NUM__ percent of the time with georg bush and dick chenei to get it __PUNCT__
he serv as washington biggest cheerlead for go to war in iraq __PUNCT__ and support econom polici that ar no differ from the last eight year __PUNCT__
so senat mccain work hard to get dick chenei support __PUNCT__
but here my question for you __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ do you think dick chenei is delight to support john mccain becaus he think john mccain go to bring chang __PUNCT__ do you think john mccain and dick chenei have been talk about how to shake thing up __PUNCT__ and get rid of the lobbyist and the old boi club in washington __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ we know better __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ it wa just a week ago that senat mccain said that he and presid bush share a __PUNCT__ common philosophi __PUNCT__
and we know that when it come to foreign polici __PUNCT__ john mccain and dick chenei share a common philosophi that think that empti bluster from washington will fix all of our problem __PUNCT__ and a war without end in iraq is the wai to defeat osama bin laden and the al qaeda terrorist who ar in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
so georg bush mai be in an undisclos locat __PUNCT__ but dick chenei out there on the campaign trail becaus he be delight to pass the baton to john mccain __PUNCT__
he know that with john mccain you get a twofer __PUNCT__ georg bush econom polici and dick chenei foreign polici __PUNCT__ but that a risk we cannot afford to take __PUNCT__
it time for chang __PUNCT__ and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we tri it john mccain wai __PUNCT__
we tri it georg bush and dick chenei wai __PUNCT__
deep down __PUNCT__ senat mccain know that __PUNCT__ which is why hi campaign said that __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
that why i talk about the economi __PUNCT__
that why he spent these last week call me everi name in the book __PUNCT__
becaus that how you plai the game in washington __PUNCT__
when you can't win on the strength of your idea __PUNCT__ you make a big elect about small thing __PUNCT__
so i expect we go to see a lot more of that over the next few dai __PUNCT__
more of the slash and burn __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ anyth __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ anyth polit that calcul to divid and distract __PUNCT__ to tear us apart instead of bring us togeth __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that not the kind of polit the american peopl need right now __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ at thi moment __PUNCT__ in thi elect __PUNCT__ we have the chanc to do more than just beat back thi kind of polit in the short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
we can end it onc and for all __PUNCT__
we can prove that the on thing more power than the polit of anyth goe is the will and determin of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we can chang thi countri __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
we can prove that we ar not as divid as our polit would suggest __PUNCT__ that we ar more than a collect of red state and blue state __PUNCT__ we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__ with a new polit for a new time __PUNCT__
we can build the futur we know is possibl __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
but i also know that we have face difficult time befor __PUNCT__
the american stori ha never been about thing come easi __PUNCT__ it been about rise to the moment when the moment wa hard __PUNCT__
it about reject fear and divis for uniti of purpos __PUNCT__
that how we overcom war and depress __PUNCT__
that how we won great struggl for civil right and women right and worker __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
and that how we write the next great chapter in the american stori __PUNCT__
understand __PUNCT__ if we want to meet the challeng of thi moment __PUNCT__ we need to get beyond the old ideolog debat and divid between left and right __PUNCT__
we don't need bigger govern or smaller govern __PUNCT__
we need a better govern __PUNCT__ a more compet govern __PUNCT__ a govern that uphold the valu we hold in common as american __PUNCT__
the choic in thi elect isn't between tax cut and no tax cut __PUNCT__
it about whether you believ we should onli reward wealth __PUNCT__ or whether we should also reward the work and worker who creat it __PUNCT__
i will give a tax break to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of american who work everi dai and get tax taken out of their paycheck everi week __PUNCT__
and i help pai for thi by ask the folk who ar make more than __MONEY__ a year to go back to the tax rate thei were pai in the 1990 __PUNCT__
no matter what senat mccain mai claim __PUNCT__ here ar the fact __PUNCT__ if you make under __MONEY__ you will not see your tax increas by a singl dime __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__
becaus the last thing we should do in thi economi is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
when it come to job __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect is not between put up a wall around america or stand by and do noth __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ we won't be abl to bring back everi job that we lost __PUNCT__ but that doesn't mean we should follow john mccain plan to keep give tax break to corpor that send american job oversea and promot unfair trade agreement __PUNCT__
i will end those break as presid __PUNCT__ and give them to compani that creat job here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we creat two million new job by rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ and school __PUNCT__
and i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new energi job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
when it come to health care __PUNCT__ we don't have to choos between a govern __PUNCT__ run health care system and the unafford on we have now __PUNCT__
if you alreadi have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and as someon who watch hi own mother spend the final month of her life argu with insur compani becaus thei claim her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__ i will stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
when it come to give everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ the choic is not between more monei and more reform __PUNCT__ becaus our school need both __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ pai them more __PUNCT__ and give them more support __PUNCT__
but i will also demand higher standard and more account from our teacher and our school __PUNCT__
and i will make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
and when it come to keep thi countri safe __PUNCT__ we don't have to choos between retreat from the world and fight a war without end in iraq __PUNCT__
it time to stop spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq while the iraqi govern sit on a huge surplu __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will end thi war __PUNCT__
i will ask the iraqi govern to step up for their futur __PUNCT__ and i will final finish the fight against bin laden and the al qaeda terrorist who attack us on 9/11 __PUNCT__
i will never hesit to defend thi nation __PUNCT__
and i will make sure our servicemen and women have the best train and equip when thei deploi into combat __PUNCT__ and the care and benefit thei have earn when thei come home __PUNCT__
that what we ow our veteran __PUNCT__
that what i do as presid __PUNCT__
i won't stand here and pretend that ani of thi will be easi __PUNCT__ especi now __PUNCT__
the cost of thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ and the cost of the war in iraq __PUNCT__ mean that washington will have to tighten it belt and put off spend on thing we don't need __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will go through the feder budget __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ end program that we don't need and make the on we do need work better and cost less __PUNCT__
but as i said from the dai we began thi journei __PUNCT__ the chang we need won't come from govern alon __PUNCT__
it will come from each of us do our part in our own live and our own commun __PUNCT__
it will come from each of us look after ourselv __PUNCT__ our famili __PUNCT__ and our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ govern must lead the wai on energi independ __PUNCT__ but each of us must do our part to make our home and our busi more effici __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we must put more monei into our school __PUNCT__ but govern can't be that parent who turn off the tv and make a child do their homework __PUNCT__
we need a return to respons and a return to civil __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we can argu and debat our posit passion __PUNCT__ but all of us must summon the strength and grace to bridg our differ and unit in common effort __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ gai and straight __PUNCT__ disabl or not __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ we cannot afford the same polit game and tactic that ar be us to pit us against on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
despit what our oppon mai claim __PUNCT__ there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
there is no citi or town that is more pro __PUNCT__ america than anywher els __PUNCT__ we ar on nation __PUNCT__ all of us proud __PUNCT__ all of us patriot __PUNCT__
the men and women who serv on our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
it won't be quick __PUNCT__
but you and i know that it is time to come togeth and chang thi countri __PUNCT__
some of you mai be cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what ha been ask of american throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ not just in my abil to bring about chang __PUNCT__ but in your __PUNCT__
i know thi chang is possibl __PUNCT__
becaus i have seen it over the last twenti __PUNCT__ on month __PUNCT__
becaus in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i have had the privileg to wit what is best in america __PUNCT__
i seen it in the face of the men and women i met at countless ralli and town hall across the countri __PUNCT__ men and women who speak of their struggl but also of their hope and dream __PUNCT__
i still rememb the email that a woman name robyn sent me after i met her in ft __PUNCT__ lauderdal __PUNCT__
sometim after our event __PUNCT__ her son nearli went into cardiac arrest __PUNCT__ and wa diagnos with a heart condit that could onli be treat with a procedur that cost ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
her insur compani refus to pai __PUNCT__ and their famili just didn't have that kind of monei __PUNCT__
in her email __PUNCT__ robyn wrote __PUNCT__ i ask onli thi of you __PUNCT__ on the dai where you feel so tire you can't think of utter anoth word to the peopl __PUNCT__ think of us __PUNCT__
when those who oppos you have you down __PUNCT__ reach deep and fight back harder __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ that what hope is __PUNCT__
that what kept some of our parent and grandpar go when time were tough __PUNCT__
what led them to sai __PUNCT__ mayb i can't go to colleg __PUNCT__ but if i save a littl bit each week __PUNCT__ my child can __PUNCT__
mayb i can't have my own busi but if i work realli hard my child can open up on of her own __PUNCT__
it what led those who could not vote to sai __PUNCT__ if i march and organ __PUNCT__ mayb my child or grandchild can run for presid somedai __PUNCT__
that what hope is __PUNCT__ that thing insid that insist __PUNCT__ despit all evid to the contrari __PUNCT__ that there ar better dai ahead __PUNCT__
if we will to work for it __PUNCT__
if we will to shed our fear __PUNCT__
if we will to reach deep insid ourselv when we tire __PUNCT__ and come back fight harder __PUNCT__
don't believ for a second thi elect is over __PUNCT__
don't think for a minut that power conced __PUNCT__
we have to work like our futur depend on it in these last few dai __PUNCT__ becaus it doe __PUNCT__
but i know thi __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ the time for chang ha come __PUNCT__
we have a righteou wind at our back __PUNCT__
and in these last coupl of dai __PUNCT__ i need you to knock on some door for me __PUNCT__ and make some call for me __PUNCT__ and go to __URL__ and find out where to vote __PUNCT__ and rememb __PUNCT__ you can vote earli here in ohio __PUNCT__
