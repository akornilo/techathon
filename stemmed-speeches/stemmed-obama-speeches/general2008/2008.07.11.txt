i often said that the decis we make in thi elect and in the next few year will set the cours for the next gener __PUNCT__
that is true of the war in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
it true of our economi __PUNCT__
and it is especi true of our energi polici __PUNCT__
the urgenc of thi challeng is clear to anyon who tri to fill up their tank with ga that now over __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
it clear to the legion of scientist who believ that we ar near a point of no return when it come to our global climat crisi __PUNCT__
and with each pass dai __PUNCT__ it is clear that our addict to fossil fuel is on of the most seriou threat to our nation secur in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
for the last eight year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha narrowli defin secur as fight an open __PUNCT__ end war in iraq __PUNCT__
but in the interconnect world of thi new centuri __PUNCT__ new threat come from stateless terrorist __PUNCT__ loos nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ the spread of pandem diseas __PUNCT__ an inabl to compet with rise power in the global economi __PUNCT__ the threat of global climat chang and our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
i be talk about these threat next week and in the week to come __PUNCT__ and todai i like to begin with those relat to energi __PUNCT__
we now know that the carbon emiss releas by countri across the globe ar warm our planet __PUNCT__ which lead to devast weather pattern __PUNCT__ terribl storm __PUNCT__ drought __PUNCT__ and famin __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ studi show that by __NUM__ famin could displac more than __NUM__ million peopl worldwid __PUNCT__
that mean peopl compet for food and water in the next fifti year in the veri place that have known horrif violenc in the last fifti __PUNCT__ africa __PUNCT__ the middl east __PUNCT__ and south asia __PUNCT__
that is a threat to our secur __PUNCT__
an even more immedi and direct secur threat come from our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
the price of a barrel of oil is now on of the most danger weapon in the world __PUNCT__
tyrant from caraca to tehran us it to prop up their regim __PUNCT__ intimid the intern commun __PUNCT__ and hold us hostag to a market that is subject to their whim __PUNCT__
if iran decid to shut down the petroleum __PUNCT__ rich strait of hormuz tomorrow __PUNCT__ thei believ oil would skyrocket to __MONEY__ in minut __PUNCT__ a price that on specul predict would result in __MONEY__ ga __PUNCT__
__MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
the nearli __MONEY__ million a dai we send to unstabl or hostil nation also fund both side of the war on terror __PUNCT__ pai for everyth from the madrassa that plant the seed of terror in young mind to the bomb that go off in baghdad and kabul __PUNCT__
our oil addict even present a target for osama bin laden __PUNCT__ who ha told al qaeda __PUNCT__ focu your oper on oil __PUNCT__ sinc thi will caus __PUNCT__ the american __PUNCT__ to die off on their own __PUNCT__
if we stai on our current cours __PUNCT__ the rapid growth of nation like china and india will rise about on __PUNCT__ third by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in that same year __PUNCT__ middl eastern regim will be sit on __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our global oil reserv __PUNCT__
imagin that __PUNCT__ the veri sourc of energi that fuel nearli all of our transport __PUNCT__ control almost entir by some of the world most unstabl and undemocrat govern __PUNCT__
thi is not the futur i want for america __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri that place our fate in the hand of dictat and tyrant __PUNCT__ we ar a nation that control our own destini __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
that who we alwai been __PUNCT__
it what led us to wage a revolut that brought down an empir __PUNCT__
it why we built an arsen of democraci to defeat fascism __PUNCT__ and stop the spread of commun with the power of our ideal __PUNCT__
and it why we must end the tyranni of oil in our time __PUNCT__
thi is a debat we been have in thi campaign __PUNCT__ but it also an issu we been talk about for decad __PUNCT__
we have heard promis about energi independ from everi singl u. __PUNCT__ presid sinc richard nixon __PUNCT__
we heard talk about curb our us of fossil fuel in nearli everi state of the union address sinc the oil embargo __NUM__ __PUNCT__
back then we import about a third of our oil __PUNCT__
todai we import over half __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ a few dai ago __PUNCT__ senat mccain said __PUNCT__ our danger depend on foreign oil ha been thirti year in the make __PUNCT__ and wa caus by the failur of politician in washington to think long __PUNCT__ term about the futur of the countri __PUNCT__
i couldn't agre more __PUNCT__
the onli problem is that out of those thirti year __PUNCT__ senat mccain wa in washington for twenti __PUNCT__ six of them __PUNCT__
and in that time he ha achiev littl to help reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
he vote against rais our fuel mileag standard and join georg bush in oppos legisl twice in the last year that includ tax credit for more effici car __PUNCT__
he vote against altern sourc of energi __PUNCT__
against clean biofuel __PUNCT__
against solar power __PUNCT__
against wind power __PUNCT__
against an energi bill that repres the largest invest in renew sourc of energi in the histori of thi countri __PUNCT__
so when he talk about the failur of politician in washington to do anyth about our energi crisi __PUNCT__ understand that senat mccain ha been a part of that failur __PUNCT__
when he propos polici that give __MONEY__ billion in tax break to oil compani but onli penni a dai to american struggl with high ga price __PUNCT__ understand that that not part of the solut in washington __PUNCT__ that part of the problem in washington __PUNCT__
when he offer a plan that doesn't make ani real invest in altern sourc of energi __PUNCT__ that repres a failur to think long __PUNCT__ term about our nation futur __PUNCT__
that what we had in thi countri for too mani year __PUNCT__ and that why we need chang in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
i won't pretend thi chang will be easi or that it will come without signific cost or some measur of sacrific from the american peopl __PUNCT__
achiev energi independ is on of the greatest challeng we ever face __PUNCT__ and it will be the great project of our gener __PUNCT__
but i seen that progress is possibl __PUNCT__
when i arriv in the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i work with democrat and republican to pass a law that will give more american the chanc to fill up their car with clean biofuel __PUNCT__
i also pass a law that will fuel the research need to develop a car that could get up to __NUM__ mile to the gallon __PUNCT__
and i reach across the aisl to come up with a plan to rais the mileag standard in our car for the first time in thirti year __PUNCT__ a plan that won support from democrat and republican who had never support rais fuel standard befor __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ with oil and ga price thi high __PUNCT__ we hear a lot of plan and propos come out of washington sinc politician ar final pai attent __PUNCT__
the problem is __PUNCT__ thei react instead of act __PUNCT__
thei search for easi answer to get them through the next elect instead of seriou __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ term solut that will offer real relief and real secur for america __PUNCT__
i understand the polit __PUNCT__
in a countri desper for action __PUNCT__ idea like a ga tax holidai or expand oil drill in the water off our coast ar popular __PUNCT__
and i sai thi __PUNCT__ if there were real evid that these step would actual provid real __PUNCT__ immedi relief at the pump and advanc the long __PUNCT__ term goal of energi independ __PUNCT__ of cours i be open to them __PUNCT__
but so far there isn't __PUNCT__
as good as thei sound __PUNCT__ the histori of ga tax holidai is that the price go up to fill in the gap __PUNCT__ and the big winner end up be the retail and oil compani __PUNCT__ not the american peopl __PUNCT__
that what happen when we had a ga tax holidai in illinoi that i support __PUNCT__ and that why we end up repeal it __PUNCT__
it didn't work __PUNCT__
and it would also drain the feder highwai fund of billion of dollar and cost hundr of thousand of american job __PUNCT__
when it come to offshor drill __PUNCT__ even senat mccain ha acknowledg that it won't provid short __PUNCT__ term relief __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ if we start drill todai __PUNCT__ we wouldn't see a drop of oil for seven year __PUNCT__ and even then it would have littl if ani impact on price __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ the oil compani current have the right to drill on __NUM__ million acr of land and offshor area that thei haven't touch __PUNCT__
i believ that befor we give the oil compani ani more land __PUNCT__ it time we tell them to start drill on the land thei alreadi have or turn it over to someon who will __PUNCT__ becaus we need that oil __PUNCT__
we should also invest in the technolog that can help us recov more oil from exist field __PUNCT__
and we should also look to our substanti natur ga reserv to tap a sourc of energi that alreadi power buse and car here and around the world __PUNCT__
in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ we have to rememb that these domest resourc ar finit __PUNCT__
even if you open up everi squar inch of our land and our coast to drill __PUNCT__ america still ha onli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the world oil reserv __PUNCT__
senat mccain mai believ otherwis __PUNCT__ but that is not a real solut to our energi crisi __PUNCT__
what we need ar real idea to give hardwork american relief from high ga price __PUNCT__ and seriou __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ term invest to perman reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
that exactli what my plan doe __PUNCT__
to provid immedi relief __PUNCT__ i propos a second __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion stimulu packag that would send energi rebat check to everi american __PUNCT__
i ask senat mccain to join me in pass such a plan __PUNCT__ and i extend that invit again todai __PUNCT__
i also propos a __MONEY__ middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut that will go to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all worker and their famili __PUNCT__
and i crack down on oil specul who mai be artifici drive up the price of oil __PUNCT__
but to truli reduc our long __PUNCT__ term depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ my plan will fast __PUNCT__ track __MONEY__ billion of invest in a clean energi fund to help creat the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car and altern sourc of energi that will secur thi nation and jumpstart a green economi __PUNCT__
it a plan that will reduc our oil consumpt __NUM__ million barrel per dai by __NUM__ which is more than all the oil we expect to import from opec nation in that same year __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we doubl our fuel mileag standard over the next two decad util much of the technolog we have on the shelf todai __PUNCT__ a step that will save thi countri half a trillion gallon of gasolin __PUNCT__ the equival of cut the price of a gallon of ga in half __PUNCT__
and i will provid tax credit and loan guarante for our automak to help them make thi transit __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we launch a ventur capit fund that will provid __MONEY__ billion over five year to get the most promis clean energi technolog out of the lab and into the marketplac __PUNCT__
a princip focu of thi fund will be continu the work i began in the senat and invest in plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid batteri that will allow car to get up to __NUM__ mile per gallon __PUNCT__
i glad that senat mccain now understand the import of thi batteri technolog __PUNCT__ but it will take a lot more than a cash prize to achiev thi goal __PUNCT__
it will take a seriou invest __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ to creat a market for altern sourc of energi like solar __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ i requir that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our electr come renew sourc by __NUM__ and that we produc two billion gallon of advanc cellulos biofuel by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we also invest in find cleaner wai to us coal __PUNCT__ our nation most abund energi sourc __PUNCT__ and safer wai to us nuclear power and store nuclear wast __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we us our clean energi fund to invest over __MONEY__ billion a year to re __PUNCT__ tool and modern our factori and build the advanc technolog car __PUNCT__ truck and suv of the futur __PUNCT__ so that the job and industri of the futur ar creat right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ on of the fastest __PUNCT__ easiest __PUNCT__ and cheapest wai to conserv energi and us less oil is to make america more energi effici and more competit with the world __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ i will call on busi __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ and the american peopl to make america __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more energi effici by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
when all is said and done __PUNCT__ my plan to invest __MONEY__ billion in altern energi will creat entir new industri __PUNCT__ thousand of new busi __PUNCT__ and up to five million new __PUNCT__ green job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
and we pai for all of it by take awai tax break for oil compani and put a price on carbon pollut __PUNCT__ a step that will also reduc our carbon emiss __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
most importantli __PUNCT__ thi plan will ensur that we control the energi we us with resourc and technolog that ar avail todai __PUNCT__
the step i just spoke about ar not far __PUNCT__ off __PUNCT__ pie __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ sky solut __PUNCT__ thei ar now __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar wait list for fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__
there an old steel mill in pennsylvania that ha becom the home of a new wind turbin factori __PUNCT__
i seen a small busi in nevada power entir by solar power __PUNCT__
across the planet __PUNCT__ countri like germani and the unit kingdom have alreadi implement clean energi polic that ar reduc their carbon emiss right now __PUNCT__ and leader like toni blair and angela merkel have done a great job of rais the visibl of climat chang within the g8 __PUNCT__
now it our turn to lead __PUNCT__ to show that thi futur is possibl for america __PUNCT__
in the last centuri __PUNCT__ dure the dai that follow the attack on pearl harbor __PUNCT__ the american peopl were ask __PUNCT__ almost overnight __PUNCT__ to transform a peacetim economi that wa still climb out from the depth of depress into an arsen of democraci that could wage war across three contin __PUNCT__
mani doubt whether thi could be achiev in time __PUNCT__ or even at all __PUNCT__
presid franklin roosevelt own advisor told him that hi goal for wartim product were unrealist and imposs to meet __PUNCT__
but the presid simpli wave them off __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ believ me __PUNCT__ the product peopl can do it if thei realli try __PUNCT__
the challeng we face from our energi depend is great __PUNCT__
meet it will take time __PUNCT__ and it will not be easi __PUNCT__
but if we will to work at it __PUNCT__ and invest in it __PUNCT__ and sacrific for it __PUNCT__ if we will to summon the same spirit of optim and possibl that ha defin thi countri greatest progress __PUNCT__ then i believ that we too will be abl to do it if we realli try __PUNCT__
and i look forward to try with you __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
