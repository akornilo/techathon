it great to be back in dover __PUNCT__
we made our first stop in new hampshir over __NUM__ month ago __PUNCT__ and a lot ha chang __PUNCT__
there ar babi walk and talk todai who weren't even born back then __PUNCT__
but there on thing that hasn't chang in those __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the american peopl know thi countri is on the wrong track __PUNCT__ and you know that we need new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
the good new is that in __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ the name georg bush will not be on the ballot __PUNCT__
but make no mistak __PUNCT__ hi polici will __PUNCT__
a few week ago __PUNCT__ john mccain said that the economi is __PUNCT__ fundament strong __PUNCT__ and a few dai later georg bush said the same thing __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha said that we made __PUNCT__ great progress econom __PUNCT__ over the last eight year __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__
i think thei truli believ it __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ my oppon said just last night __PUNCT__ it easi for me to go to washington and frankli __PUNCT__ be somewhat divorc from the dai __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ dai challeng peopl have __PUNCT__
so from where he and georg bush sit __PUNCT__ mayb thei just can't see __PUNCT__
mayb thei ar just that out of touch __PUNCT__
but you know the truth __PUNCT__ and so do i __PUNCT__
for eight year __PUNCT__ we fail to keep that american promis that if you work hard you can live your american dream __PUNCT__
under the bush econom polici that my oppon support and promis to continu __PUNCT__ the averag famili ha seen their incom drop by __MONEY__ while the cost of everyth from ga to groceri ha gone up __PUNCT__
we have the highest unemploy rate in five year __PUNCT__
home valu have plummet __PUNCT__
it harder to save and it harder to retir __PUNCT__
those ar the dai __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ dai challeng that peopl have __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of thi so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ progress __PUNCT__
we can't afford anoth presid who is so out of touch that he think the economi is strong and that chang is do the exact same thing as georg bush __PUNCT__
that what senat mccain is offer __PUNCT__
more of the discredit theori that if you shower benefit on big corpor __PUNCT__ special interest and the wealthiest of the wealthi __PUNCT__ it will all come trickl down to the middl class __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ dover __PUNCT__ how much of that ha trickl down to you __PUNCT__ how much ha trickl down to the american who have lost their job and their home __PUNCT__ how much ha trickl down to the famili that can't afford to pai next month bill or the kid who can't afford colleg __PUNCT__ we tri thi for eight year __PUNCT__ and we can't afford to keep try it for anoth four __PUNCT__
we can't afford to keep spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq while the iraqi govern sit on a surplu __PUNCT__
we can't afford more of the same addict to oil __PUNCT__
more of the same health care polici that onli work for the healthi and wealthi __PUNCT__
more of the same washington lobbyist who run john mccain campaign __PUNCT__
more of the same bush __PUNCT__ rove __PUNCT__ mccain polit that tri to distract you from polici that ar destroi the middl class __PUNCT__
we tri that wai __PUNCT__
it won't work __PUNCT__
and yet senat mccain stubbornli hold to it __PUNCT__
the onli chang he offer is complet the bush agenda __PUNCT__
privat your social secur __PUNCT__
tax your health benefit __PUNCT__
and anoth __MONEY__ billion of budget __PUNCT__ bust tax break for corpor like exxon __PUNCT__ mobil that have just turn in the greatest profit in histori __PUNCT__ while you can bare afford to fill up a tank of ga __PUNCT__
it time for us to sai __PUNCT__ enough is enough __PUNCT__
now my oppon want to have a debat about chang __PUNCT__ and that a debat that i welcom __PUNCT__
becaus the choic in thi elect is veri simpl __PUNCT__
if you ar better off than you were eight year ago and you want four more year of a presid who put the special interest and the biggest corpor first __PUNCT__ then vote for john mccain __PUNCT__
if you believ it time for fundament chang in washington and a presid who put the middl class first __PUNCT__ then we will win thi elect in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and we will chang thi countri for our children and our grandchildren __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it time for chang __PUNCT__
and let me tell you exactli what that chang will look like __PUNCT__
chang mean a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyist who wrote it __PUNCT__ but the american worker and senior and small busi who deserv it __PUNCT__
take a close look at the tax cut i propos and the special interest giveawai that my oppon is propos __PUNCT__ becaus that will tell you everyth you need to know about who we go to put first as presid __PUNCT__
i will cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ percent of all work american __PUNCT__
i will reward work through a __PUNCT__ make work pai __PUNCT__ tax credit of __MONEY__ for american worker and __MONEY__ for work famili __PUNCT__
becaus when i presid __PUNCT__ we rewrit the tax code to work for the middl class __PUNCT__ not washington lobbyist __PUNCT__
that chang __PUNCT__
i will eas the burden on struggl homeown through a univers homeown tax credit __PUNCT__
thi will add up to a __NUM__ percent break off the mortgag interest rate for __NUM__ million household __PUNCT__
that anoth __MONEY__ each year for most middl class famili __PUNCT__
that chang __PUNCT__
i will make sure our senior can afford to retir with the digniti and secur thei have earn __PUNCT__
that why i will elimin incom tax for senior make less than __MONEY__
thi will end incom tax for __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__ at a save of roughli __MONEY__ each year __PUNCT__
that chang __PUNCT__
i will make colleg afford for everi singl american who ha the talent and drive to go with an annual __MONEY__ tax credit for anyon who commit to __NUM__ hour of public servic __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ and america invest in you __PUNCT__ that how we make colleg afford for everi american __PUNCT__
that chang __PUNCT__
i think we need to encourag growth __PUNCT__
senat mccain think we need to give __MONEY__ billion a year in tax break for corpor __PUNCT__ but not a singl new tax break for small busi __PUNCT__ even though small busi ar the sourc of __NUM__ percent of the new job in our economi __PUNCT__
i will elimin capit gain tax for the small busi and start __PUNCT__ up that will creat the high __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ and help them afford health insur for their employe __PUNCT__
that how america is go to compet __PUNCT__
that how we go to build the middl class __PUNCT__
that chang __PUNCT__
we need a tax code that creat american job instead of ship them oversea __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ just thi week we learn that if an american compani creat job in the unit state __PUNCT__ thei pai more than twice as much in tax than if that same compani creat job in china __PUNCT__
so you pai more than twice as much to creat job in dover than shanghai __PUNCT__
that a direct result of what we gotten from washington year after year after year __PUNCT__ and it time for that to chang __PUNCT__
my oppon ha vote for those tax break __PUNCT__ and he continu them as presid __PUNCT__
i will end tax break for compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and start invest in american job and worker __PUNCT__
to pai for these tax cut __PUNCT__ i stand up to special interest carv __PUNCT__ out __PUNCT__ close corpor loophol and offshor tax haven __PUNCT__ and ask the wealthiest american to give back a portion of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
it time for folk like me who make over __MONEY__ to pai our fair share to keep the american promis aliv for our children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
when you run for four more year of georg bush polici __PUNCT__ it hard to run on your plan __PUNCT__
so you make stuff up __PUNCT__
you twist fact __PUNCT__ and you don't tell the truth __PUNCT__ that what john mccain ha done when it come to my tax plan __PUNCT__
so let be clear about what we ar propos __PUNCT__
my plan __PUNCT__ all togeth __PUNCT__ is a net tax cut __PUNCT__
my plan will cut tax to a smaller share of the economi than thei were under presid reagan __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ incom tax for typic american famili will be the lowest that thei been in more than a half centuri __PUNCT__
everyon in america __PUNCT__ everyon __PUNCT__ will pai lower tax than thei would under the rate bill clinton had in the 1990 __PUNCT__
and under my plan __PUNCT__ middl class famili will get three time as much relief as senat mccain is offer __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ hi plan give absolut noth to over __NUM__ million american household __PUNCT__
and i can make a firm pledg __PUNCT__ under my plan __PUNCT__ no famili make less than __MONEY__ will see their tax increas __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ not ani of your tax __PUNCT__
my oppon can't make that pledg __PUNCT__ and here why __PUNCT__ for the first time in american histori __PUNCT__ he want to tax your health benefit appar __PUNCT__ senat mccain doesn't think it enough that your health premium have doubl __PUNCT__ he think you should have to pai tax on them too __PUNCT__
that a __MONEY__ trillion tax increas on middl class famili __PUNCT__
that will eventu leav ten of million of you pai higher tax __PUNCT__
that hi idea of chang __PUNCT__
now i do want to be fair __PUNCT__
senat mccain is offer some tax cut __PUNCT__
he spend nearli __MONEY__ trillion over a decad in tax break for corpor __PUNCT__
he would continu the bush tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
hi plan give more than a half million dollar in tax cut for household make over __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
now i know that senat mccain ha said that onli those make over __MONEY__ million a year ar rich __PUNCT__ so mayb he think that folk make __MONEY__ million ar middl class __PUNCT__
we cannot afford four more year of out of touch __PUNCT__ on your own __PUNCT__ leadership in the white hous __PUNCT__
john mccain like to rail against the washington herd __PUNCT__ but the truth is __PUNCT__ when it come to the issu that realli matter in your live __PUNCT__ he been run in that herd for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and thei run thi economi into a ditch __PUNCT__
thi elect is our chanc to stand up and sai __PUNCT__ enough is enough __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__
the kind of chang we look for never is __PUNCT__
what we ar up against is a veri power __PUNCT__ entrench statu quo in washington who will sai anyth and do anyth and fight with everyth thei got to keep thing just the wai ar __PUNCT__
but i feel good about our chanc __PUNCT__ becaus i got someth more power than thei do __PUNCT__ i got you __PUNCT__
in thi campaign __PUNCT__ you have alreadi shown what histori teach us __PUNCT__ that at defin moment like thi on __PUNCT__ the chang we need doesn't come from washington __PUNCT__
chang come to washington __PUNCT__
thi elect is our chanc to choos an economi that reward your work and advanc your dream __PUNCT__
but i need your help __PUNCT__
i ask you to knock on some door __PUNCT__ and make some call __PUNCT__ and talk to your neighbor __PUNCT__ and give me your vote on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and if you do __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ we will chang america togeth __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
