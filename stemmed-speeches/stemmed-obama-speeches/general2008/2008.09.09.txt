dayton __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ yesterdai wa a special dai around my hous __PUNCT__
it wa back __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ school dai for my girl __PUNCT__
sasha start second grade and malia began __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i know malia wa realli embarrass when i walk her to the classroom __PUNCT__ but i did it anywai becaus she still daddi girl __PUNCT__
and see them back at school wa a remind not onli that anoth year had pass and that thei grow up a littl faster than i sometim like __PUNCT__
it wa also a remind of all the other parent who ar drop their children off at school __PUNCT__ and all the other kid who ar get readi for anoth year of class __PUNCT__
everi four year __PUNCT__ we hear candid talk about the vital import of educ __PUNCT__ about how improv our school is kei to the futur of our children and the futur of our countri __PUNCT__
everi four year __PUNCT__ we hear about how thi time __PUNCT__ we go to make it an urgent nation prioriti __PUNCT__
rememb the __NUM__ elect __PUNCT__ when georg w __PUNCT__ bush promis to be the __PUNCT__ educ presid __PUNCT__
but just as with energi independ and health care __PUNCT__ the urgenc of upgrad public educ for the __NUM__ centuri ha been talk to death in washington __PUNCT__
and that failur to act ha put our nation in jeopardi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the dai of reckon is here __PUNCT__
our kid and our countri can't afford four more year of neglect and indiffer __PUNCT__
at thi defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__ america face few more urgent challeng than prepar our children to compet in a global economi __PUNCT__
the decis our leader make about educ in the come year will shape our futur for gener to come __PUNCT__
thei will help determin not onli whether our children have the chanc to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__ or whether our worker have the chanc to build a better life for their famili __PUNCT__ but whether we __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__ will remain in the __NUM__ centuri the kind of global econom leader that we were in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
the rise import of educ reflect the new demand of our new world __PUNCT__
in recent decad __PUNCT__ revolut in commun and inform technolog have broken down barrier that onc kept countri and market apart __PUNCT__ creat a singl __PUNCT__ global economi that is more integr and interconnect than ever befor __PUNCT__
in thi economi __PUNCT__ compani can plant their job wherev there an internet connect and someon will to do the work __PUNCT__ mean that children here in dayton ar grow up compet with children not onli in detroit __PUNCT__ but in delhi as well __PUNCT__
what matter __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ isn't what you do or where you live __PUNCT__ but what you know __PUNCT__
when two __PUNCT__ third of all new job requir a higher educ or advanc train __PUNCT__ knowledg is the most valuabl skill you can sell __PUNCT__
it not onli a pathwai to opportun __PUNCT__ but a prerequisit __PUNCT__
without a good pre __PUNCT__ school educ __PUNCT__ our children ar less like to keep up with their peer __PUNCT__
without a high school diploma __PUNCT__ you like to make about three time less than a colleg graduat __PUNCT__
and without a colleg degre or industri certif __PUNCT__ it harder and harder to find a job that can help you support your famili and keep up with rise cost __PUNCT__
but it not just that a world __PUNCT__ class educ is essenti for worker to compet and win __PUNCT__ it that an educ workforc is essenti for america to compet and win __PUNCT__
without a workforc train in math __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ and technolog and the other skill of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ our compani will innov less __PUNCT__ our economi will grow less __PUNCT__ and our nation will be less competit __PUNCT__
if we want to outcompet the world tomorrow __PUNCT__ we must out __PUNCT__ educ the world todai __PUNCT__
if we want to keep build the car of the futur here in america __PUNCT__ we can't afford to see the number of phd in engin climb in china __PUNCT__ south korea __PUNCT__ and japan even as it drop here in america __PUNCT__ we can't afford a futur where our high school student rank near the bottom in math and scienc __PUNCT__ and our high school drop __PUNCT__ out rate is on of the highest in the industri world __PUNCT__
if we want to build a __NUM__ centuri infrastructur and repair our crumbl road and bridg __PUNCT__ we can't afford a futur where a third of all __NUM__ grader and a fifth of all __NUM__ grader can't do basic math __PUNCT__ and black and latino student ar even further behind __PUNCT__ where elementari school kid ar onli get an averag __NUM__ minut of scienc each dai when over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the fastest __PUNCT__ grow job requir some knowledg in math and scienc __PUNCT__
if we want to see middl class incom rise like thei did in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ we can't afford a futur where so mani american ar price out of colleg __PUNCT__ where onli __NUM__ percent of our student ar prepar to take colleg __PUNCT__ level english __PUNCT__ math __PUNCT__ and scienc __PUNCT__ where million of job ar go unfil becaus american don't have the skill to work them __PUNCT__ and where bare on in ten low __PUNCT__ incom student will ever get their colleg degre __PUNCT__
that kind of futur is econom unten for america __PUNCT__
it is moral unaccept for our children __PUNCT__
and it is not who we ar as a nation __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that ha alwai renew our system of educ to meet the challeng of a new time __PUNCT__
lincoln creat the land grant colleg to ensur the success of the union he wa fight to save __PUNCT__
gener of leader built mandatori public school to prepar our children for the chang need of our nation __PUNCT__
and eisenhow doubl feder invest in educ after the soviet beat us to space __PUNCT__
that is the kind of leadership we must show todai __PUNCT__
but that not the leadership we been get from washington __PUNCT__
for decad __PUNCT__ thei been stuck in the same tire debat over educ that have crippl our progress and left school and parent to fend for themselv __PUNCT__
it been democrat versu republican __PUNCT__ voucher versu the statu quo __PUNCT__ more monei versu more reform __PUNCT__
there partisanship and there bicker __PUNCT__ but there no understand that both side have good idea that we need to implement if we hope to make the chang our children need __PUNCT__
and we fallen further and further behind as a result __PUNCT__
if we go to make a real and last differ for our futur __PUNCT__ we have to be will to move beyond the old argument of left and right and take meaning __PUNCT__ practic step to build an educ system worthi of our children and our futur __PUNCT__
in the past few week __PUNCT__ my oppon ha taken to talk about the need for chang and reform in washington __PUNCT__ where he ha been part of the scene for about three decad __PUNCT__
and in those three decad __PUNCT__ he ha not done on thing to truli improv the qualiti of public educ in our countri __PUNCT__
not on real propos or law or initi __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he march with the ideologu in hi parti in oppos effort to hire more teacher __PUNCT__ and expand head start __PUNCT__ and make colleg more afford __PUNCT__
you don't reform our school by oppos effort to fulli fund no child left behind __PUNCT__
and you certainli don't reform our educ system by call to close the depart of educ __PUNCT__
that would just make it harder for us to give out financi aid __PUNCT__ harder for us to keep track of how our school ar do __PUNCT__ and lead to widen inequ in who get a colleg degre __PUNCT__
that is not my idea of reform __PUNCT__
that is not my idea of chang __PUNCT__
that is not a plan to help your kid compet with those kid in china and india __PUNCT__
after three decad of indiffer on educ __PUNCT__ do you realli believ that john mccain is go to make a differ now __PUNCT__
john mccain doesn't get it __PUNCT__
he doesn't understand that our success as a nation depend on our success in educ __PUNCT__
i do __PUNCT__
that why last __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i propos an educ agenda that move beyond parti and ideolog and focus instead on what will make the most differ in a child life __PUNCT__
my plan call for give everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ from the dai thei born until the dai thei graduat from colleg __PUNCT__
it a plan that start with invest in earli __PUNCT__ childhood educ becaus we know that children in these program ar more like to score higher in read and math __PUNCT__ more like to graduat high school and attend colleg __PUNCT__ more like to hold a job and earn more in that job __PUNCT__
and it a plan that will final put a colleg degre within reach for anyon who want on by provid a __MONEY__ tax credit to ani middl class student who will to serv their commun or their countri __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we also have to fix the broken promis of no child left behind __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i believ that the goal of thi law were the right on __PUNCT__
make a promis to educ everi child with an excel teacher is right __PUNCT__
close the achiev gap that exist in too mani citi and rural area is right __PUNCT__
more account is right __PUNCT__
higher standard ar right __PUNCT__
but i tell you what wrong with no child left behind __PUNCT__
forc our teacher __PUNCT__ our princip __PUNCT__ and our school to accomplish all of thi without the resourc thei need is wrong __PUNCT__
promis high __PUNCT__ qualiti teacher in everi classroom and then leav the support and the pai for those teacher behind is wrong __PUNCT__
label a school and it student as failur on dai and then throw your hand up and walk awai from them the next is wrong __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ don't tell us that the onli wai to teach a child is to spend most of the year prepar him to fill in a few bubbl on a standard test __PUNCT__
let final help our teacher and princip develop a curriculum and assess that teach our kid to becom more than just good test __PUNCT__ taker __PUNCT__
we need assess that can improv achiev by includ the kind of research __PUNCT__ scientif investig __PUNCT__ and problem __PUNCT__ solv that our children will need to compet in a __NUM__ centuri knowledg economi __PUNCT__
we must fix the failur of no child left behind __PUNCT__
we must provid the fund we were promis __PUNCT__ and give our state the resourc thei need __PUNCT__ and final meet our commit to special educ __PUNCT__
but democrat have to realiz that fix no child left behind is not enough to prepar our children for a global economi __PUNCT__
we need a new vision for a __NUM__ centuri educ __PUNCT__ on where we aren't just support exist school __PUNCT__ but spur innov __PUNCT__ where we not just invest more monei __PUNCT__ but demand more reform __PUNCT__ where parent take respons for their children success __PUNCT__ where our school and govern ar account for result __PUNCT__ where we recruit __PUNCT__ retain __PUNCT__ and reward an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and student ar excit to learn becaus thei attend school of the futur __PUNCT__ and where we expect all our children not onli to graduat high school __PUNCT__ but to graduat colleg and get a good pai job __PUNCT__
it time to ask ourselv why other countri ar outperform us in educ __PUNCT__
becaus it not that their kid ar smarter than our __PUNCT__ it that thei be smarter about how to educ their kid __PUNCT__
thei spend less time teach thing that don't matter and more time teach thing that do __PUNCT__
their student ar spend more time in school __PUNCT__ and thei set higher expect __PUNCT__
that what we need to be do __PUNCT__ becaus america isn't a countri that accept second place __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we fight to make sure we onc again first in the world when it come to high school graduat rate __PUNCT__
we push our kid to studi harder and aim higher __PUNCT__
i work with republican senat jim demint on a bill that would challeng high school student to take colleg __PUNCT__ level cours __PUNCT__ and make sure low __PUNCT__ incom neighborhood and rural commun have access to those cours __PUNCT__
and i make it the law of the land when i presid __PUNCT__
and we also set a goal of increas the number of high school student take colleg __PUNCT__ level or ap cours by __NUM__ percent in the come year __PUNCT__
becaus i believ that when we challeng our kid to succe __PUNCT__ thei will __PUNCT__
a while back __PUNCT__ i wa talk with my friend arn duncan __PUNCT__ who run the chicago public school __PUNCT__
he wa explain how he manag to increas the number of kid take and pass ap cours in chicago over the last few year __PUNCT__
what he said wa __PUNCT__ our kid aren't smarter than thei were three year ago __PUNCT__ our expect for them ar just higher __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i think it time we rais expect for our kid all across thi countri __PUNCT__ and that what we do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
the second thing we need to do is make sure that we prepar our kid for the __NUM__ centuri economi by bring our school system into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
part of what that mean is foster the kind of school that will help prepar our kid __PUNCT__ which is why i call for the creation of an innov school fund __PUNCT__
thi fund will invest in school like the austin polytechn academi __PUNCT__ which is locat in a part of chicago that been hard hit by the declin in manufactur over the past few decad __PUNCT__
thank to partnership with a number of compani __PUNCT__ a curriculum that prepar student for a career in engin __PUNCT__ and a requir that student graduat with at least two industri certif __PUNCT__ austin polytech is bring hope back to the commun __PUNCT__
and that the kind of model we replic across the countri when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
give our parent real choic about where to send their kid to school also mean show the same kind of leadership at the nation level that i did in illinoi when i pass a law to doubl the number of charter school in chicago __PUNCT__
that is why as presid __PUNCT__ i doubl the fund for respons charter school __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know you had a tough time with for __PUNCT__ profit charter school here in ohio __PUNCT__
that is why i work with governor strickland to hold for __PUNCT__ profit charter school account __PUNCT__ and i work with all our nation governor to hold all our charter school account __PUNCT__
charter school that ar success will get the support thei need to grow __PUNCT__
and charter that aren't will get shut down __PUNCT__
and we help ensur that more of our kid have access to qualiti afterschool and summer school and extend school dai for student who need it __PUNCT__ becaus if thei can do that in china __PUNCT__ we can do that right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
as we bring our school system into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we also have to bring our school into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
becaus while technolog ha transform just about everi aspect of our live __PUNCT__ from the wai we travel to the wai we commun to the wai we look after our health __PUNCT__ on of the place where we fail to seiz it full potenti is in the classroom __PUNCT__
imagin a futur where our children ar more motiv becaus thei aren't just learn on blackboard but on new whiteboard with digit touch screen __PUNCT__ where everi student in a classroom ha a laptop at their desk __PUNCT__ where thei don't just do book report but design powerpoint present __PUNCT__ where thei don't just write paper but build websit __PUNCT__ where research isn't done just by take a book out of the librari but by email expert in the field __PUNCT__ and where teacher ar less a sourc of knowledg than a coach for how best to us it __PUNCT__
by foster innov __PUNCT__ we can help make sure everi school in america is a school of the futur __PUNCT__
that what we do when i presid __PUNCT__
we help school integr technolog into their curriculum so we can make sure public school student ar fluent in the digit languag of the __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
we teach our student not onli math and scienc __PUNCT__ but teamwork __PUNCT__ and critic think and commun skill __PUNCT__ becaus that how we make sure thei prepar for todai workplac __PUNCT__
but no matter how mani choic we give our parent or how much technolog we us in our school or how tough our class ar __PUNCT__ none of it will make much differ if we don't also recruit __PUNCT__ prepar __PUNCT__ and retain outstand teacher __PUNCT__
becaus from the moment a child enter a school __PUNCT__ the most import factor in their success is the person stand at the front of the classroom __PUNCT__
that why last year __PUNCT__ i propos a new servic scholarship program that will recruit top talent into the profess __PUNCT__ and place these new teacher in overcrowd district and struggl rural town __PUNCT__ or hard __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ staff subject like special educ in school across the nation __PUNCT__
to prepar these new teacher __PUNCT__ i creat more teacher resid program that will build on a law i recent pass and train __NUM__ high __PUNCT__ qualiti teacher a year __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
to support our teacher __PUNCT__ we expand mentor program that pair experienc __PUNCT__ success teacher with new recruit __PUNCT__
and when our teacher succe in make a real differ in our children live __PUNCT__ we should reward them for it by find new wai to increas teacher pai that ar develop with teacher __PUNCT__ not impos on them __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
from princ georg counti in maryland to denver __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ we see teacher and school board come togeth to design perform pai plan __PUNCT__
so ye __PUNCT__ we must give teacher everi tool thei need to be success __PUNCT__
but we also need to give everi child the assur that thei have the teacher thei need to be success __PUNCT__
that mean set a firm standard __PUNCT__ teacher who ar do a poor job will get extra support __PUNCT__ but if thei still don't improv __PUNCT__ thei be replac __PUNCT__
becaus as good teacher ar the first to tell you __PUNCT__ if we go to attract the best teacher to the profess __PUNCT__ we can't settl for school fill with poor teacher __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know thi sound like a lot __PUNCT__ but we can do it all __PUNCT__ we can increas the number of student take colleg __PUNCT__ level cours __PUNCT__ expand innov and school choic __PUNCT__ invest in the school of tomorrow __PUNCT__ and put a qualiti teacher in everi classroom __PUNCT__ all for the cost of just a few dai in iraq __PUNCT__
and we pai for that cost by carefulli wind down the war in iraq __PUNCT__ by end no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ and by elimin wast spend __PUNCT__
so we make these invest __PUNCT__ but we do it without mortgag our children futur on an even larger amount of debt __PUNCT__
we do it respons __PUNCT__
thi lead me to my final point __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will lead a new era of account in educ __PUNCT__
but i don't just want to hold our teacher account __PUNCT__
i want you to hold our govern account __PUNCT__
i want you to hold me account __PUNCT__
that why everi year i presid __PUNCT__ i will report back to you on the progress our school ar make __PUNCT__
becaus it time to stop pass the buck on educ __PUNCT__ and start accept respons __PUNCT__ and that the kind of exampl i set as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
account in washington start by make sure that everi tax dollar spent by the depart of educ is be spent wise __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ program that work will get more monei __PUNCT__
program that don't will get less __PUNCT__
and we send a team to fix bad program by replac bad manag __PUNCT__
becaus your tax dollar should onli be fund program and grant that actual make a differ in a child educ __PUNCT__
but in the end __PUNCT__ respons for our children success doesn't start in washington __PUNCT__
it start in our home __PUNCT__
it start in our famili __PUNCT__
becaus no educ polici can replac a parent who involv in their child educ from dai on __PUNCT__ who make sure their children ar in school on time __PUNCT__ help them with their homework after dinner __PUNCT__ and attend those parent __PUNCT__ teacher confer __PUNCT__
no govern program can turn off the tv __PUNCT__ or put awai the video game __PUNCT__ or read to your children __PUNCT__
but we can help parent do a better job __PUNCT__
that why i creat a parent report card that will show you whether your kid is on the path to colleg __PUNCT__
we help school post student progress report onlin so you can get a regular updat on what kind of grade your child is get on test and quizz from week to week __PUNCT__
if your kid is fall behind __PUNCT__ or plai hooki __PUNCT__ or isn't on track to go to colleg or compet for that good pai job __PUNCT__ it will be up to you to do someth about it __PUNCT__
so ye __PUNCT__ we need to hold our govern account __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we have to hold our school account __PUNCT__
but we also have to hold ourselv account __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when i drop my daughter off at school yesterdai __PUNCT__ i couldn't help but think about all america had done over the year to give me and my famili a good educ __PUNCT__
thi is a countri that put my grandfath through colleg on the gi bill after he left patton armi __PUNCT__
thi is a countri that drew my father __PUNCT__ like so mani immigr __PUNCT__ across an ocean in search of a colleg degre __PUNCT__
and thi is a countri that let the child of a teenag mom and an absent father reach for hi dream __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i wasn't born with a lot of advantag __PUNCT__
but i wa given love __PUNCT__ and support __PUNCT__ and an educ that put me on a pathwai to success __PUNCT__
the same wa true for michel __PUNCT__
she came from a blue collar famili on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__
even though her father had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ he went to work everi dai at the local water filtrat plant to support hi famili __PUNCT__
and michel and her brother were abl to go to a great colleg __PUNCT__ and reach a littl further for their dream __PUNCT__
so i know that the onli reason michel and i ar where we ar todai is becaus thi countri we love gave us the chanc at an educ __PUNCT__
and the reason i run for presid is to give everi singl american that same chanc __PUNCT__ to give the young sister out there born with a gift for invent the chanc to becom the next orvil and wilbur wright __PUNCT__ to give the young boi out there who want to creat a life __PUNCT__ save cure the chanc to becom the next jona salk __PUNCT__ and to give the child out there whose imagin ha been spark by the wonder of the internet the chanc to becom the next bill gate __PUNCT__
our futur depend on it __PUNCT__
when the stori of our time is told __PUNCT__ i don't want it to be said that china seiz thi moment to reform it educ system __PUNCT__ but the unit state did not __PUNCT__
i don't want it to be said that india led the wai on innov __PUNCT__ but the unit state did not __PUNCT__
i want it to be said that we rose to meet thi challeng __PUNCT__ and educ our peopl to becom the most highli __PUNCT__ skill worker in the world __PUNCT__ just like we alwai have been __PUNCT__
becaus i know that if we can just bring our educ system into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ not onli will our children be abl to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__ and our famili be abl to live out their dream __PUNCT__ not onli will our school out __PUNCT__ educ the world and our worker outcompet the world __PUNCT__ not onli will our compani innov more and our economi grow more __PUNCT__ but at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ we will do what previou gener of american have done __PUNCT__ and unleash the promis of our peopl __PUNCT__ unlock the promis of our countri __PUNCT__ and make sure that america remain a beacon of opportun and prosper for all the world __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
