we meet here at a time of great uncertainti __PUNCT__
our economi is in crisi __PUNCT__
the dream of so mani american ar at risk __PUNCT__
and the american peopl ar wait for leadership from washington __PUNCT__
on mondai __PUNCT__ over the cours of a few hour __PUNCT__ the failur to pass the econom rescu plan in the hous led to the singl largest declin of the stock market in two decad __PUNCT__
over on trillion dollar of wealth wa lost by the time the market close __PUNCT__
and it wasn't just the wealth of a few ceo or wall street execut __PUNCT__
the 401k and retir account that million count on for their famili futur ar now smaller __PUNCT__
the state pension fund of teacher and govern employe lost billion upon billion of dollar __PUNCT__
hardwork american who invest their nest egg to watch it grow ar now watch it disappear __PUNCT__
but while the declin of the stock market is devast __PUNCT__ the consequ of the credit crisi that caus it will be even wors if we do not act and act immedi __PUNCT__
becaus of the hous crisi __PUNCT__ we ar now in a veri danger situat where financi institut across thi countri ar afraid to lend monei __PUNCT__
if all that meant wa the failur of a few big bank on wall street __PUNCT__ it would be on thing __PUNCT__
but that not what it mean __PUNCT__
what it mean is that if we do not act __PUNCT__ it will be harder for you to get a mortgag for your home or the loan you need to bui a car or send your children to colleg __PUNCT__
what it mean is that busi won't be abl to get the loan thei need to open new factori __PUNCT__ or hire more worker __PUNCT__ or make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
thousand of busi could close __PUNCT__
million of job could be lost __PUNCT__
a long and pain recess could follow __PUNCT__
let me be perfectli clear __PUNCT__
the fact that we ar in thi mess is an outrag __PUNCT__
it an outrag becaus we did not get here by accid __PUNCT__
thi wa not a normal part of the busi cycl __PUNCT__
thi wa not the action of a few bad appl __PUNCT__
thi financi crisi is a direct result of the greed and irrespons that ha domin washington and wall street for year __PUNCT__
it the result of specul who game the system __PUNCT__ regul who look the other wai __PUNCT__ and lobbyist who bought their wai into our govern __PUNCT__
it the result of an econom philosophi that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__ a philosophi that view even the most common __PUNCT__ sens regul as unwis and unnecessari __PUNCT__
and thi crisi is the final verdict on thi fail philosophi __PUNCT__ a philosophi that we cannot afford to continu __PUNCT__
but while there is plenti of blame to go around and mani in washington and on wall street who deserv it __PUNCT__ all of us now have a respons to solv thi crisi becaus it affect the financi well __PUNCT__ be of everi singl american __PUNCT__
there will be time to punish those who set thi fire __PUNCT__ but now is the moment for us to come togeth and put the fire out __PUNCT__
i know that mani of you ar feel anxieti right now __PUNCT__ about your job __PUNCT__ about your home __PUNCT__ about your life save __PUNCT__
but i also know thi __PUNCT__ i know that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus that who we ar __PUNCT__
becaus thi is the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with confid __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
thi is not just a wall street crisi __PUNCT__ it an american crisi __PUNCT__ and it the american economi that need thi rescu plan __PUNCT__
i understand why peopl would be skeptic when thi presid ask for a blank check to solv a problem __PUNCT__
i spent most of my time in washington be skeptic of thi administr __PUNCT__ and thi time wa no differ __PUNCT__
that why over a week ago __PUNCT__ i demand that thi plan includ specif propos to protect the american taxpay __PUNCT__ protect that the administr eventu agre to __PUNCT__ as well as democrat and republican in congress __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i said we need an independ board to provid oversight and account for how and where thi monei is spent at everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i said that we cannot help bank on wall street without help the million of innoc homeown who ar struggl to stai in their home __PUNCT__
thei deserv a plan too __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i said that i would not allow thi plan to becom a welfar program for the wall street execut whose greed and irrespons got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i said that if american taxpay ar financ thi solut __PUNCT__ then you should be treat like investor __PUNCT__ you should get everi penni of your tax dollar back onc thi economi recov __PUNCT__
thi last part is import __PUNCT__ becaus it been the most misunderstood and poorli commun part of thi plan __PUNCT__
thi is not a plan to just hand over __MONEY__ billion of your monei to a few bank __PUNCT__
if thi is manag correctli __PUNCT__ we will hopefulli get most or all of our monei back __PUNCT__ or possibl even turn a profit on the govern invest __PUNCT__ everi penni of which will go directli back to you __PUNCT__ the investor __PUNCT__
the rescu plan now includ those four principl __PUNCT__
it also includ a propos i made yesterdai morn to expand feder deposit insur for famili and small busi across america who have invest their monei in our bank __PUNCT__
thi will boost small busi __PUNCT__ make our bank system more secur __PUNCT__ and help restor confid by reassur famili that their monei is safe __PUNCT__
even with all these taxpay protect __PUNCT__ thi plan is not perfect __PUNCT__
democrat and republican in congress have legitim concern about it __PUNCT__
i know mani american share those concern __PUNCT__
but it is clear that thi is what we must do right now to prevent a crisi from turn into a catastroph __PUNCT__
that why i been reach out to leader in both parti to do whatev i can to help pass thi plan __PUNCT__
that why i be fly back to washington todai to cast my vote to safeguard the american economi __PUNCT__
and to the democrat and republican who have oppos thi plan __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__ step up to the plate and do what right for the countri __PUNCT__ becaus the time to act is now __PUNCT__
i know mani american ar wonder what happen next __PUNCT__
pass thi bill will not be the end of our work to strengthen our economi __PUNCT__ it just the begin of a long __PUNCT__ hard road ahead __PUNCT__
so let me tell you exactli how i move forward as presid __PUNCT__
from the moment i take offic __PUNCT__ my top prioriti will be to do everyth i can to make sure that your tax dollar ar protect __PUNCT__
i will demand a full review of thi financi rescu plan to make sure that it is work for you __PUNCT__
if you __PUNCT__ the american taxpay __PUNCT__ ar not get your monei back __PUNCT__ then we will chang how thi program is be manag __PUNCT__
if need be __PUNCT__ we will send new legisl to congress to make sure that taxpay ar protect in line with the principl that i have put forward __PUNCT__
you should expect noth less from washington __PUNCT__
if we do have loss __PUNCT__ i propos a financi stabil fee on the financi servic industri so wall street foot the bill __PUNCT__ not the american taxpay __PUNCT__
and as i modern the financi system to creat new rule of the road to prevent anoth crisi __PUNCT__ we will continu thi fee to build up a reserv so that if thi happen again __PUNCT__ it will be the monei contribut by bank that put at risk __PUNCT__
thi will onli work if there is real enforc and real account __PUNCT__
and that start with presidenti leadership __PUNCT__
so let me be veri clear __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ financi institut will do their part and pai their share __PUNCT__ and american taxpay will never again have to put their monei on the line to pai for the greed and irrespons of wall street __PUNCT__
that a pledg that i make to you todai __PUNCT__ and it on that i keep as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
account must start with thi rescu plan __PUNCT__ but it cannot end there __PUNCT__
across wisconsin __PUNCT__ and across the countri __PUNCT__ famili ar sit down at the kitchen tabl and make hard choic __PUNCT__
you plan for your futur in tough time __PUNCT__
you squeez just a littl bit more out of next month paycheck so you can pai next month bill __PUNCT__
it time for washington to do the same __PUNCT__
we cannot mortgag our children futur on a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
it time to put an end to the run __PUNCT__ awai spend and the record deficit __PUNCT__ it not how you would run your famili budget __PUNCT__ and it must not be how washington handl your tax dollar __PUNCT__
it time to return to the fiscal respons and pai as you go budget that we had in the 1990 __PUNCT__
mani in congress have been fight for these commonsens principl __PUNCT__ and i will be a presid who support them and make sure thei succe __PUNCT__
that why i not go to stand here and simpli tell you what i go to spend __PUNCT__ i go to start by tell you how we go to save when i am presid __PUNCT__
i will go through the entir feder budget __PUNCT__ page by page __PUNCT__ line by line __PUNCT__ and elimin the program that don't work and aren't need __PUNCT__
we should start by end a war in iraq that is cost us __MONEY__ billion a month while the iraqi govern sit on a __MONEY__ billion surplu __PUNCT__
we should stop send __MONEY__ billion a year in overpay to insur compani for medicar __PUNCT__ and go after ten of billion of dollar in medicar and medicaid fraud __PUNCT__
we need to stop send three billion a year to bank that provid student loan the govern could provid for less __PUNCT__
and we can end the hundr of million a year in subsidi to agribusi that can surviv just fine without your tax dollar __PUNCT__ and us some of the monei to help struggl famili farmer __PUNCT__
that what i do as presid __PUNCT__
and we can't stop there __PUNCT__
we lose __MONEY__ billion everi year becaus corpor set up mailbox offshor so thei can avoid pai a dime of tax in america __PUNCT__
in the senat __PUNCT__ i work across the aisl to crack down on these scheme __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i will shut down those offshor tax haven and all those corpor loophol onc and for all __PUNCT__
you shouldn't have to pai higher tax becaus some big corpor cut corner to avoid pai their __PUNCT__
all of us have a respons to pai our fair share __PUNCT__
that account __PUNCT__
and that what we have when i presid __PUNCT__
as for the program we do need __PUNCT__ i will make them work better and cost less __PUNCT__
i will creat a high __PUNCT__ perform team of expert that evalu everi agenc and everi offic base on how well thei serv the american taxpay __PUNCT__
i will save billion of dollar by cut privat contractor and improv manag and oversight of the hundr of billion of dollar our govern spend on contract __PUNCT__
and i will final end the abus of no __PUNCT__ bid contract onc and for all __PUNCT__ the dai of sweetheart deal for halliburton will be over when i in the white hous __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ we need to end an era in washington where account ha been absent __PUNCT__ oversight ha been overlook __PUNCT__ and your tax dollar have been turn over to wealthi ceo and well __PUNCT__ connect corpor __PUNCT__
you need leadership that you can trust to work for you __PUNCT__ not for the special interest who have had their thumb on the scale __PUNCT__
and togeth __PUNCT__ we will tell the washington lobbyist that their dai of set the agenda ar over __PUNCT__
thei have not fund thi campaign __PUNCT__ thei won't work in my white hous __PUNCT__ and thei won't drown out the voic of the american peopl when i presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ peopl have ask whether the size of thi rescu plan __PUNCT__ togeth with the weaken economi __PUNCT__ mean that the next presid will have to scale back hi agenda and some of hi propos __PUNCT__
the answer is ye and no __PUNCT__
with less monei flow into the treasuri __PUNCT__ some us program or polici that i propos on the campaign trail mai need to be delai __PUNCT__
but there ar certain invest in our futur that we cannot delai precis becaus our economi is in turmoil __PUNCT__
you can alwai put off give your hous a new paint job or renov your kitchen __PUNCT__ but when your roof is crumbl or your heater goe __PUNCT__ you realiz that these ar long __PUNCT__ term invest you need to make right awai __PUNCT__
the same is true of our economi __PUNCT__
we cannot wait to help american keep up with rise cost and shrink paycheck by give our worker a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut __PUNCT__
we cannot wait to reliev the burden of crush health care cost __PUNCT__
we cannot wait to creat million of new job by rebuild our road and our bridg and invest in the renew sourc of energi that will stop us from send __MONEY__ billion a year to tyrant and dictat for their oil __PUNCT__
and we cannot wait to educ the next gener of american with the skill and knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
those ar the prioriti we cannot delai __PUNCT__
as soon as we pass thi rescu plan __PUNCT__ we need to move with the same sens of urgenc to rescu famili on main street who ar struggl to pai their bill and keep their job __PUNCT__
i said it befor and i sai it again __PUNCT__ we need to pass an econom stimulu plan that will help folk cope with rise food and ga price __PUNCT__ save on million job by rebuild our school and road __PUNCT__ and help state and citi avoid budget cut and tax increas __PUNCT__
a plan that would extend expir unemploy benefit for those american who lost their job and cannot find new on __PUNCT__
beyond thi stimulu __PUNCT__ we need an econom agenda to restor opportun for american and prosper to america __PUNCT__
so that we not borrow debt from china and bui oil from saudi arabia __PUNCT__
so that the job of the futur don't go to better __PUNCT__ educ worker in india and the car of the futur aren't made in japan __PUNCT__
so that we can leav a legaci of greater opportun to our children and their children __PUNCT__
that is how we will emerg from thi crisi stronger and more prosper than we were befor __PUNCT__ and that is what i will do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i will begin by reform our tax code so that it doesn't reward the lobbyist who wrote it __PUNCT__ but the american worker and small busi who deserv it __PUNCT__
