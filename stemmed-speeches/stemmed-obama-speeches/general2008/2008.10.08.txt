we ar face a veri seriou challeng __PUNCT__ and all of us __PUNCT__ all of us __PUNCT__ have a stake in it solut __PUNCT__
becaus the credit market ar frozen right now __PUNCT__ there a rippl effect throughout our economi __PUNCT__
busi larg and small ar find it imposs to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip or make payrol __PUNCT__
auto plant that have been around for decad ar close their door and lai off worker who never known anoth job in their entir life __PUNCT__
and we have alreadi lost three __PUNCT__ quarter of a million job just thi year __PUNCT__
here in indianapoli and all across america __PUNCT__ you see your hour get cut or realiz that you can't pai everi bill that sit on the kitchen counter __PUNCT__
it harder to make the mortgag or fill up your ga tank and some peopl don't even know whether thei be abl to keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__
the monei you been put awai for your retir or your kid __PUNCT__ colleg educ is disappear faster than you can count __PUNCT__
the dream that so mani gener have fought for feel like it slowli slip awai __PUNCT__
but i here todai to tell you that there ar better dai ahead __PUNCT__
i know these ar tough time __PUNCT__
i know that mani of you ar anxiou about the futur __PUNCT__
but thi isn't a time for fear or panic __PUNCT__
thi is a time for resolv and leadership __PUNCT__
i know that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus that who we ar __PUNCT__
becaus thi is the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with confid __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
america still ha the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth who work two job or three job and take the last bu home at night becaus thei want someth more for their children __PUNCT__
we still the home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and our research facil __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but there no reason we can't steer ourselv out of thi crisi and make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
of cours we can __PUNCT__
but i also know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why the decis you make in twenti __PUNCT__ seven dai is so import __PUNCT__
that why thi is no ordinari elect __PUNCT__ becaus thi is no ordinari moment for america __PUNCT__
in last night debat __PUNCT__ john mccain and i each had the chanc to make the case for chang __PUNCT__ to talk about what we would do differ from the last eight year when it come to lift our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ grow our economi __PUNCT__ and restor our prosper __PUNCT__
but all we heard from senat mccain wa more of the same bush econom that led us to thi point __PUNCT__
take health care __PUNCT__
we were both ask whether we believ that health care should final be the right of everi american __PUNCT__
i believ it should __PUNCT__
but senat mccain didn't sai that __PUNCT__
and when you look at hi radic health care plan __PUNCT__ you can see why __PUNCT__
he talk about give everi famili a __MONEY__ credit to bui health care __PUNCT__ but he didn't mention last night that he also tax your benefit for the first time in histori __PUNCT__
it an old washington bait and switch __PUNCT__
he give you a tax credit with on hand __PUNCT__ but rais your tax with the other __PUNCT__
and he didn't mention that the averag health care plan cost __MONEY__ in the first place __PUNCT__
senat mccain didn't tell us about the studi that sai hi plan would caus __NUM__ million american to lose their health insur __PUNCT__ or how the chamber of commerc said it would be a disast for busi __PUNCT__ or how it would de __PUNCT__ regul the insur industri so that thei don't have to cover thing like mammogram __PUNCT__ or vaccin __PUNCT__ or matern care __PUNCT__
he think we won't notic these thing __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i got new for john mccain __PUNCT__ we notic __PUNCT__ we know better __PUNCT__ and we not go to let him get awai with it __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will ensur that insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is the amount you pai in premium __PUNCT__
that will be less __PUNCT__
and if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__ and that the choic you face in thi elect __PUNCT__
even as so mani american ar worri about their medic bill or keep their job or stai in their home __PUNCT__ senat mccain campaign announc last week that thei plan to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the discuss about our economi and spend the final week of thi elect attack me instead __PUNCT__
hi campaign actual said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
well i got new for john mccain __PUNCT__
thi isn't about lose a campaign __PUNCT__ thi is about american who ar lose their job __PUNCT__ and their home __PUNCT__ and their life save __PUNCT__
i can take four more week of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but america can't take four more year of john mccain georg bush polici __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of the econom theori that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
we can't afford more four year of john mccain call for less regul so that no on in washington is watch anyon on wall street __PUNCT__
we seen where that led us and we not go back __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just corpor ceo __PUNCT__ but their secretari too __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass congress last week isn't the end of what we do to strengthen thi economi __PUNCT__ it onli the begin __PUNCT__
now we need to pass a rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class that will provid everi famili immedi relief to cope with rise food and ga price __PUNCT__ save on million job by rebuild our school and road __PUNCT__ and help state and citi avoid budget cut and tax increas __PUNCT__
and we should extend expir unemploy benefit to those american who lost their job and can't find new on __PUNCT__
i been fight for thi plan for month __PUNCT__
my oppon ha said noth __PUNCT__
and that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
you heard a lot about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
well here the truth __PUNCT__ john mccain and i ar both offer tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to give the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo a __MONEY__ tax cut but noth at all to over __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
i give a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all worker __PUNCT__
and if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__ not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
my oppon want to give __MONEY__ million in tax cut to the biggest corpor in america __PUNCT__
i will elimin capit gain tax for the small busi and the start __PUNCT__ up that will creat the high __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
john mccain want to give tax break to the corpor that ship our job oversea __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will end those tax break and give them to compani that creat good job in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
senat mccain first reaction to thi econom crisi wa to sai that __PUNCT__ the fundament of our economi ar strong __PUNCT__
well i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but where i come from there noth more fundament than a job __PUNCT__ not just becaus it provid a paycheck __PUNCT__ becaus it provid a sens of digniti __PUNCT__
and if we want to turn thi economi around and lead the world in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we have to creat the high __PUNCT__ wage job of tomorrow right here in america __PUNCT__

i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__

i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
