we meet at a moment when thi countri is face a set of challeng greater than ani we seen in gener __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ our brave men and women in uniform ar fight two differ war while terrorist plot their next attack __PUNCT__
our chang climat is place our planet in peril __PUNCT__
our economi is in turmoil and our famili ar struggl with rise cost and fall incom __PUNCT__ with lost job and lost home and lost faith in the american dream __PUNCT__
and for too long __PUNCT__ our leader in washington have been unwil or unabl to do anyth about it __PUNCT__
that is why thi elect could be the most import of our lifetim __PUNCT__
when it come to our economi __PUNCT__ our secur __PUNCT__ and the veri futur of our planet __PUNCT__ the choic we make in __DATE__ and over the next few year will shape the next decad __PUNCT__ if not the centuri __PUNCT__
and central to all of these major challeng is the question of what we will do about our addict to foreign oil __PUNCT__
without a doubt __PUNCT__ thi addict is on of the most danger and urgent threat thi nation ha ever face __PUNCT__ from the ga price that ar wipe out your paycheck and strain busi to the job that ar disappear from thi state __PUNCT__ from the instabl and terror bred in the middl east to the rise ocean and record drought and spread famin that could engulf our planet __PUNCT__
it also a threat that goe to the veri heart of who we ar as a nation __PUNCT__ and who we will be __PUNCT__
will we be the gener that leav our children a planet in declin __PUNCT__ or a world that is clean __PUNCT__ and safe __PUNCT__ and thrive __PUNCT__ will we allow ourselv to be held hostag to the whim of tyrant and dictat who control the world oil well __PUNCT__ or will we control our own energi and our own destini __PUNCT__ will america watch as the clean energi job and industri of the futur flourish in countri like spain __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ or germani __PUNCT__ or will we creat them here __PUNCT__ in the greatest countri on earth __PUNCT__ with the most talent __PUNCT__ product worker in the world __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we know the answer to these question __PUNCT__
we know that we cannot sustain a futur power by a fuel that is rapidli disappear __PUNCT__
not when we purchas __MONEY__ million worth of oil everi singl dai from some the world most unstabl and hostil nation __PUNCT__ middl eastern regim that will control nearli all of the world oil by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
not when the rapid growth of countri like china and india mean that we consum more of thi dwindl resourc faster than we ever imagin __PUNCT__
we know that we can't sustain thi kind of futur __PUNCT__
but we also know that we been talk about thi issu for decad __PUNCT__
we heard promis about energi independ from everi singl presid sinc richard nixon __PUNCT__
we heard talk about curb the us of fossil fuel in state of the union address sinc the oil embargo of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ we import about a third of our oil __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we import more than half __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ global warm wa the theori of a few scientist __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it is a fact that is melt our glacier and set off danger weather pattern as we speak __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ the technolog and innov to creat new sourc of clean __PUNCT__ afford __PUNCT__ renew energi wa a gener awai __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ you can find it in the research lab of thi univers and in the design center of thi state legendari auto industri __PUNCT__
it in the chemistri lab that ar lai the build block for cheaper __PUNCT__ more effici solar panel __PUNCT__ and it in the re __PUNCT__ born factori that ar churn out more wind turbin everi dai all across thi countri __PUNCT__
despit all thi __PUNCT__ here we ar __PUNCT__ in anoth elect __PUNCT__ still talk about our oil addict __PUNCT__ still more depend than ever __PUNCT__
why __PUNCT__
you won't hear me sai thi too often __PUNCT__ but i couldn't agre more with the explan that senat mccain offer a few week ago __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ our danger depend on foreign oil ha been thirti year in the make __PUNCT__ and wa caus by the failur of politician in washington to think long __PUNCT__ term about the futur of the countri __PUNCT__
what senat mccain neglect to mention wa that dure those thirti year __PUNCT__ he wa in washington for twenti __PUNCT__ six of them __PUNCT__
and in all that time __PUNCT__ he did littl to reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
he vote against increas fuel effici standard and oppos legisl that includ tax credit for more effici car __PUNCT__
he vote against renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__
against clean biofuel __PUNCT__
against solar power __PUNCT__
against wind power __PUNCT__
against an energi bill that __PUNCT__ while far from perfect __PUNCT__ repres the largest invest in renew sourc of energi in the histori of thi countri __PUNCT__
so when senat mccain talk about the failur of politician in washington to do anyth about our energi crisi __PUNCT__ it import to rememb that he been a part of that failur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ after year of inact __PUNCT__ and in the face of public frustrat over rise ga price __PUNCT__ the onli energi propos he realli promot is more offshor drill __PUNCT__ a posit he recent adopt that ha becom the centerpiec of hi plan __PUNCT__ and on that will not make a real dent in current ga price or meet the long __PUNCT__ term challeng of energi independ __PUNCT__
georg bush own energi depart ha said that if we open up new area to drill todai __PUNCT__ we wouldn't see a singl drop of oil for seven year __PUNCT__
seven year __PUNCT__
and senat mccain know that __PUNCT__ which is why he admit that hi plan would onli provid __PUNCT__ psycholog __PUNCT__ relief to consum __PUNCT__
he also know that if we open up and drill on everi singl squar inch of our land and our shore __PUNCT__ we would still find onli three percent of the world oil reserv __PUNCT__
three percent for a countri that us __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the world oil __PUNCT__
even texa oilman boon picken __PUNCT__ who call for major new invest in altern energi __PUNCT__ ha said __PUNCT__ thi is on emerg we can't drill our wai out of __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ increas domest oil explor certainli ha it place as we make our economi more fuel __PUNCT__ effici and transit to other __PUNCT__ renew __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__ made sourc of energi __PUNCT__
but it is not the solut __PUNCT__
it is a polit answer of the sort washington ha given us for three decad __PUNCT__
there ar genuin wai in which we can provid some short __PUNCT__ term relief from high ga price __PUNCT__ relief to the mother who cut down on groceri becaus of ga price __PUNCT__ or the man i met in pennsylvania who lost hi job and can't even afford to drive around and look for a new on __PUNCT__
i believ we should immedi give everi work famili in america a __MONEY__ energi rebat __PUNCT__ and we should pai for it with part of the record profit that the oil compani ar make right now __PUNCT__
i also believ that in the short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ as we transit to renew energi __PUNCT__ we can and should increas our domest product of oil and natur ga __PUNCT__
but we should start by tell the oil compani to drill on the __NUM__ million acr thei current have access to but haven't touch __PUNCT__
and if thei don't __PUNCT__ we should requir them to give up their leas to someon who will __PUNCT__
we should invest in the technolog that can help us recov more from exist oil field __PUNCT__ and speed up the process of recov oil and ga resourc in shale format in montana and north dakota __PUNCT__ texa and arkansa and in part of the west and central gulf of mexico __PUNCT__
we should sell __NUM__ million barrel of oil from our strateg petroleum reserv for less expens crude __PUNCT__ which in the past ha lower ga price within two week __PUNCT__
over the next five year __PUNCT__ we should also leas more of the nation petroleum reserv in alaska for oil and ga product __PUNCT__
and we should also tap more of our substanti natur ga reserv and work with the canadian govern to final build the alaska natur ga pipelin __PUNCT__ deliv clean natur ga and creat good job in the process __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ none of these step will come close to serious reduc our energi depend in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
we simpli cannot pretend __PUNCT__ as senat mccain doe __PUNCT__ that we can drill our wai out of thi problem __PUNCT__
we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solut __PUNCT__
we have to make a seriou __PUNCT__ nationwid commit to develop new sourc of energi and we have to do it right awai __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ washington final made some progress on thi __PUNCT__
a group of democrat and republican senat sat down and came up with a compromis on energi that includ mani of the propos i work on as a senat and mani of the step i been call for on thi campaign __PUNCT__
it a plan that would invest in renew fuel and batteri for fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ help automak re __PUNCT__ tool __PUNCT__ and make a real invest in renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__
like all compromis __PUNCT__ thi on ha it drawback __PUNCT__
it includ a limit amount of new offshor drill __PUNCT__ and while i still don't believ that a particularli meaning short __PUNCT__ term or long __PUNCT__ term solut __PUNCT__ i am will to consid it if it necessari to actual pass a comprehens plan __PUNCT__
i am not interest in make the perfect the enemi of the good __PUNCT__ particularli sinc there is so much good in thi compromis that would actual reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ while the compromis is a good first step and a good faith effort __PUNCT__ i believ that we must go even further __PUNCT__ and here why __PUNCT__ break our oil addict is on of the greatest challeng our gener will ever face __PUNCT__
it will take noth less than a complet transform of our economi __PUNCT__
thi transform will be costli __PUNCT__ and given the fiscal disast we will inherit from the last administr __PUNCT__ it will like requir us to defer some other prioriti __PUNCT__
it is also a transform that will requir more than just a few govern program __PUNCT__
energi independ will requir an all __PUNCT__ hand __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ deck effort from america __PUNCT__ effort from our scientist and entrepreneur __PUNCT__ from busi and from everi american citizen __PUNCT__
factori will have to re __PUNCT__ tool and re __PUNCT__ design __PUNCT__
busi will need to find wai to emit less carbon dioxid __PUNCT__
all of us will need to bui more of the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car built by thi state __PUNCT__ and find new wai to improv effici and save energi in our own home and busi __PUNCT__
thi will not be easi __PUNCT__
and it will not happen overnight __PUNCT__
and if anyon tri to tell you otherwis __PUNCT__ thei ar either fool themselv or try to fool you __PUNCT__
but i know we can do thi __PUNCT__
we can do thi becaus we ar american __PUNCT__
we do the improb __PUNCT__
we beat great odd __PUNCT__
we ralli togeth to meet whatev challeng stand in our wai __PUNCT__
that what we alwai done __PUNCT__ and it what we must do now __PUNCT__
for the sake of our economi __PUNCT__ our secur __PUNCT__ and the futur of our planet __PUNCT__ we must end the ag of oil in our time __PUNCT__
creat a new energi economi isn't just a challeng to meet __PUNCT__ it an opportun to seiz __PUNCT__ an opportun that will creat new busi __PUNCT__ new industri __PUNCT__ and million of new job __PUNCT__
job that pai well __PUNCT__
job that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
good __PUNCT__ union job __PUNCT__
for a state that ha lost so mani and struggl so much in recent year __PUNCT__ thi is an opportun to rebuild and reviv your economi __PUNCT__
as your wonder governor ha said __PUNCT__ ani time you pick up a newspap and see the term __PUNCT__ climat chang __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ global warm __PUNCT__ just think __PUNCT__ job for michigan __PUNCT__
you ar see the potenti alreadi __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ there ar __NUM__ job in your clean energi sector and __NUM__ compani __PUNCT__
but now is the time to acceler that growth __PUNCT__ both here and across the nation __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will immedi direct the full resourc of the feder govern and the full energi of the privat sector to a singl __PUNCT__ overarch goal __PUNCT__ in ten year __PUNCT__ we will elimin the need for oil from the entir middl east and venezuela __PUNCT__
to do thi __PUNCT__ we will invest __MONEY__ billion over the next ten year and leverag billion more in privat capit to build a new energi economi that har american energi and creat five million new american job __PUNCT__
there ar three major step i will take to achiev thi goal __PUNCT__ step that will yield real result by the end of my first term in offic __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we will help state like michigan build the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car we need __PUNCT__ and we will get on million __NUM__ mile __PUNCT__ per __PUNCT__ gallon plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid on our road within six year __PUNCT__
i know how much the auto industri and the auto worker of thi state have struggl over the last decad or so __PUNCT__
but i also know where i want the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of tomorrow to be built __PUNCT__ not in japan __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__ but right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
right here in the state of michigan __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
when i arriv in washington __PUNCT__ i reach across the aisl to come up with a plan to rais the mileag standard in our car for the first time in thirti year __PUNCT__ a plan that won support from democrat and republican who had never support rais fuel standard befor __PUNCT__
i also led the bipartisan effort to invest in the technolog necessari to build plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid car __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will acceler those effort to meet our urgent need __PUNCT__
with technolog we have on the shelf todai __PUNCT__ we will rais our fuel mileag standard four percent everi year __PUNCT__
we invest more in the research and develop of those plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid __PUNCT__ specif focus on the batteri technolog __PUNCT__
we leverag privat sector fund to bring these car directli to american consum __PUNCT__ and we give consum a __MONEY__ tax credit to bui these vehicl __PUNCT__
but most importantli __PUNCT__ i provid __MONEY__ billion in loan and tax credit to american auto plant and manufactur so that thei can re __PUNCT__ tool their factori and build these car __PUNCT__
that how we not onli protect our auto industri and our auto worker __PUNCT__ but help them thrive in a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
what more __PUNCT__ these effort will lead to an explos of innov here in michigan __PUNCT__
at the turn of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ there were liter hundr of car compani offer a wide choic of steam vehicl and ga engin __PUNCT__
i believ we ar enter a similar era of expand consum choic __PUNCT__ from higher mileag car __PUNCT__ to new electr entrant like gm volt __PUNCT__ to flex fuel car and truck power by biofuel and driven by michigan innov __PUNCT__
the second step i take is to requir that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our energi come from renew sourc by the end of my first term __PUNCT__ more than doubl what we have now __PUNCT__
to meet these goal __PUNCT__ we will invest more in the clean technolog research and develop that occur in lab and research facil all across the countri and right here at msu __PUNCT__ where you work with farm owner to develop thi state wind potenti and develop nanotechnolog that will make solar cell cheaper __PUNCT__
i also extend the product tax credit for five year to encourag the product of renew energi like wind power __PUNCT__ solar power __PUNCT__ and geotherm energi __PUNCT__
it wa becaus of thi credit that wind power grew __NUM__ __PUNCT__ last year __PUNCT__ the largest growth in histori __PUNCT__
expert have said that michigan ha the second best potenti for wind gener and product in the entir countri __PUNCT__
and as the world largest produc of the materi that make solar panel work __PUNCT__ thi tax credit would also help state like michigan grow solar industri that ar alreadi creat hundr of new job __PUNCT__
we also invest feder resourc __PUNCT__ includ tax incent and govern contract __PUNCT__ into develop next gener biofuel __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ i will make it a goal to have __NUM__ billion gallon of our fuel come from sustain __PUNCT__ afford biofuel and we make sure that we have the infrastructur to deliv that fuel in place __PUNCT__
here in michigan __PUNCT__ you actual a step ahead of the game with your first __PUNCT__ ever commerci cellulos ethanol plant __PUNCT__ which will lead the wai by turn wood into clean __PUNCT__ burn fuel __PUNCT__
it estim that each new advanc biofuel plant can add up to __NUM__ job __PUNCT__ expand a local town tax base by __MONEY__ million per year __PUNCT__ and boost local household incom by __MONEY__ million annual __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ we find safer wai to us nuclear power and store nuclear wast __PUNCT__
and we invest in the technolog that will allow us to us more coal __PUNCT__ america most abund energi sourc __PUNCT__ with the goal of creat five __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ kind __PUNCT__ coal __PUNCT__ fire demonstr plant with carbon captur and sequestr __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ too often __PUNCT__ the problem is that all of thi new energi technolog never make it out of the lab and onto the market becaus there too much risk and too much cost involv in start commerci __PUNCT__ scale clean energi busi __PUNCT__
so we will remov some of thi cost and thi risk by direct billion in loan and capit to entrepreneur who ar will to creat clean energi busi and clean energi job right here in america __PUNCT__
as we develop new sourc of energi and electr __PUNCT__ we will also need to modern our nation util grid so that it accommod to new sourc of power __PUNCT__ more effici __PUNCT__ and more reliabl __PUNCT__
that an invest that will also creat hundr of thousand of job __PUNCT__ and on that i will make as presid __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ the third step i will take is to call on busi __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ and the american peopl to meet the goal of reduc our demand for electr __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by the end of the next decad __PUNCT__
thi is by far the fastest __PUNCT__ easiest __PUNCT__ and cheapest wai to reduc our energi consumpt __PUNCT__ and it will save us __MONEY__ billion on our energi bill __PUNCT__
sinc dupont implement an energi effici program in __NUM__ the compani ha significantli reduc it pollut and cut it energi bill by __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
the state of california ha implement such a success effici strategi that while electr consumpt grew __NUM__ __PUNCT__ in thi countri over the last three decad __PUNCT__ it didn't grow at all in california __PUNCT__
there is no reason america can't do the same thing __PUNCT__
we will set a goal of make our new build __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more effici over the next four year __PUNCT__
and we follow the lead of california and chang the wai util make monei so that their profit aren't ti to how much energi we us __PUNCT__ but how much energi we save __PUNCT__
in just ten year __PUNCT__ these step will produc enough renew energi to replac all the oil we import from the middl east __PUNCT__
along with the cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade program i propos __PUNCT__ we will reduc our danger carbon emiss __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ and slow the warm of our planet __PUNCT__
and we will creat five million new job in the process __PUNCT__
if these sound like far __PUNCT__ off goal __PUNCT__ just think about what we can do in the next few year __PUNCT__
on million plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid car on the road __PUNCT__
doubl our energi from clean __PUNCT__ renew sourc like wind power or solar power and __NUM__ billion gallon of afford biofuel __PUNCT__
new build that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more energi effici __PUNCT__
so there is a real choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ a choic about what kind of futur we want for thi countri and thi planet __PUNCT__
senat mccain would not take the step or achiev the goal that i outlin todai __PUNCT__
hi plan invest veri littl in renew sourc of energi and he oppos help the auto industri re __PUNCT__ tool __PUNCT__
like georg bush and dick chenei befor him __PUNCT__ he see more drill as the answer to all of our energi problem __PUNCT__ and like them __PUNCT__ he found a recept audienc in the veri same oil compani that have block our progress for so long __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ he rais more than on million dollar from big oil just last month __PUNCT__ most of which came after he announc hi plan for offshor drill in a room full of cheer oil execut __PUNCT__
hi initi reaction to the bipartisan energi compromis wa to reject it becaus it took awai tax break for oil compani __PUNCT__
and even though he doesn't want to spend much on renew energi __PUNCT__ he actual propos give __MONEY__ billion more in tax break to the biggest oil compani in america __PUNCT__ includ __MONEY__ billion to exxon __PUNCT__ mobil __PUNCT__
thi is a corpor that just record the largest profit in the histori of the unit state __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
thi is the compani that __PUNCT__ last quarter __PUNCT__ made __MONEY__ everi second __PUNCT__
that more than __MONEY__ in the time it take you to fill up a tank with ga that cost you more than __MONEY__
and senat mccain not onli want them to keep everi dime of that monei __PUNCT__ he want to give them more __PUNCT__
so make no mistak __PUNCT__ the oil compani have place their bet on senat mccain __PUNCT__ and if he win __PUNCT__ thei will continu to cash in while our famili and our economi suffer and our futur is put in jeopardi __PUNCT__
well that not the futur i see for america __PUNCT__
i will not pretend the goal i laid out todai aren't ambiti __PUNCT__
thei ar __PUNCT__
i will not pretend we can achiev them without cost __PUNCT__ or without sacrific __PUNCT__ or without the contribut of almost everi american citizen __PUNCT__
but i will sai that these goal ar possibl __PUNCT__
and i will sai that achiev them is absolut necessari if we want to keep america safe and prosper in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
i want you all to think for a minut about the next four year __PUNCT__ and even the next ten year __PUNCT__
we can continu down the path we been travel __PUNCT__
we can keep make small __PUNCT__ piec __PUNCT__ meal invest in renew energi and keep send billion of our hard __PUNCT__ earn dollar to oil compani execut and middl eastern dictat __PUNCT__
we can watch helplessli as the price of ga rise and fall becaus of some foreign crisi we have no control over __PUNCT__ and uncov everi singl barrel of oil buri beneath thi countri onli to realiz that we don't have enough for a few year __PUNCT__ let alon a centuri __PUNCT__
we can watch other countri creat the industri and the job that will fuel our futur __PUNCT__ and leav our children a planet that grow more danger and unliv by the dai __PUNCT__
or we can choos anoth futur __PUNCT__
we can decid that we will face the realiti of the __NUM__ centuri by build a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
in just a few year __PUNCT__ we can watch car that run on a plug __PUNCT__ in batteri come off the same assembl line that onc produc the first ford and the first chrysler __PUNCT__
we can see shutter factori open their door to manufactur that sell wind turbin and solar panel that will power our home and our busi __PUNCT__
we can watch as million of new job with good pai and good benefit ar creat for american worker __PUNCT__ and we can take pride as the technolog __PUNCT__ and discoveri __PUNCT__ and industri of the futur flourish in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we can lead the world __PUNCT__ secur our nation __PUNCT__ and meet our moral oblig to futur gener __PUNCT__
thi is the choic that we face in the month ahead __PUNCT__
thi is the challeng we must meet __PUNCT__
thi is the opportun we must seiz __PUNCT__ and thi mai be our last chanc to seiz it __PUNCT__
and if it seem too difficult or improb __PUNCT__ i ask you to think about the struggl and the challeng that past gener have overcom __PUNCT__
think about how world war ii forc us to transform a peacetim economi still climb out of depress into an arsen of democraci that could wage war across three contin __PUNCT__
and when presid roosevelt advisor inform him that hi goal for wartim product were imposs to meet __PUNCT__ he wave them off and said __PUNCT__ believ me __PUNCT__ the product peopl can do it if thei realli try __PUNCT__
and thei did __PUNCT__
think about when the scientist and engin told john f __PUNCT__ kennedi that thei had no idea how to put a man on the moon __PUNCT__ he told them thei would find a wai __PUNCT__
and we found on __PUNCT__
rememb how we train a gener for a new __PUNCT__ industri economi by build a nationwid system of public high school __PUNCT__ how we laid down railroad track and highwai across an entir contin __PUNCT__ how we push the boundari of scienc and technolog to unlock the veri build block of human life __PUNCT__
i ask you to draw hope from the improb progress thi nation ha made and look to the futur with confid that we too can meet the great test of our time __PUNCT__
i ask you to join me __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ and in the year to come __PUNCT__ to ensur that we will not onli control our own energi __PUNCT__ but onc again control our own destini __PUNCT__ and forg a new and better futur for the countri that we love __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
