you know __PUNCT__ there were a lot of noteworthi moment in that debat __PUNCT__ but there on that stick out thi morn __PUNCT__
it when governor palin said to joe biden that our plan to get our economi out of the ditch wa somehow a job kill plan __PUNCT__
i wonder if she turn on the new thi morn __PUNCT__
becaus it wa just report that america ha experienc it ninth straight month of job loss __PUNCT__
just sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we lost more than __NUM__ job across america __PUNCT__ __NUM__ in pennsylvania alon __PUNCT__
thi is the economi that john mccain said __PUNCT__ just two week ago __PUNCT__ wa fundament strong __PUNCT__
thi is the economi that my oppon said made great progress under the polici of georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
and those ar the econom polici that he propos to continu for anoth four year __PUNCT__
so when senat mccain and hi run mate talk about job kill __PUNCT__ that someth thei know a thing or two about __PUNCT__
becaus the polici thei support ar kill job everi singl dai __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ abington __PUNCT__ i am here to tell you that we cannot afford four more year of thi __PUNCT__
becaus where i come from __PUNCT__ there noth more fundament than have the sens of mean and purpos that come with show up at work in the morn __PUNCT__
there noth more fundament than be abl to put your kid through colleg __PUNCT__ or have health care when you get sick __PUNCT__ or be abl to retir with secur __PUNCT__
there noth more fundament than a good pai job __PUNCT__
that why we here todai __PUNCT__ becaus we need to do what we did in the 1990 and creat million of new job and not lose them __PUNCT__
we need to do what we did in the 1990 and make sure peopl incom ar go up and not down __PUNCT__
we need to do what a gui name bill clinton did in the 1990 and put peopl first again __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we tri it their wai __PUNCT__
it hasn't work __PUNCT__
and it won't work now __PUNCT__
but let me tell you what will work __PUNCT__
what will work is invest __MONEY__ billion a year over the next decad in renew sourc of energi like wind and solar __PUNCT__ an invest that will gener five million new job that pai well and can't ever be outsourc __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we can end our depend on foreign oil in the process __PUNCT__ and noth will help our economi more than that __PUNCT__
what will work is make an invest in rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__
that will mean job for two million more american __PUNCT__
my oppon support give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
but what will work is give those tax break to compani that creat job here at home __PUNCT__
my oppon support tax haven that let compani avoid pai tax here in america __PUNCT__ tax haven that cost __MONEY__ billion everi year __PUNCT__
but what will work is shut those tax haven and close corpor loophol __PUNCT__
what will work is give tax break to the small busi that ar the engin of econom growth in thi countri __PUNCT__ and cut tax __PUNCT__ hear me now __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ percent of all work famili __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
that what will work __PUNCT__
and that the kind of chang joe biden and i ar go to bring to washington __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me be perfectli clear __PUNCT__
the fact that our economi is in thi mess is an outrag __PUNCT__
it an outrag becaus we did not get here by accid __PUNCT__
thi wa not a normal part of the busi cycl __PUNCT__
thi did not happen becaus of a few bad appl __PUNCT__
thi financi crisi is a direct result of the greed and irrespons that ha domin washington and wall street for year __PUNCT__
it the result of an econom philosophi that sai we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__ a philosophi that view even the most common __PUNCT__ sens regul as unwis and unnecessari __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thi crisi is noth less than a final verdict on thi fail philosophi __PUNCT__ and it a philosophi that will end when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
becaus despit my oppon best effort to make you think otherwis __PUNCT__ thi is the philosophi he embrac dure hi twenti __PUNCT__ six year in washington __PUNCT__
and it show just how out of touch he realli is __PUNCT__
how els could he offer __MONEY__ billion in tax cut for big corpor at a time like thi __PUNCT__ how els could he propos give the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo a __MONEY__ tax cut at a time when million of american ar struggl to pai their bill __PUNCT__ how els could he come up with an econom plan that leav out more than __NUM__ million middl class taxpay __PUNCT__
senat mccain just doesn't get it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ abington __PUNCT__ i do get it __PUNCT__
and i think all of you get it too __PUNCT__
we know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
we know how bad pennsylvania ha been hurt __PUNCT__
but here what i also know __PUNCT__ i know we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus that who we ar __PUNCT__
becaus that what american do __PUNCT__
thi is a nation that face tougher time than these __PUNCT__ we face war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we risen to meet these challeng becaus we never forgotten that fundament truth __PUNCT__ that here __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ it written by us __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ the futur is our to shape __PUNCT__
that what we need to do right now __PUNCT__
part of what that mean is pass the rescu plan that befor congress __PUNCT__
thi is a plan that will help us deal with thi immedi crisi and put our economi on a firmer foot __PUNCT__
it a plan i vote for the other night __PUNCT__ becaus i made sure it includ taxpay protect and wasn't simpli a blank check like thi administr initi ask for __PUNCT__
and it a plan that the hous is go to be vote on soon __PUNCT__
so to democrat and republican in the hous who ar now on the fenc __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__ do not make the same mistak twice __PUNCT__
for the sake of our famili __PUNCT__ our economi __PUNCT__ and our countri __PUNCT__ step up to the plate and pass thi plan __PUNCT__
but understand __PUNCT__ even with thi plan __PUNCT__ we mai face a long and difficult road to recoveri __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ if i presid __PUNCT__ pass thi rescu plan won't be the end of what we do to strengthen our economi __PUNCT__ it be the begin __PUNCT__
it be the begin of a long __PUNCT__ term rescu plan for our middl class __PUNCT__ a plan that will put opportun within reach for anyon who will to fight for it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some peopl have ask whether our weaken economi mean the next presid will have to scale back hi agenda __PUNCT__
but i reject the idea that you can't build a strong middl class at a time when our economi is weak __PUNCT__
becaus i got a differ econom philosophi than john mccain __PUNCT__ i believ that build a strong middl class is the kei to make our economi strong __PUNCT__
and that what we do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so ye __PUNCT__ we creat million of new job __PUNCT__ and ye __PUNCT__ we put more monei back into the pocket of hardwork famili __PUNCT__
but we also do someth more __PUNCT__
we will reform our health care system so we can reliev famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and our economi from the crush cost of health care by invest in new technolog and prevent care __PUNCT__
if you have health care __PUNCT__ my plan will lower your premium __PUNCT__
if you don't __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and we go to stand up to the insur compani __PUNCT__
thi is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di when she wa __NUM__ from ovarian cancer __PUNCT__ and you know what she wa do in her final month __PUNCT__ she wa in her hospit bed argu with insur compani about whether or not it wa a preexist condit __PUNCT__
so i know the pain that caus by our broken health care system __PUNCT__
and that why as presid __PUNCT__ i will stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care the most __PUNCT__
and anoth thing we know will work in the long term is to make sure that our educ system is second to none so that everi child in america ha the skill thei need to compet for high wage job in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
i laid out a comprehens plan to get there that will give our kid the opportun thei deserv __PUNCT__
when i spoke about that plan a while back __PUNCT__ senat mccain top educ advisor said that thi isn't an issu he been focus on __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ if you want to creat job and grow thi economi in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ you had better focu on educ __PUNCT__
becaus we know that countri that out __PUNCT__ teach us todai will outcompet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i will modern our outdat financi regul and put in place the common __PUNCT__ sens rule of the road i been call for sinc march __PUNCT__ rule that will keep our market free __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and honest __PUNCT__ rule that will restor account and respons in the boardroom __PUNCT__ and make sure wall street can never get awai with the stunt that caus thi crisi again __PUNCT__
but just as we demand account on wall street __PUNCT__ we must also demand it in washington __PUNCT__
that why i not go to stand here and simpli tell you what i go to spend __PUNCT__ i go to tell you how we go to save when i am presid __PUNCT__
i do what you do in your own famili budget and make sure we spend monei wise __PUNCT__
i will go through the entir feder budget __PUNCT__ page by page __PUNCT__ line by line __PUNCT__ and elimin program that don't work and aren't need __PUNCT__
we start by end a war in iraq that cost __MONEY__ billion a month while the iraqi govern sit on a __MONEY__ billion surplu __PUNCT__
and we save billion more by cut wast __PUNCT__ improv manag __PUNCT__ and strengthen oversight __PUNCT__
these ar the chang and reform we need __PUNCT__
a new era of respons and account on wall street and in washington __PUNCT__
common __PUNCT__ sens regul to prevent a crisi like thi from ever happen again __PUNCT__
invest in the technolog and innov that will restor prosper and lead to new job and a new economi for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
bottom __PUNCT__ up growth that give everi american a fair shot at the american dream __PUNCT__
i won't pretend thi will be easi or come without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
what thi crisi ha taught us is that at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ there is no real separ between main street and wall street __PUNCT__
there is onli the road we travel on as american __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall on that journei as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow our own petti differ and broken polit to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
