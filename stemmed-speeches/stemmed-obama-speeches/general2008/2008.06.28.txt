naleo close statement
you know __PUNCT__ a few year ago __PUNCT__ i attend a natur workshop at st __PUNCT__ piu church in chicago __PUNCT__
and as i walk down the aisl __PUNCT__ i saw peopl clutch small american flag __PUNCT__ wait for their turn to be call up so thei could begin the long process to becom u. __PUNCT__ citizen __PUNCT__
and at on point __PUNCT__ a young girl __PUNCT__ seven or eight __PUNCT__ came up to me with her parent __PUNCT__ and ask for my autograph __PUNCT__
she said she wa studi govern in school and want to show it to her third grade class __PUNCT__
i ask her what her name wa __PUNCT__ and she said her name wa cristina __PUNCT__
i told her parent thei should be veri proud of her __PUNCT__
and as i watch cristina translat my word into spanish for them __PUNCT__ i wa remind that for all the nois and anger that too often surround the immigr debat __PUNCT__ america ha noth to fear from todai immigr __PUNCT__
thei have come here for the same reason that famili have alwai come here __PUNCT__ for the same reason my father came here __PUNCT__ for the hope that in america __PUNCT__ thei could build a better life for themselv and their famili __PUNCT__
like the wave of immigr that came befor them and the hispan american like ken salazar whose famili have been here for gener __PUNCT__ the recent arriv of latino immigr will onli enrich our countri __PUNCT__
ultim __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ the danger to the american wai of life is not that we will be overrun by those who do not look like us or do not yet speak our languag __PUNCT__
the danger will come if we fail to recogn the human of cristina and her famili __PUNCT__ if we withhold from them the opportun we take for grant __PUNCT__ and creat a servant class in our midst __PUNCT__
more broadli __PUNCT__ the danger will come if we continu to stand idli by as the gap between wall street and main street grow __PUNCT__ as washington grow more out of touch __PUNCT__ and as america grow more unequ __PUNCT__
becaus america can onli prosper when all american prosper __PUNCT__ brown __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ and nativ american __PUNCT__
that the idea that li at the heart of my campaign __PUNCT__ and that the idea that will lie at the heart of my presid __PUNCT__
