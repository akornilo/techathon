it time for us to recogn that these individu stori connect to a larger american stori __PUNCT__
all of us have a stake in our common prosper __PUNCT__
when folk ar struggl out on main street __PUNCT__ that pain is go to trickl up to wall street __PUNCT__
and just as we must provid relief to american who ar struggl __PUNCT__ we also have to recogn that we fail to put ourselv in a posit to compet in the global economi __PUNCT__
our countri face new challeng to our leadership in thi young centuri __PUNCT__
our kid will grow up face competit from their counterpart in beij and bangalor __PUNCT__
if we don't chang cours __PUNCT__ there no guarante that the american dream will be there for my daughter __PUNCT__ or your son __PUNCT__ as it wa there for us __PUNCT__
america risk fall behind __PUNCT__
if we remain depend on oil from dictat __PUNCT__ we endang our secur __PUNCT__ imperil our planet __PUNCT__ pai more at the pump __PUNCT__ and sit on the sidelin while the job of the futur ar creat abroad __PUNCT__
if we can't give everi child in america the chanc to get a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ we crippl their abil to make a live in a knowledg __PUNCT__ base economi __PUNCT__ and watch china and india move ahead in the race for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
if we can't control skyrocket health care cost __PUNCT__ we confront a mount moral crisi __PUNCT__ and a major anchor on the abil of american busi to compet __PUNCT__
if we don't rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ rail bridg and electr grid __PUNCT__ we see our standard of live suffer __PUNCT__ while we leav our commun less safe from terror or natur disast __PUNCT__
and if we don't invest in and encourag innov __PUNCT__ we could cede america histor role as the engin of growth __PUNCT__ and progress __PUNCT__ and discoveri for the entir world __PUNCT__
these challeng ar real __PUNCT__
how we deal with them will shape the prosper of everi singl american __PUNCT__ and the futur of america leadership in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it fall to us to look at these problem __PUNCT__ and to see the possibl embed within them __PUNCT__

my oppon in thi campaign ha serv thi countri with honor __PUNCT__ and i look forward to debat him on these issu __PUNCT__
becaus we have a veri differ view of the choic that america need to make __PUNCT__
he ha support and would continu __PUNCT__ an agenda that ha fail to keep pace with the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
i believ we must move in a new direct __PUNCT__
if we have the courag to commit to chang __PUNCT__ the american peopl can not just seiz __PUNCT__ but shape __PUNCT__ the opportun of the global economi __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can author our own stori __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can pursu a __NUM__ centuri leadership agenda that focus on five area __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ infrastructur __PUNCT__ and innov __PUNCT__
success will not come from washington __PUNCT__ it must come from the dynam __PUNCT__ determin and ingenu of the american peopl __PUNCT__ through new partnership between state and citi __PUNCT__ the public and privat sector __PUNCT__ and through the activ involv of the american peopl __PUNCT__
but we also know that for our countri to succe __PUNCT__ washington ha to chang __PUNCT__
becaus at moment of great econom transform __PUNCT__ govern must serv as a catalyst for chang __PUNCT__ to leverag all of the sector of american societi that ar repres here todai __PUNCT__
thi can be the moment when we make a truli nation effort to end our addict to oil __PUNCT__
just as roosevelt invest in an arsen of democraci and kennedi took us to the moon __PUNCT__ we can be the gener that achiev energi secur __PUNCT__ grow our economi __PUNCT__ and save our planet __PUNCT__
american presid have been call for thi kind of effort sinc nixon __PUNCT__
but now is the time to act __PUNCT__
we could have made that choic in __NUM__ but instead we got secret task forc and greater energi depend __PUNCT__
and we watch as countri like brazil and germani have creat hundr of thousand of job __PUNCT__
we have fail to act __PUNCT__ and we fallen behind __PUNCT__
i propos invest __MONEY__ billion in a green energi sector to creat five million new job __PUNCT__ good job that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
but thi must mere be a spark for american industri and innov to develop altern to oil and ga __PUNCT__ and to creat a new energi economi __PUNCT__
if we do thi __PUNCT__ the great assembl line manufactur of the __NUM__ centuri can turn out car that run on renew energi __PUNCT__
the dictat who hold our secur hostag will see their leverag disappear along with their revenu __PUNCT__
the ocean will no longer rise __PUNCT__ and our planet will be preserv __PUNCT__
that what we must do as a centerpiec of our competit strategi as a nation __PUNCT__
thi can be the moment when we make an histor commit to educ __PUNCT__
becaus we cannot be satisfi until everi child in america __PUNCT__ and i mean everi child __PUNCT__ ha the same chanc to get a world __PUNCT__ class educ that we want for our own children __PUNCT__
we need to commit __MONEY__ billion to give everi child access to qualiti __PUNCT__ earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
but we also need a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ state strategi that reach down to the grassroot __PUNCT__
to have success school __PUNCT__ we need to recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and provid them with better pai and more support __PUNCT__ but we also have to develop new curricula and renew account __PUNCT__
to lift up our children __PUNCT__ we need a nation commit __PUNCT__ but we also need parent to get up off the couch __PUNCT__ turn off the tv __PUNCT__ and to read to their children __PUNCT__
and to educ the best workforc in the world __PUNCT__ a colleg educ should be the birthright of everi american __PUNCT__ but we also have to ask our young peopl to invest in america through servic __PUNCT__ and we should work with our commun colleg to provid new skill and lifelong learn __PUNCT__
that what we must do to extend the american dream __PUNCT__
thi can be the moment when we final come togeth to make health care afford and access for everi singl american __PUNCT__ and lower cost for all american famili __PUNCT__

that what we must do here in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
washington can seed thi effort __PUNCT__
that why i propos put __MONEY__ billion into a nation infrastructur reinvest bank to rebuild our road and bridg __PUNCT__ our rail and port __PUNCT__
thi must leverag the kind of privat invest that can creat million of job and remak our commun __PUNCT__

that what we must do to make sure that america run on a strong __PUNCT__ fair and effici foundat __PUNCT__
and thi can be the moment when we invest in the scienc and innov that will shape our futur __PUNCT__
becaus in a technolog __PUNCT__ driven economi __PUNCT__ america must alwai stai on the cut edg __PUNCT__
that mean revers a trend where we devot a smaller and smaller share of our nation resourc to research and develop __PUNCT__
an innov agenda must commit to fund basic research and make the r&d tax credit perman __PUNCT__
it must also exempt start __PUNCT__ up from capit gain tax __PUNCT__ and remov bureaucrat barrier to entrepreneur __PUNCT__ for instanc __PUNCT__ by make our patent process more effici and reliabl __PUNCT__
we need the discoveri of tomorrow to be made in our lab and univers __PUNCT__ at pitt and carnegi mellon __PUNCT__

becaus in citi and town across america __PUNCT__ i know that the american peopl ar readi to rise to the challeng of a new moment __PUNCT__ thei just haven't been ask __PUNCT__
it time for that to chang __PUNCT__
becaus there is noth that american can't do when we choos to rise togeth __PUNCT__
for two hundr and fifti year __PUNCT__ that is what ha been done here in pittsburgh __PUNCT__
thi is where u. __PUNCT__ steel becam the first billion dollar corpor __PUNCT__ and turn out more steel at the dawn of the cold war than the entir soviet union __PUNCT__
and just as that output built our citi and laid down the rail that connect them __PUNCT__ the work that creat that wealth wa the foundat of a middl class where each gener opportun could extend a littl further __PUNCT__ and each individu stori could advanc the larger american stori __PUNCT__
mani of the steel mill ar gone __PUNCT__
