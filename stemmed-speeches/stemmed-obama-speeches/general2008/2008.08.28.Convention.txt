it is that promis that ha alwai set thi countri apart __PUNCT__ that through hard work and sacrific __PUNCT__ each of us can pursu our individu dream but still come togeth as on american famili __PUNCT__ to ensur that the next gener can pursu their dream as well __PUNCT__

we meet at on of those defin moment __PUNCT__ a moment when our nation is at war __PUNCT__ our economi is in turmoil __PUNCT__ and the american promis ha been threaten onc more __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ more american ar out of work and more ar work harder for less __PUNCT__
more of you have lost your home and even more ar watch your home valu plummet __PUNCT__
more of you have car you can't afford to drive __PUNCT__ credit card bill you can't afford to pai __PUNCT__ and tuition that beyond your reach __PUNCT__
these challeng ar not all of govern make __PUNCT__
but the failur to respond is a direct result of a broken polit in washington and the fail polici of georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ we ar better than these last eight year __PUNCT__
we ar a better countri than thi __PUNCT__
thi countri is more decent than on where a woman in ohio __PUNCT__ on the brink of retir __PUNCT__ find herself on ill awai from disast after a lifetim of hard work __PUNCT__
thi countri is more gener than on where a man in indiana ha to pack up the equip he work on for twenti year and watch it ship off to china __PUNCT__ and then choke up as he explain how he felt like a failur when he went home to tell hi famili the new __PUNCT__
we ar more compassion than a govern that let veteran sleep on our street and famili slide into poverti __PUNCT__ that sit on it hand while a major american citi drown befor our ey __PUNCT__
tonight __PUNCT__ i sai to the american peopl __PUNCT__ to democrat and republican and independ across thi great land __PUNCT__ enough __PUNCT__ thi moment __PUNCT__ thi elect __PUNCT__ is our chanc to keep __PUNCT__ in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ the american promis aliv __PUNCT__
becaus next week __PUNCT__ in minnesota __PUNCT__ the same parti that brought you two term of georg bush and dick chenei will ask thi countri for a third __PUNCT__
and we ar here becaus we love thi countri too much to let the next four year look like the last eight __PUNCT__
on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we must stand up and sai __PUNCT__ eight is enough __PUNCT__
now let there be no doubt __PUNCT__
the republican nomine __PUNCT__ john mccain __PUNCT__ ha worn the uniform of our countri with braveri and distinct __PUNCT__ and for that we ow him our gratitud and respect __PUNCT__
and next week __PUNCT__ we also hear about those occas when he broken with hi parti as evid that he can deliv the chang that we need __PUNCT__
but the record clear __PUNCT__ john mccain ha vote with georg bush nineti percent of the time __PUNCT__
senat mccain like to talk about judgment __PUNCT__ but realli __PUNCT__ what doe it sai about your judgment when you think georg bush ha been right more than nineti percent of the time __PUNCT__ i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but i not readi to take a ten percent chanc on chang __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ on issu after issu that would make a differ in your live __PUNCT__ on health care and educ and the economi __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha been anyth but independ __PUNCT__
he said that our economi ha made __PUNCT__ great progress __PUNCT__ under thi presid __PUNCT__
he said that the fundament of the economi ar strong __PUNCT__
and when on of hi chief advisor __PUNCT__ the man who wrote hi econom plan __PUNCT__ wa talk about the anxieti american ar feel __PUNCT__ he said that we were just suffer from a __PUNCT__ mental recess __PUNCT__ and that we becom __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ a nation of whiner __PUNCT__
a nation of whiner __PUNCT__ tell that to the proud auto worker at a michigan plant who __PUNCT__ after thei found out it wa close __PUNCT__ kept show up everi dai and work as hard as ever __PUNCT__ becaus thei knew there were peopl who count on the brake that thei made __PUNCT__
tell that to the militari famili who shoulder their burden silent as thei watch their love on leav for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duti __PUNCT__
these ar not whiner __PUNCT__
thei work hard and give back and keep go without complaint __PUNCT__
these ar the american that i know __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't believ that senat mccain doesn't care what go on in the live of american __PUNCT__
i just think he doesn't know __PUNCT__
why els would he defin middl __PUNCT__ class as someon make under five million dollar a year __PUNCT__ how els could he propos hundr of billion in tax break for big corpor and oil compani but not on penni of tax relief to more than on hundr million american __PUNCT__ how els could he offer a health care plan that would actual tax peopl benefit __PUNCT__ or an educ plan that would do noth to help famili pai for colleg __PUNCT__ or a plan that would privat social secur and gambl your retir __PUNCT__
it not becaus john mccain doesn't care __PUNCT__
it becaus john mccain doesn't get it __PUNCT__
for over two decad __PUNCT__ he subscrib to that old __PUNCT__ discredit republican philosophi __PUNCT__ give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ thei call thi the ownership societi __PUNCT__ but what it realli mean is __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
out of work __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__
no health care __PUNCT__ the market will fix it __PUNCT__
born into poverti __PUNCT__ pull yourself up by your own bootstrap __PUNCT__ even if you don't have boot __PUNCT__
you on your own __PUNCT__
well it time for them to own their failur __PUNCT__
it time for us to chang america __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ we democrat have a veri differ measur of what constitut progress in thi countri __PUNCT__
we measur progress by how mani peopl can find a job that pai the mortgag __PUNCT__ whether you can put a littl extra monei awai at the end of each month so you can somedai watch your child receiv her colleg diploma __PUNCT__
we measur progress in the __NUM__ million new job that were creat when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ when the averag american famili saw it incom go up __MONEY__ instead of down __MONEY__ like it ha under georg bush __PUNCT__
we measur the strength of our economi not by the number of billionair we have or the profit of the fortun __NUM__ but by whether someon with a good idea can take a risk and start a new busi __PUNCT__ or whether the waitress who live on tip can take a dai off to look after a sick kid without lose her job __PUNCT__ an economi that honor the digniti of work __PUNCT__
the fundament we us to measur econom strength ar whether we ar live up to that fundament promis that ha made thi countri great __PUNCT__ a promis that is the onli reason i am stand here tonight __PUNCT__
becaus in the face of those young veteran who come back from iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ i see my grandfath __PUNCT__ who sign up after pearl harbor __PUNCT__ march in patton armi __PUNCT__ and wa reward by a grate nation with the chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
in the face of that young student who sleep just three hour befor work the night shift __PUNCT__ i think about my mom __PUNCT__ who rais my sister and me on her own while she work and earn her degre __PUNCT__ who onc turn to food stamp but wa still abl to send us to the best school in the countri with the help of student loan and scholarship __PUNCT__
when i listen to anoth worker tell me that hi factori ha shut down __PUNCT__ i rememb all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decad ago after the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulti of start her own busi __PUNCT__ i think about my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who work her wai up from the secretari pool to middl __PUNCT__ manag __PUNCT__ despit year of be pass over for promot becaus she wa a woman __PUNCT__
she the on who taught me about hard work __PUNCT__
she the on who put off bui a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life __PUNCT__
she pour everyth she had into me __PUNCT__
and although she can no longer travel __PUNCT__ i know that she watch tonight __PUNCT__ and that tonight is her night as well __PUNCT__
i don't know what kind of live john mccain think that celebr lead __PUNCT__ but thi ha been mine __PUNCT__
these ar my hero __PUNCT__
their ar the stori that shape me __PUNCT__
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win thi elect and keep our promis aliv as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
what is that promis __PUNCT__
it a promis that sai each of us ha the freedom to make of our own live what we will __PUNCT__ but that we also have the oblig to treat each other with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
it a promis that sai the market should reward drive and innov and gener growth __PUNCT__ but that busi should live up to their respons to creat american job __PUNCT__ look out for american worker __PUNCT__ and plai by the rule of the road __PUNCT__
our is a promis that sai govern cannot solv all our problem __PUNCT__ but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselv __PUNCT__ protect us from harm and provid everi child a decent educ __PUNCT__ keep our water clean and our toi safe __PUNCT__ invest in new school and new road and new scienc and technolog __PUNCT__
our govern should work for us __PUNCT__ not against us __PUNCT__
it should help us __PUNCT__ not hurt us __PUNCT__
it should ensur opportun not just for those with the most monei and influenc __PUNCT__ but for everi american who will to work __PUNCT__
that the promis of america __PUNCT__ the idea that we ar respons for ourselv __PUNCT__ but that we also rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ the fundament belief that i am my brother keeper __PUNCT__ i am my sister keeper __PUNCT__
that the promis we need to keep __PUNCT__
that the chang we need right now __PUNCT__
so let me spell out exactli what that chang would mean if i am presid __PUNCT__
chang mean a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyist who wrote it __PUNCT__ but the american worker and small busi who deserv it __PUNCT__
unlik john mccain __PUNCT__ i will stop give tax break to corpor that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and i will start give them to compani that creat good job right here in america __PUNCT__
i will elimin capit gain tax for the small busi and the start __PUNCT__ up that will creat the high __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
i will cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all work famili __PUNCT__
becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
and for the sake of our economi __PUNCT__ our secur __PUNCT__ and the futur of our planet __PUNCT__ i will set a clear goal as presid __PUNCT__ in ten year __PUNCT__ we will final end our depend on oil from the middl east __PUNCT__
washington been talk about our oil addict for the last thirti year __PUNCT__ and john mccain ha been there for twenti __PUNCT__ six of them __PUNCT__
in that time __PUNCT__ he said no to higher fuel __PUNCT__ effici standard for car __PUNCT__ no to invest in renew energi __PUNCT__ no to renew fuel __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ we import tripl the amount of oil as the dai that senat mccain took offic __PUNCT__
now is the time to end thi addict __PUNCT__ and to understand that drill is a stop __PUNCT__ gap measur __PUNCT__ not a long __PUNCT__ term solut __PUNCT__
not even close __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will tap our natur ga reserv __PUNCT__ invest in clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ and find wai to safe har nuclear power __PUNCT__
i help our auto compani re __PUNCT__ tool __PUNCT__ so that the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of the futur ar built right here in america __PUNCT__
i make it easier for the american peopl to afford these new car __PUNCT__
and i invest __NUM__ billion dollar over the next decad in afford __PUNCT__ renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__ wind power and solar power and the next gener of biofuel __PUNCT__ an invest that will lead to new industri and five million new job that pai well and can't ever be outsourc __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ now is not the time for small plan __PUNCT__
now is the time to final meet our moral oblig to provid everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ becaus it will take noth less to compet in the global economi __PUNCT__
michel and i ar onli here tonight becaus we were given a chanc at an educ __PUNCT__
and i will not settl for an america where some kid don't have that chanc __PUNCT__
i invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
i recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them higher salari and give them more support __PUNCT__
and in exchang __PUNCT__ i ask for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and we will keep our promis to everi young american __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__
now is the time to final keep the promis of afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
if you have health care __PUNCT__ my plan will lower your premium __PUNCT__
if you don't __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and as someon who watch my mother argu with insur compani while she lai in bed dy of cancer __PUNCT__ i will make certain those compani stop discrimin against those who ar sick and need care the most __PUNCT__
now is the time to help famili with paid sick dai and better famili leav __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi in america should have to choos between keep their job and care for a sick child or ail parent __PUNCT__
now is the time to chang our bankruptci law __PUNCT__ so that your pension ar protect ahead of ceo bonus __PUNCT__ and the time to protect social secur for futur gener __PUNCT__
and now is the time to keep the promis of equal pai for an equal dai work __PUNCT__ becaus i want my daughter to have exactli the same opportun as your son __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mani of these plan will cost monei __PUNCT__ which is why i laid out how i pai for everi dime __PUNCT__ by close corpor loophol and tax haven that don't help america grow __PUNCT__
but i will also go through the feder budget __PUNCT__ line by line __PUNCT__ elimin program that no longer work and make the on we do need work better and cost less __PUNCT__ becaus we cannot meet twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri challeng with a twentieth centuri bureaucraci __PUNCT__
and democrat __PUNCT__ we must also admit that fulfil america promis will requir more than just monei __PUNCT__
it will requir a renew sens of respons from each of us to recov what john f __PUNCT__ kennedi call our __PUNCT__ intellectu and moral strength __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ govern must lead on energi independ __PUNCT__ but each of us must do our part to make our home and busi more effici __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we must provid more ladder to success for young men who fall into live of crime and despair __PUNCT__
but we must also admit that program alon can't replac parent __PUNCT__ that govern can't turn off the televis and make a child do her homework __PUNCT__ that father must take more respons for provid the love and guidanc their children need __PUNCT__
individu respons and mutual respons __PUNCT__ that the essenc of america promis __PUNCT__
and just as we keep our keep our promis to the next gener here at home __PUNCT__ so must we keep america promis abroad __PUNCT__
if john mccain want to have a debat about who ha the tempera __PUNCT__ and judgment __PUNCT__ to serv as the next command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ that a debat i readi to have __PUNCT__
for while senat mccain wa turn hi sight to iraq just dai after 9/11 __PUNCT__ i stood up and oppos thi war __PUNCT__ know that it would distract us from the real threat we face __PUNCT__
when john mccain said we could just __PUNCT__ muddl through __PUNCT__ in afghanistan __PUNCT__ i argu for more resourc and more troop to finish the fight against the terrorist who actual attack us on 9/11 __PUNCT__ and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and hi lieuten if we have them in our sight __PUNCT__
john mccain like to sai that he follow bin laden to the gate of hell __PUNCT__ but he won't even go to the cave where he live __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ as my call for a time frame to remov our troop from iraq ha been echo by the iraqi govern and even the bush administr __PUNCT__ even after we learn that iraq ha a __MONEY__ billion surplu while we wallow in deficit __PUNCT__ john mccain stand alon in hi stubborn refus to end a misguid war __PUNCT__
that not the judgment we need __PUNCT__
that won't keep america safe __PUNCT__
we need a presid who can face the threat of the futur __PUNCT__ not keep grasp at the idea of the past __PUNCT__
you don't defeat a terrorist network that oper in eighti countri by occupi iraq __PUNCT__
you don't protect israel and deter iran just by talk tough in washington __PUNCT__
you can't truli stand up for georgia when you strain our oldest allianc __PUNCT__
if john mccain want to follow georg bush with more tough talk and bad strategi __PUNCT__ that is hi choic __PUNCT__ but it is not the chang we need __PUNCT__
we ar the parti of roosevelt __PUNCT__
we ar the parti of kennedi __PUNCT__
so don't tell me that democrat won't defend thi countri __PUNCT__
don't tell me that democrat won't keep us safe __PUNCT__
the bush __PUNCT__ mccain foreign polici ha squander the legaci that gener of american __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ have built __PUNCT__ and we ar here to restor that legaci __PUNCT__
as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ i will never hesit to defend thi nation __PUNCT__ but i will onli send our troop into harm wai with a clear mission and a sacr commit to give them the equip thei need in battl and the care and benefit thei deserv when thei come home __PUNCT__
i will end thi war in iraq respons __PUNCT__ and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i will rebuild our militari to meet futur conflict __PUNCT__
but i will also renew the tough __PUNCT__ direct diplomaci that can prevent iran from obtain nuclear weapon and curb russian aggress __PUNCT__
i will build new partnership to defeat the threat of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ terror and nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ poverti and genocid __PUNCT__ climat chang and diseas __PUNCT__
and i will restor our moral stand __PUNCT__ so that america is onc again that last __PUNCT__ best hope for all who ar call to the caus of freedom __PUNCT__ who long for live of peac __PUNCT__ and who yearn for a better futur __PUNCT__
these ar the polici i will pursu __PUNCT__
and in the week ahead __PUNCT__ i look forward to debat them with john mccain __PUNCT__
but what i will not do is suggest that the senat take hi posit for polit purpos __PUNCT__
becaus on of the thing that we have to chang in our polit is the idea that peopl cannot disagre without challeng each other charact and patriot __PUNCT__
the time ar too seriou __PUNCT__ the stake ar too high for thi same partisan playbook __PUNCT__
so let us agre that patriot ha no parti __PUNCT__
i love thi countri __PUNCT__ and so do you __PUNCT__ and so doe john mccain __PUNCT__
the men and women who serv in our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so i got new for you __PUNCT__ john mccain __PUNCT__
we all put our countri first __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ our work will not be easi __PUNCT__
the challeng we face requir tough choic __PUNCT__ and democrat as well as republican will need to cast off the worn __PUNCT__ out idea and polit of the past __PUNCT__
for part of what ha been lost these past eight year can't just be measur by lost wage or bigger trade deficit __PUNCT__
what ha also been lost is our sens of common purpos __PUNCT__ our sens of higher purpos __PUNCT__
and that what we have to restor __PUNCT__
we mai not agre on abort __PUNCT__ but sure we can agre on reduc the number of unwant pregnanc in thi countri __PUNCT__
the realiti of gun ownership mai be differ for hunter in rural ohio than for those plagu by gang __PUNCT__ violenc in cleveland __PUNCT__ but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amend while keep ak __PUNCT__ 47 out of the hand of crimin __PUNCT__
i know there ar differ on same __PUNCT__ sex marriag __PUNCT__ but sure we can agre that our gai and lesbian brother and sister deserv to visit the person thei love in the hospit and to live live free of discrimin __PUNCT__
passion fly on immigr __PUNCT__ but i don't know anyon who benefit when a mother is separ from her infant child or an employ undercut american wage by hire illeg worker __PUNCT__
thi too is part of america promis __PUNCT__ the promis of a democraci where we can find the strength and grace to bridg divid and unit in common effort __PUNCT__
i know there ar those who dismiss such belief as happi talk __PUNCT__
thei claim that our insist on someth larger __PUNCT__ someth firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan hors for higher tax and the abandon of tradit valu __PUNCT__
and that to be expect __PUNCT__
becaus if you don't have ani fresh idea __PUNCT__ then you us stale tactic to scare the voter __PUNCT__
if you don't have a record to run on __PUNCT__ then you paint your oppon as someon peopl should run from __PUNCT__
you make a big elect about small thing __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ it work befor __PUNCT__
becaus it feed into the cynic we all have about govern __PUNCT__
when washington doesn't work __PUNCT__ all it promis seem empti __PUNCT__
if your hope have been dash again and again __PUNCT__ then it best to stop hope __PUNCT__ and settl for what you alreadi know __PUNCT__
i get it __PUNCT__
i realiz that i am not the likeliest candid for thi offic __PUNCT__
i don't fit the typic pedigre __PUNCT__ and i haven't spent my career in the hall of washington __PUNCT__
but i stand befor you tonight becaus all across america someth is stir __PUNCT__
what the nai __PUNCT__ sayer don't understand is that thi elect ha never been about me __PUNCT__
it been about you __PUNCT__
for eighteen long month __PUNCT__ you have stood up __PUNCT__ on by on __PUNCT__ and said enough to the polit of the past __PUNCT__
you understand that in thi elect __PUNCT__ the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old polit with the same old player and expect a differ result __PUNCT__
you have shown what histori teach us __PUNCT__ that at defin moment like thi on __PUNCT__ the chang we need doesn't come from washington __PUNCT__
chang come to washington __PUNCT__
chang happen becaus the american peopl demand it __PUNCT__ becaus thei rise up and insist on new idea and new leadership __PUNCT__ a new polit for a new time __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i believ that as hard as it will be __PUNCT__ the chang we need is come __PUNCT__
becaus i seen it __PUNCT__
becaus i live it __PUNCT__
i seen it in illinoi __PUNCT__ when we provid health care to more children and move more famili from welfar to work __PUNCT__
i seen it in washington __PUNCT__ when we work across parti line to open up govern and hold lobbyist more account __PUNCT__ to give better care for our veteran and keep nuclear weapon out of terrorist hand __PUNCT__
and i seen it in thi campaign __PUNCT__
in the young peopl who vote for the first time __PUNCT__ and in those who got involv again after a veri long time __PUNCT__
in the republican who never thought thei pick up a democrat ballot __PUNCT__ but did __PUNCT__
i seen it in the worker who would rather cut their hour back a dai than see their friend lose their job __PUNCT__ in the soldier who re __PUNCT__ enlist after lose a limb __PUNCT__ in the good neighbor who take a stranger in when a hurrican strike and the floodwat rise __PUNCT__
thi countri of our ha more wealth than ani nation __PUNCT__ but that not what make us rich __PUNCT__
we have the most power militari on earth __PUNCT__ but that not what make us strong __PUNCT__
our univers and our cultur ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__ but that not what keep the world come to our shore __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ it is that american spirit __PUNCT__ that american promis __PUNCT__ that push us forward even when the path is uncertain __PUNCT__ that bind us togeth in spite of our differ __PUNCT__ that make us fix our ey not on what is seen __PUNCT__ but what is unseen __PUNCT__ that better place around the bend __PUNCT__
that promis is our greatest inherit __PUNCT__
it a promis i make to my daughter when i tuck them in at night __PUNCT__ and a promis that you make to your __PUNCT__ a promis that ha led immigr to cross ocean and pioneer to travel west __PUNCT__ a promis that led worker to picket line __PUNCT__ and women to reach for the ballot __PUNCT__
and it is that promis that forti five year ago todai __PUNCT__ brought american from everi corner of thi land to stand togeth on a mall in washington __PUNCT__ befor lincoln memori __PUNCT__ and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of hi dream __PUNCT__
the men and women who gather there could heard mani thing __PUNCT__
thei could heard word of anger and discord __PUNCT__
thei could been told to succumb to the fear and frustrat of so mani dream defer __PUNCT__
but what the peopl heard instead __PUNCT__ peopl of everi creed and color __PUNCT__ from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ is that in america __PUNCT__ our destini is inextric link __PUNCT__
that togeth __PUNCT__ our dream can be on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we cannot walk alon __PUNCT__ the preacher cri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and as we walk __PUNCT__ we must make the pledg that we shall alwai march ahead __PUNCT__
we cannot turn back __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ we cannot turn back __PUNCT__
not with so much work to be done __PUNCT__
not with so mani children to educ __PUNCT__ and so mani veteran to care for __PUNCT__
not with an economi to fix and citi to rebuild and farm to save __PUNCT__
not with so mani famili to protect and so mani live to mend __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ we cannot turn back __PUNCT__
we cannot walk alon __PUNCT__
at thi moment __PUNCT__ in thi elect __PUNCT__ we must pledg onc more to march into the futur __PUNCT__
let us keep that promis __PUNCT__ that american promis __PUNCT__ and in the word of scriptur hold firmli __PUNCT__ without waver __PUNCT__ to the hope that we confess __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
