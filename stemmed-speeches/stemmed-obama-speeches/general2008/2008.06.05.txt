he know that folk here in southwest virginia should be abl to live their dream without leav their hometown __PUNCT__ and that america need an energi polici that grow our economi __PUNCT__ secur our countri __PUNCT__ and save our planet __PUNCT__
i look forward to campaign with him thi fall __PUNCT__
and as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ i look forward to work with mark warner to bring fundament chang to washington when he join jim webb as the next great senat from the commonwealth of virginia __PUNCT__
i like to sai a few word todai about on of the most import challeng we face in thi countri and on of the biggest issu in thi elect __PUNCT__ our health care crisi __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i been travel across america on thi campaign for __NUM__ month now __PUNCT__ and everywher i gone __PUNCT__ i heard heartbreak stori about our health care system __PUNCT__
there the young woman i met who work the night shift after a full dai of colleg and still can't afford medicin for a sister who ill __PUNCT__ or the man i met who almost lost hi home becaus he ha three children with cystic fibrosi and couldn't pai their health care bill __PUNCT__ who still doesn't have health insur for himself or hi wife and live in fear that a singl ill could cost them everyth __PUNCT__
thi elect is about them __PUNCT__
it about you __PUNCT__
it about everi on of the __NUM__ million american in virginia __PUNCT__ in tennesse and across thi countri __PUNCT__ who ar go without the health care thei need and the million more who ar struggl to pai rise cost __PUNCT__
but let be honest __PUNCT__ we been talk about thi for a long time __PUNCT__
year after year __PUNCT__ elect after elect __PUNCT__ candid make promis about fix health care and cut cost __PUNCT__
and then thei go back to washington __PUNCT__ and noth chang __PUNCT__ becaus the big drug and insur compani write anoth check or becaus lobbyist us their clout to block reform __PUNCT__
and when the next elect roll around __PUNCT__ even more american ar uninsur __PUNCT__ and even more famili ar struggl to pai their medic bill __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we here todai becaus we know that if we go to make real progress __PUNCT__ thi time must be differ __PUNCT__
throughout my career __PUNCT__ in illinoi and the unit state senat __PUNCT__ i work to reduc the power of the special interest by lead the fight for ethic reform __PUNCT__
i sent a strong signal in thi campaign by refus the contribut of regist feder lobbyist and pac __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ i announc that go forward __PUNCT__ the democrat nation committe will uphold the same standard and won't take anoth dime from washington lobbyist or special interest pac __PUNCT__
thei do not fund my campaign __PUNCT__
thei will not fund our parti __PUNCT__
and thei will not drown out the voic of the american peopl when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it time to final challeng the special interest and provid univers health care for all __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ becaus i believ that health care should be guarante for everi american who want it and afford for everi american who need it __PUNCT__
and thi is an area where john mccain and i have a fundament disagr __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i respect john mccain __PUNCT__ and i honor hi servic to thi countri __PUNCT__
my differ with him ar not person __PUNCT__ thei about the polici he propos on thi campaign __PUNCT__ polici that ar no differ than the on that have fail us for the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that start with health care __PUNCT__
we know that sinc georg bush took offic __PUNCT__ premium have gone up four time faster than wage __PUNCT__ and virginia famili ar now pai over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ more for health care __PUNCT__
seven million more american ar uninsur __PUNCT__ includ nearli __NUM__ here in virginia __PUNCT__
yet john mccain actual want to doubl down on the fail polici that have done so littl to help ordinari american __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha a plan that onli take care of the healthi and the wealthi __PUNCT__
instead of offer a comprehens plan to cover all american and control rise cost __PUNCT__ he offer a tax cut that doesn't even amount to half of the cost of an averag famili health care plan __PUNCT__ and won't make health care afford for the hardwork american who need help most __PUNCT__
but it not just that hi plan won't help reduc cost __PUNCT__ it could actual drive cost up __PUNCT__
senat mccain plan would weaken the employ __PUNCT__ base system that most american count on for health care __PUNCT__
it a plan that could subject your coverag to the whim of the market __PUNCT__ gener up to __MONEY__ billion in new administr cost __PUNCT__ and actual put health care cost out of reach for even more older worker __PUNCT__ even more sick american __PUNCT__ and even more famili __PUNCT__
senat mccain campaign ha even acknowledg that hi plan could have the effect of rais tax on some worker __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think the american peopl can afford anoth four year of a health care plan that doe more to help the big drug and insur compani than it doe to lower cost for ordinari american __PUNCT__
we need to make health care afford for everi singl american __PUNCT__ and that what i do as presid __PUNCT__
in an obama administr __PUNCT__ we lower premium by up to __MONEY__ for a typic famili per year __PUNCT__
and we do it by invest in diseas prevent __PUNCT__ not just diseas manag __PUNCT__ by invest in a paperless health care system to reduc administr cost __PUNCT__ and by cover everi singl american and make sure that thei can take their health care with them if thei lose their job __PUNCT__
we also reduc cost for busi and their worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill __PUNCT__
and we won't do all thi twenti year from now __PUNCT__ or ten year from now __PUNCT__
we do it by the end of my first term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so the american peopl will have a clear choic on health care in the fall __PUNCT__
we can either extend the bush polici that we know don't work __PUNCT__ or at thi moment __PUNCT__ in thi elect __PUNCT__ we can come togeth and sai enough is enough __PUNCT__ we go to final solv thi problem onc and for all __PUNCT__
i don't want to wake up mani year from now and see that even more american ar uninsur and even more senior can't afford prescript drug and even more famili ar be driven to financi ruin try to pai their bill becaus we fail to take on the drug and insur compani and provid univers health care __PUNCT__
that not the futur i want for my children __PUNCT__
that not the futur i want for your children __PUNCT__
that not the futur i want for thi countri __PUNCT__
i want to wake up and know that everi singl american ha health care when thei need it __PUNCT__ that everi senior ha prescript drug thei can afford __PUNCT__ and that no parent ar go to bed at night worri about how thei afford medicin for a sick child __PUNCT__
that the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__
that the choic you have thi fall __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
