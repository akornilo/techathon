but so much of what inform my visit come from an experi i had a few year ago at dodg elementari school in chicago __PUNCT__ not far from where you assembl todai __PUNCT__
i ask a young teacher there what she saw as the biggest challeng face her student __PUNCT__
she gave me an answer i had never heard befor __PUNCT__
she talk about what she call __PUNCT__ these kid syndrom __PUNCT__ the tendenc to explain awai the shortcom and failur of our educ system by sai __PUNCT__ these kid can't learn __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ these kid don't want to learn __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ these kid ar just too far behind __PUNCT__
and after a while __PUNCT__ these kid __PUNCT__ becom somebodi els problem __PUNCT__
and she look at me and said __PUNCT__ when i hear that term __PUNCT__ it drive me crazi __PUNCT__
thei not __PUNCT__ these kid __PUNCT__
thei our kid __PUNCT__
all of them __PUNCT__
she absolut right __PUNCT__
these children ar our children __PUNCT__

and it time we understood that their educ is our respons __PUNCT__
i am run for presid to guarante that all of our children have the best possibl chanc in life __PUNCT__
and i am tire of hear you blame for our problem __PUNCT__
i want to lead a new era of mutual respons in educ __PUNCT__ where we all come togeth __PUNCT__ parent and educ __PUNCT__ the aft and leader in washington __PUNCT__ citizen all across america __PUNCT__ unit for the sake of our children success __PUNCT__
bring about that futur begin with fix the broken promis of no child left behind __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i believ that the goal of thi law __PUNCT__ educ everi child with an excel teacher __PUNCT__ close the achiev gap __PUNCT__ ensur more account and higher standard __PUNCT__ were right __PUNCT__
but promis all thi while leav the resourc behind is wrong __PUNCT__
label a school and it student as failur on dai and then abandon them the next is wrong __PUNCT__
we must fix the failur of no child left behind by provid the fund that wa promis __PUNCT__ give state the resourc thei need __PUNCT__ and final meet our commit to special educ __PUNCT__
but that alon is not an educ polici __PUNCT__
it just a start point __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ john mccain is an honor man and i respect hi servic to our countri __PUNCT__ but he won't even get us to that start point __PUNCT__
for someon who been in washington nearli __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ he got a pretti slim record on educ __PUNCT__ and when he ha taken a stand __PUNCT__ it been the wrong on __PUNCT__
he vote against increas fund for no child left behind to preserv billion in tax break for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ tax break he want to extend without sai how he pai for them __PUNCT__
he vote against increas fund for head start __PUNCT__ and pell grant __PUNCT__ and the hire of __NUM__ new teacher again and again and again __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ hi onli propos seem to be recycl tire rhetor about voucher and school choic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i been a propon of public school choic throughout my career __PUNCT__
i applaud aft for your leadership in repres charter school teacher and support staff all across thi countri __PUNCT__ and for even oper your own charter in new york __PUNCT__
becaus we know well __PUNCT__ design public charter school have a lot to offer __PUNCT__ and i actual help pass legisl to expand them __PUNCT__
but what i do oppos is us public monei for privat school voucher __PUNCT__
we need to focu on fix and improv our public school __PUNCT__ not throw our hand up and walk awai from them __PUNCT__
real chang is final give our kid everyth thei need to have a fight chanc in todai world __PUNCT__
that begin with recogn that the singl most import factor in determin a child achiev is not the color of their skin or where thei come from __PUNCT__ it not who their parent ar or how much monei thei have __PUNCT__
it who their teacher is __PUNCT__
it the paraprofession and support staff and all of you in thi room __PUNCT__
it those who spend their own monei on book and suppli __PUNCT__ come earli and stai late compar lesson plan __PUNCT__ who devot their live to our next gener and serv as role model for the children who need on most becaus you believ that what make the extra differ __PUNCT__
and it doe __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ i have two daughter __PUNCT__
i know what their teacher mean to them __PUNCT__
so it time to start treat our teacher properli __PUNCT__
that mean resid program that suppli except recruit to high __PUNCT__ need school __PUNCT__
that mean mentor program that pair experienc __PUNCT__ success teacher with new on __PUNCT__
that mean servic scholarship that sai if you commit your life to teach __PUNCT__ america will commit to pai for your colleg educ __PUNCT__
and when our educ succe __PUNCT__ i won't just talk about how great thei ar __PUNCT__ i will reward them for it __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ district will be abl to give teacher who mentor __PUNCT__ or teach in underserv area __PUNCT__ or take on ad respons __PUNCT__ or learn new skill to serv student better __PUNCT__ or consist excel in the classroom __PUNCT__ the salari increas thei deserv __PUNCT__
and whether it the plan aft help creat in cincinnati or chicago __PUNCT__ you shown that it is possibl to find new wai to increas teacher pai that ar develop with teacher __PUNCT__ not impos on them __PUNCT__
and togeth __PUNCT__ we will begin chang the odd for our at __PUNCT__ risk children by provid qualiti __PUNCT__ afford earli childhood educ for all our children __PUNCT__
to address the achiev gap __PUNCT__ we expand afterschool and summer learn opportun __PUNCT__
to address the dropout crisi that condemn so mani futur __PUNCT__ we interven much earlier in a child educ __PUNCT__ becaus the forc that lead a high school student to drop out start well befor the ninth grade __PUNCT__
but there is no program and no polici that can substitut for a parent who is involv in their child educ from dai on __PUNCT__ who make sure that child is in school on time __PUNCT__ help them with their homework __PUNCT__ and attend those parent __PUNCT__ teacher confer __PUNCT__ who is will to turn off the tv onc in awhil __PUNCT__ put awai the video game __PUNCT__ and read to their child __PUNCT__
respons for our children educ start at home __PUNCT__
we have to set high standard for them __PUNCT__ and spend time with them __PUNCT__ and love them __PUNCT__
we have to hold ourselv account __PUNCT__
thi is the commit we must make to our kid __PUNCT__
thi is the chanc thei must have __PUNCT__
we all know there ar too mani young men and women in america right now who ar slip awai from us as we speak __PUNCT__ student who lost all hope that thei can make someth of their live __PUNCT__
you know these kid __PUNCT__
and i know these kid __PUNCT__
i began my career over two decad ago in commun on chicago south side __PUNCT__
and i work with parent and teacher and local leader to fight for their futur __PUNCT__
we set up after school program and protest outsid govern offic so that we could get those who had drop out into altern school __PUNCT__
and in time __PUNCT__ we chang the odd for our children __PUNCT__
but while i know hopeless __PUNCT__ i also know hope __PUNCT__
in mai __PUNCT__ i visit a high school in colorado where just three year ago __PUNCT__ onli half of the senior were accept to colleg __PUNCT__
but thank to the hard work of care parent __PUNCT__ innov educ __PUNCT__ and some veri commit student __PUNCT__ all forti __PUNCT__ four senior of thi year class were accept to more than seventi colleg and univers across the countri __PUNCT__
and the exampl thei set trickl down __PUNCT__
while there __PUNCT__ i met an eighth grader name theo rodriguez __PUNCT__ who now set hi sight a littl higher __PUNCT__ he want to go to oxford and studi criminolog __PUNCT__
that what hope is __PUNCT__
that the promis of educ in america __PUNCT__ that no matter what we look like or where we come from or who our parent ar __PUNCT__ each of us should have the opportun to fulfil our god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
each of us should have the chanc to achiev the american dream __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__ aft __PUNCT__
to make sure all our kid have that chanc __PUNCT__
but i need your help to get there __PUNCT__
from your earliest dai in chicago __PUNCT__ you stood up for chang __PUNCT__ when minor weren't allow full union membership __PUNCT__ when parent fought to integr our school __PUNCT__ when it wa time to take the march for civil right to washington __PUNCT__ you stood up __PUNCT__
and if you stand up with me these next four month __PUNCT__ if you march with me and knock on door and make phone call and regist voter __PUNCT__ and talk to your friend and co __PUNCT__ worker and neighbor __PUNCT__ then i promis you thi __PUNCT__ we will win thi elect __PUNCT__ we will chang educ in thi countri __PUNCT__ and we will bring about a better futur for our children and for thi countri we love __PUNCT__
