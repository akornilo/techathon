the credit crisi ha left busi larg and small unabl to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip __PUNCT__ or hire new worker __PUNCT__ or even make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
you got auto plant right here in ohio that have been around for decad close their door and lai off worker who never known anoth job in their entir life __PUNCT__
__NUM__ worker have lost their job thi year __PUNCT__
unemploy here in ohio is up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ over the last eight year __PUNCT__ which is the highest it been in sixteen year __PUNCT__

i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
i know folk ar worri __PUNCT__
but i also know thi __PUNCT__ we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we ar the countri that ha face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
we still have the most talent __PUNCT__ most product worker of ani countri on earth __PUNCT__
we still home to innov and technolog __PUNCT__ colleg and univers that ar the envi of the world __PUNCT__
some of the biggest idea in histori have come from our small busi and our research facil __PUNCT__
it won't be easi __PUNCT__ but there no reason we can't make thi centuri anoth american centuri __PUNCT__
but it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
my oppon ha made hi choic __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ senat mccain campaign announc that thei were go to __PUNCT__ turn the page __PUNCT__ on the discuss about our economi so thei can spend the final week of thi elect attack me instead __PUNCT__
hi campaign actual said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
well senat mccain mai be worri about lose an elect __PUNCT__ but i worri about american who ar lose their job __PUNCT__ and their home __PUNCT__ and their life save __PUNCT__
thei can't afford four more year of the econom theori that sai we should give more and more to millionair and billionair and hope that prosper trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__
we seen where that led us and we not go back __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
over the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__ i laid out a set of polici that will grow our middl __PUNCT__ class and strengthen our economi in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
i reform our tax code so that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili get a tax cut __PUNCT__ and elimin incom tax for senior make under __MONEY__
i bring down the cost of health care for famili and busi by invest in prevent care __PUNCT__ new technolog __PUNCT__ and give everi american the chanc to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
we ensur everi child can compet in the global economi by recruit an armi of new teacher and make colleg afford for anyon who want to go __PUNCT__
we creat five million new __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage job by invest in the renew sourc of energi that will elimin the oil we current import from the middl east in ten year __PUNCT__ and we creat two million job by rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__
but that a long __PUNCT__ term strategi for growth __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we face an immedi econom emerg that requir urgent action __PUNCT__
we can't wait to help worker and famili and commun who ar struggl right now __PUNCT__ who don't know if their job or their retir will be there tomorrow __PUNCT__ who don't know if next week paycheck will cover thi month bill __PUNCT__
we need to pass an econom rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class and we need to do it now __PUNCT__
todai i propos a number of step that we should take immedi to stabil our financi system __PUNCT__ provid relief to famili and commun __PUNCT__ and help struggl homeown __PUNCT__
it a plan that begin with on word that on everyon mind __PUNCT__ and it spell j __PUNCT__ o __PUNCT__ b __PUNCT__ s __PUNCT__
we alreadi lost three __PUNCT__ quarter of a million job thi year __PUNCT__ and some expert sai that unemploy mai rise to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by the end of next year __PUNCT__
we can't wait until then to start creat new job __PUNCT__
that why i propos to give our busi a new american job tax credit for each new employe thei hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
to fuel the real engin of job creation in thi countri __PUNCT__ i also propos elimin all capit gain tax on invest in small busi and start __PUNCT__ up compani __PUNCT__ and i propos an addit tax incent through next year to encourag new small busi invest __PUNCT__
it is time to protect the job we have and to creat the job of tomorrow by unlock the drive __PUNCT__ and ingenu __PUNCT__ and innov of the american peopl __PUNCT__
and we should fast track the loan guarante we pass for our auto industri and provid more as need so that thei can build the energi __PUNCT__ effici car america need to end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
we will also save on million job by creat a job and growth fund that will provid monei to state and local commun so that thei can move forward with project to rebuild and repair our road __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ and our school __PUNCT__
a lot of these project and these job ar at risk right now becaus of budget shortfal __PUNCT__ but thi fund will make sure thei continu __PUNCT__
the second part of my rescu plan is to provid immedi relief to famili who ar watch their paycheck shrink and their job and life save disappear __PUNCT__
i alreadi propos a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__ but todai i call on congress to pass a plan so that the ir will mail out the first round of those tax cut as soon as possibl __PUNCT__
we should also extend and expand unemploy benefit to those american who have lost their job and ar have a harder time find new on in thi weak economi __PUNCT__
and we should stop make them pai tax on those unemploy insur benefit as well __PUNCT__
at a time when the up and down of the stock market have rare been so unpredict and dramat __PUNCT__ we also need to give famili and retire more flexibl and secur when it come to their retir save __PUNCT__
i welcom senat mccain propos to waiv the rule that current forc our senior to withdraw from their __NUM__ __PUNCT__ k __PUNCT__ s even when the market is bad __PUNCT__
i think that a good idea __PUNCT__ but i think we need to do even more __PUNCT__
sinc so mani american will be struggl to pai the bill over the next year __PUNCT__ i propos that we allow everi famili to withdraw up to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ from their ira or __NUM__ __PUNCT__ k __PUNCT__ up to a maximum of __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ without ani fine or penalti throughout __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi will help famili get through thi crisi without be forc to make pain choic like sell their home or not send their kid to colleg __PUNCT__
the third part of my rescu plan is to provid relief for homeown who ar watch their home valu declin while their properti tax go up __PUNCT__
earlier thi year i push for legisl that would help homeown stai in their home by work to modifi their mortgag __PUNCT__
when secretari paulson propos hi origin financi rescu plan it includ noth for homeown __PUNCT__
when senat mccain wa silent on the issu __PUNCT__ i insist that it includ protect for homeown __PUNCT__
now the treasuri must us the author it been grant and move aggress to help peopl avoid foreclosur and stai in their home __PUNCT__
we don't need a new law or a new __MONEY__ billion giveawai to bank like senat mccain ha propos __PUNCT__ we just need to act quickli and decis __PUNCT__
i alreadi propos a mortgag tax credit for struggl homeown worth __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the interest you pai on your mortgag and we should move quickli to pass it __PUNCT__
we should also chang the unfair bankruptci law that allow judg to write down your mortgag if you own six or seven home __PUNCT__ but not if you have onli on __PUNCT__
and for all those citi and small town that ar face a choic between cut servic like health care and educ or rais properti tax __PUNCT__ we will provid the fund to prevent those tax hike from happen __PUNCT__
we cannot allow homeown and small town to suffer becaus of the mess made by wall street and washington __PUNCT__
for those american in danger of lose their home __PUNCT__ todai i also propos a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur __PUNCT__
if you ar a bank or lender that is get monei from the rescu plan that pass congress __PUNCT__ and your custom ar make a good __PUNCT__ faith effort to make their mortgag payment and re __PUNCT__ negoti their mortgag __PUNCT__ you will not be abl to foreclos on their home for three month __PUNCT__
we need to give peopl the breath room thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ thi crisi ha taught us that we cannot have a sound economi with a dysfunct financi system __PUNCT__
we pass a financi rescu plan that ha the promis to help stabil the financi system __PUNCT__ but onli if we act quickli __PUNCT__ effect and aggress __PUNCT__
the treasuri depart must move quickli with their plan to put more monei into struggl bank so thei have enough to lend __PUNCT__ and thei should do it in a wai that protect taxpay instead of enrich ceo __PUNCT__
there wa a report yesterdai that some financi institut particip in thi rescu plan ar still try to avoid restraint on ceo pai __PUNCT__
that not just wrong __PUNCT__ it an outrag to everi american whose tax dollar have been put at risk __PUNCT__
no major investor would ever make an invest if thei didn't think the corpor wa be prudent and respons __PUNCT__ and we shouldn't expect taxpay to think ani differ __PUNCT__
we should also be prepar to extend broader guarante if it becom necessari to stabil our financi system __PUNCT__
i also believ that treasuri should not limit itself to purchas mortgag __PUNCT__ back secur __PUNCT__ it should help unfreez market for individu mortgag __PUNCT__ student loan __PUNCT__ car loan __PUNCT__ and credit card loan __PUNCT__
and i think we need to do even more to make loan avail in two veri import area of our economi __PUNCT__ small busi and commun __PUNCT__
on fridai __PUNCT__ i propos small busi rescu plan that would creat an emerg lend fund to lend monei directli to small busi that need cash for their payrol or to bui inventori __PUNCT__
it what we did after 9/11 __PUNCT__ and it allow us to get low __PUNCT__ cost loan out to ten of thousand of small busi __PUNCT__
we also make it easier for privat lender to make small busi loan by expand the small busi administr loan guarante program __PUNCT__
by temporarili elimin fee for borrow and lender __PUNCT__ we can unlock the credit that small firm need to pai their worker and keep their door open __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ i also propos that we maintain the abil of state and local commun that ar struggl to maintain basic servic without rais tax to continu to get the credit thei need __PUNCT__
congress should pass thi emerg rescu plan as soon as possibl __PUNCT__
if washington can move quickli to pass a rescu plan for our financi system __PUNCT__ there no reason we can't move just as quickli to pass a rescu plan for our middl __PUNCT__ class that will creat job __PUNCT__ provid relief __PUNCT__ and help homeown __PUNCT__
and if congress doe not act in the come month __PUNCT__ it will be on of the first thing i do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
becaus we can't wait ani longer to start creat new job __PUNCT__ to help struggl commun and homeown __PUNCT__ and to provid real and immedi relief to famili who ar worri not onli about thi month bill __PUNCT__ but their entir life save __PUNCT__
thi plan will help eas those anxieti __PUNCT__ and along with the other econom polici i propos __PUNCT__ it will begin to creat new job __PUNCT__ grow famili incom __PUNCT__ and put us back on the path to prosper __PUNCT__
i won't pretend thi will be easi or come without cost __PUNCT__
we have to set prioriti as never befor __PUNCT__ and stick to them __PUNCT__
that mean pursu invest in area such as energi __PUNCT__ educ and health care that bear directli on our econom futur __PUNCT__ while defer other thing we can afford to do without __PUNCT__
it mean scour the feder budget __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__ line __PUNCT__ end program that we don't need and make the on we do work more effici and cost less __PUNCT__
it also mean promot a new ethic of respons __PUNCT__
part of the reason thi crisi occur is that everyon wa live beyond their mean __PUNCT__ from wall street to washington to even some on main street __PUNCT__
ceo got greedi __PUNCT__
politician spent monei thei didn't have __PUNCT__
lender trick peopl into bui home thei couldn't afford and some folk knew thei couldn't afford them and bought them anywai __PUNCT__
we live through an era of easi monei __PUNCT__ in which we were allow and even encourag to spend without limit __PUNCT__ to borrow instead of save __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know that in an ag of declin wage and skyrocket cost __PUNCT__ for mani folk thi wa not a choic but a necess __PUNCT__
peopl have been forc to turn to credit card and home equiti loan to keep up __PUNCT__ just like our govern ha borrow from china and other creditor to help pai it bill __PUNCT__
but we now know how danger that can be __PUNCT__
onc we get past the present emerg __PUNCT__ which requir immedi new invest __PUNCT__ we have to break that cycl of debt __PUNCT__
our long __PUNCT__ term futur requir that we do what necessari to scale down our deficit __PUNCT__ grow wage and encourag person save again __PUNCT__
it a seriou challeng __PUNCT__
but we can do it if we act now __PUNCT__ and if we act as on nation __PUNCT__
we can bring a new era of respons and account to wall street and to washington __PUNCT__
we can put in place common __PUNCT__ sens regul to prevent a crisi like thi from ever happen again __PUNCT__
we can make invest in the technolog and innov that will restor prosper and lead to new job and a new economi for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
we can restor a sens of fair and balanc that will give ever american a fair shot at the american dream __PUNCT__
and abov all __PUNCT__ we can restor confid __PUNCT__ confid in america __PUNCT__ confid in our economi __PUNCT__ and confid in ourselv __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow our own petti differ and broken polit to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ to believ in yourselv __PUNCT__ in each other __PUNCT__ and in the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when we have a crisi to solv and an economi to save __PUNCT__
not when there ar so mani american without job and without home __PUNCT__
not when there ar famili who can't afford to see a doctor __PUNCT__ or send their child to colleg __PUNCT__ or pai their bill at the end of the month __PUNCT__
not when there is a gener that is count on us to give them the same opportun and the same chanc that we had for ourselv __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
american have done thi befor __PUNCT__
some of us had grandpar or parent who said mayb i can't go to colleg but my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but my child can __PUNCT__
i mai have to rent __PUNCT__ but mayb my children will have a home thei can call their own __PUNCT__
i mai not have a lot of monei but mayb my child will run for senat __PUNCT__
i might live in a small villag but mayb somedai my son can be presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now it fall to us __PUNCT__

togeth __PUNCT__ we can overcom the broken polici and divid polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can renew an economi that reward work and rebuild the middl class __PUNCT__
