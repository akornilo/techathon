i know that i don't look like the american who previous spoken in thi great citi __PUNCT__

hi father __PUNCT__ my grandfath __PUNCT__ wa a cook __PUNCT__ a domest servant to the british __PUNCT__

and you know that the onli reason we stand here tonight is becaus men and women from both of our nation came togeth to work __PUNCT__ and struggl __PUNCT__ and sacrific for that better life __PUNCT__
our is a partnership that truli began sixti year ago thi summer __PUNCT__ on the dai when the first american plane touch down at templehof __PUNCT__
on that dai __PUNCT__ much of thi contin still lai in ruin __PUNCT__
the rubbl of thi citi had yet to be built into a wall __PUNCT__
the soviet shadow had swept across eastern europ __PUNCT__ while in the west __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__ britain __PUNCT__ and franc took stock of their loss __PUNCT__ and ponder how the world might be remad __PUNCT__
thi is where the two side met __PUNCT__
and on the twenti __PUNCT__ fourth of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ the communist chose to blockad the western part of the citi __PUNCT__
thei cut off food and suppli to more than two million german in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in berlin __PUNCT__
the size of our forc wa no match for the much larger soviet armi __PUNCT__
and yet retreat would have allow commun to march across europ __PUNCT__
where the last war had end __PUNCT__ anoth world war could have easili begun __PUNCT__
all that stood in the wai wa berlin __PUNCT__
and that when the airlift began __PUNCT__ when the largest and most unlik rescu in histori brought food and hope to the peopl of thi citi __PUNCT__
the odd were stack against success __PUNCT__
in the winter __PUNCT__ a heavi fog fill the sky abov __PUNCT__ and mani plane were forc to turn back without drop off the need suppli __PUNCT__
the street where we stand were fill with hungri famili who had no comfort from the cold __PUNCT__
but in the darkest hour __PUNCT__ the peopl of berlin kept the flame of hope burn __PUNCT__
the peopl of berlin refus to give up __PUNCT__
and on on fall dai __PUNCT__ hundr of thousand of berlin came here __PUNCT__ to the tiergarten __PUNCT__ and heard the citi mayor implor the world not to give up on freedom __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ there is onli on possibl __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ for us to stand togeth unit until thi battl is won __PUNCT__ the peopl of berlin have spoken __PUNCT__
we have done our duti __PUNCT__ and we will keep on do our duti __PUNCT__
peopl of the world __PUNCT__ now do your duti __PUNCT__ peopl of the world __PUNCT__ look at berlin __PUNCT__
peopl of the world __PUNCT__ look at berlin __PUNCT__
look at berlin __PUNCT__ where german and american learn to work togeth and trust each other less than three year after face each other on the field of battl __PUNCT__
look at berlin __PUNCT__ where the determin of a peopl met the generos of the marshal plan and creat a german miracl __PUNCT__ where a victori over tyranni gave rise to nato __PUNCT__ the greatest allianc ever form to defend our common secur __PUNCT__
look at berlin __PUNCT__ where the bullet hole in the build and the somber stone and pillar near the brandenburg gate insist that we never forget our common human __PUNCT__
peopl of the world __PUNCT__ look at berlin __PUNCT__ where a wall came down __PUNCT__ a contin came togeth __PUNCT__ and histori prove that there is no challeng too great for a world that stand as on __PUNCT__
sixti year after the airlift __PUNCT__ we ar call upon again __PUNCT__
histori ha led us to a new crossroad __PUNCT__ with new promis and new peril __PUNCT__
when you __PUNCT__ the german peopl __PUNCT__ tore down that wall __PUNCT__ a wall that divid east and west __PUNCT__ freedom and tyranni __PUNCT__ fear and hope __PUNCT__ wall came tumbl down around the world __PUNCT__
from kiev to cape town __PUNCT__ prison camp were close __PUNCT__ and the door of democraci were open __PUNCT__
market open too __PUNCT__ and the spread of inform and technolog reduc barrier to opportun and prosper __PUNCT__
while the __NUM__ centuri taught us that we share a common destini __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ ha reveal a world more intertwin than at ani time in human histori __PUNCT__
the fall of the berlin wall brought new hope __PUNCT__
but that veri close ha given rise to new danger __PUNCT__ danger that cannot be contain within the border of a countri or by the distanc of an ocean __PUNCT__
the terrorist of __DATE__ plot in hamburg and train in kandahar and karachi befor kill thousand from all over the globe on american soil __PUNCT__
as we speak __PUNCT__ car in boston and factori in beij ar melt the ic cap in the arctic __PUNCT__ shrink coastlin in the atlant __PUNCT__ and bring drought to farm from kansa to kenya __PUNCT__
poorli secur nuclear materi in the former soviet union __PUNCT__ or secret from a scientist in pakistan could help build a bomb that deton in pari __PUNCT__
the poppi in afghanistan becom the heroin in berlin __PUNCT__
the poverti and violenc in somalia breed the terror of tomorrow __PUNCT__
the genocid in darfur shame the conscienc of us all __PUNCT__
in thi new world __PUNCT__ such danger current have swept along faster than our effort to contain them __PUNCT__
that is why we cannot afford to be divid __PUNCT__
no on nation __PUNCT__ no matter how larg or power __PUNCT__ can defeat such challeng alon __PUNCT__
none of us can deni these threat __PUNCT__ or escap respons in meet them __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ in the absenc of soviet tank and a terribl wall __PUNCT__ it ha becom easi to forget thi truth __PUNCT__
and if we honest with each other __PUNCT__ we know that sometim __PUNCT__ on both side of the atlant __PUNCT__ we have drift apart __PUNCT__ and forgotten our share destini __PUNCT__
in europ __PUNCT__ the view that america is part of what ha gone wrong in our world __PUNCT__ rather than a forc to help make it right __PUNCT__ ha becom all too common __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ there ar voic that derid and deni the import of europ role in our secur and our futur __PUNCT__
both view miss the truth __PUNCT__ that european todai ar bear new burden and take more respons in critic part of the world __PUNCT__ and that just as american base built in the last centuri still help to defend the secur of thi contin __PUNCT__ so doe our countri still sacrific greatli for freedom around the globe __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ there have been differ between america and europ __PUNCT__
no doubt __PUNCT__ there will be differ in the futur __PUNCT__
but the burden of global citizenship continu to bind us togeth __PUNCT__
a chang of leadership in washington will not lift thi burden __PUNCT__
in thi new centuri __PUNCT__ american and european alik will be requir to do more __PUNCT__ not less __PUNCT__
partnership and cooper among nation is not a choic __PUNCT__ it is the on wai __PUNCT__ the onli wai __PUNCT__ to protect our common secur and advanc our common human __PUNCT__
that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new wall to divid us from on anoth __PUNCT__
the wall between old alli on either side of the atlant cannot stand __PUNCT__
the wall between the countri with the most and those with the least cannot stand __PUNCT__
the wall between race and tribe __PUNCT__ nativ and immigr __PUNCT__ christian and muslim and jew cannot stand __PUNCT__
these now ar the wall we must tear down __PUNCT__
we know thei have fallen befor __PUNCT__
after centuri of strife __PUNCT__ the peopl of europ have form a union of promis and prosper __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ at the base of a column built to mark victori in war __PUNCT__ we meet in the center of a europ at peac __PUNCT__
not onli have wall come down in berlin __PUNCT__ but thei have come down in belfast __PUNCT__ where protest and cathol found a wai to live togeth __PUNCT__ in the balkan __PUNCT__ where our atlant allianc end war and brought savag war crimin to justic __PUNCT__ and in south africa __PUNCT__ where the struggl of a courag peopl defeat apartheid __PUNCT__
so histori remind us that wall can be torn down __PUNCT__
but the task is never easi __PUNCT__
true partnership and true progress requir constant work and sustain sacrific __PUNCT__
thei requir share the burden of develop and diplomaci __PUNCT__ of progress and peac __PUNCT__
thei requir alli who will listen to each other __PUNCT__ learn from each other and __PUNCT__ most of all __PUNCT__ trust each other __PUNCT__
that is why america cannot turn inward __PUNCT__
that is why europ cannot turn inward __PUNCT__
america ha no better partner than europ __PUNCT__
now is the time to build new bridg across the globe as strong as the on that bound us across the atlant __PUNCT__
now is the time to join togeth __PUNCT__ through constant cooper __PUNCT__ strong institut __PUNCT__ share sacrific __PUNCT__ and a global commit to progress __PUNCT__ to meet the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it wa thi spirit that led airlift plane to appear in the sky abov our head __PUNCT__ and peopl to assembl where we stand todai __PUNCT__
and thi is the moment when our nation __PUNCT__ and all nation __PUNCT__ must summon that spirit anew __PUNCT__
thi is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extrem that support it __PUNCT__
thi threat is real and we cannot shrink from our respons to combat it __PUNCT__
if we could creat nato to face down the soviet union __PUNCT__ we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantl the network that have struck in madrid and amman __PUNCT__ in london and bali __PUNCT__ in washington and new york __PUNCT__
if we could win a battl of idea against the communist __PUNCT__ we can stand with the vast major of muslim who reject the extrem that lead to hate instead of hope __PUNCT__
thi is the moment when we must renew our resolv to rout the terrorist who threaten our secur in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and the traffick who sell drug on your street __PUNCT__
no on welcom war __PUNCT__
i recogn the enorm difficulti in afghanistan __PUNCT__
but my countri and your have a stake in see that nato first mission beyond europ border is a success __PUNCT__
for the peopl of afghanistan __PUNCT__ and for our share secur __PUNCT__ the work must be done __PUNCT__
america cannot do thi alon __PUNCT__
the afghan peopl need our troop and your troop __PUNCT__ our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaeda __PUNCT__ to develop their economi __PUNCT__ and to help them rebuild their nation __PUNCT__
we have too much at stake to turn back now __PUNCT__
thi is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the two superpow that face each other across the wall of thi citi came too close too often to destroi all we have built and all that we love __PUNCT__
with that wall gone __PUNCT__ we need not stand idli by and watch the further spread of the deadli atom __PUNCT__
it is time to secur all loos nuclear materi __PUNCT__ to stop the spread of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and to reduc the arsen from anoth era __PUNCT__
thi is the moment to begin the work of seek the peac of a world without nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
thi is the moment when everi nation in europ must have the chanc to choos it own tomorrow free from the shadow of yesterdai __PUNCT__
in thi centuri __PUNCT__ we need a strong european union that deepen the secur and prosper of thi contin __PUNCT__ while extend a hand abroad __PUNCT__
in thi centuri __PUNCT__ in thi citi of all citi __PUNCT__ we must reject the cold war mind __PUNCT__ set of the past __PUNCT__ and resolv to work with russia when we can __PUNCT__ to stand up for our valu when we must __PUNCT__ and to seek a partnership that extend across thi entir contin __PUNCT__
thi is the moment when we must build on the wealth that open market have creat __PUNCT__ and share it benefit more equit __PUNCT__
trade ha been a cornerston of our growth and global develop __PUNCT__
but we will not be abl to sustain thi growth if it favor the few __PUNCT__ and not the mani __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we must forg trade that truli reward the work that creat wealth __PUNCT__ with meaning protect for our peopl and our planet __PUNCT__
thi is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all __PUNCT__
thi is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the middl east __PUNCT__
my countri must stand with your and with europ in send a direct messag to iran that it must abandon it nuclear ambit __PUNCT__
we must support the lebanes who have march and bled for democraci __PUNCT__ and the isra and palestinian who seek a secur and last peac __PUNCT__
and despit past differ __PUNCT__ thi is the moment when the world should support the million of iraqi who seek to rebuild their live __PUNCT__ even as we pass respons to the iraqi govern and final bring thi war to a close __PUNCT__
thi is the moment when we must come togeth to save thi planet __PUNCT__
let us resolv that we will not leav our children a world where the ocean rise and famin spread and terribl storm devast our land __PUNCT__
let us resolv that all nation __PUNCT__ includ my own __PUNCT__ will act with the same serious of purpos as ha your nation __PUNCT__ and reduc the carbon we send into our atmospher __PUNCT__
thi is the moment to give our children back their futur __PUNCT__
thi is the moment to stand as on __PUNCT__
and thi is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a global world __PUNCT__
we must rememb that the cold war born in thi citi wa not a battl for land or treasur __PUNCT__
sixti year ago __PUNCT__ the plane that flew over berlin did not drop bomb __PUNCT__ instead thei deliv food __PUNCT__ and coal __PUNCT__ and candi to grate children __PUNCT__
and in that show of solidar __PUNCT__ those pilot won more than a militari victori __PUNCT__
thei won heart and mind __PUNCT__ love and loyalti and trust __PUNCT__ not just from the peopl in thi citi __PUNCT__ but from all those who heard the stori of what thei did here __PUNCT__
now the world will watch and rememb what we do here __PUNCT__ what we do with thi moment __PUNCT__
will we extend our hand to the peopl in the forgotten corner of thi world who yearn for live mark by digniti and opportun __PUNCT__ by secur and justic __PUNCT__ will we lift the child in bangladesh from poverti __PUNCT__ shelter the refuge in chad __PUNCT__ and banish the scourg of aid in our time __PUNCT__
will we stand for the human right of the dissid in burma __PUNCT__ the blogger in iran __PUNCT__ or the voter in zimbabw __PUNCT__ will we give mean to the word __PUNCT__ never again __PUNCT__ in darfur __PUNCT__
will we acknowledg that there is no more power exampl than the on each of our nation project to the world __PUNCT__ will we reject tortur and stand for the rule of law __PUNCT__ will we welcom immigr from differ land __PUNCT__ and shun discrimin against those who don't look like us or worship like we do __PUNCT__ and keep the promis of equal and opportun for all of our peopl __PUNCT__
peopl of berlin __PUNCT__ peopl of the world __PUNCT__ thi is our moment __PUNCT__
thi is our time __PUNCT__
i know my countri ha not perfect itself __PUNCT__
at time __PUNCT__ we struggl to keep the promis of liberti and equal for all of our peopl __PUNCT__
we made our share of mistak __PUNCT__ and there ar time when our action around the world have not live up to our best intent __PUNCT__
but i also know how much i love america __PUNCT__
i know that for more than two centuri __PUNCT__ we have strive __PUNCT__ at great cost and great sacrific __PUNCT__ to form a more perfect union __PUNCT__ to seek __PUNCT__ with other nation __PUNCT__ a more hope world __PUNCT__
our allegi ha never been to ani particular tribe or kingdom __PUNCT__ inde __PUNCT__ everi languag is spoken in our countri __PUNCT__ everi cultur ha left it imprint on our __PUNCT__ everi point of view is express in our public squar __PUNCT__
what ha alwai unit us __PUNCT__ what ha alwai driven our peopl __PUNCT__ what drew my father to america shore __PUNCT__ is a set of ideal that speak to aspir share by all peopl __PUNCT__ that we can live free from fear and free from want __PUNCT__ that we can speak our mind and assembl with whomev we choos and worship as we pleas __PUNCT__
these ar the aspir that join the fate of all nation in thi citi __PUNCT__
these aspir ar bigger than anyth that drive us apart __PUNCT__
it is becaus of these aspir that the airlift began __PUNCT__
it is becaus of these aspir that all free peopl __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ becam citizen of berlin __PUNCT__
it is in pursuit of these aspir that a new gener __PUNCT__ our gener __PUNCT__ must make our mark on the world __PUNCT__
