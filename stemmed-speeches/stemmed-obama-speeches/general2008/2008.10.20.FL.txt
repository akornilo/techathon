here in florida __PUNCT__ less than two month befor elect dai __PUNCT__ i know you all been hear a lot about polit __PUNCT__
and we all know how import women will be in determin the outcom of thi elect __PUNCT__
but as i stand here with all of you __PUNCT__ i know thi isn't just about polit for me __PUNCT__
thi is person __PUNCT__
becaus i come here todai not just as a candid for presid __PUNCT__ but as a son __PUNCT__ a grandson __PUNCT__ a husband and a father who seen firsthand __PUNCT__ throughout my life __PUNCT__ the challeng so mani women face everi dai in thi countri __PUNCT__
grow up __PUNCT__ i saw my mother struggl to put herself through school and rais me and my sister on her own __PUNCT__
she onc had to turn to food stamp __PUNCT__ but thank to student loan __PUNCT__ scholarship and a lot of hard work __PUNCT__ her kid could attend some of the best school in the countri __PUNCT__
i think women like her who work hard and pour everyth thei got into their kid should be abl to pai the bill and get ahead for a chang __PUNCT__ that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
i saw my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who help rais me __PUNCT__ work her wai up from the secretari pool to middl manag at a bank __PUNCT__
but i also saw her hit a glass ceil __PUNCT__ as men no more qualifi than she wa move up the corpor ladder ahead of her __PUNCT__
i think women like her should be paid fairli and have the same chanc to succe as everyon els __PUNCT__ that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
i seen my wife __PUNCT__ michel __PUNCT__ the rock of the obama famili __PUNCT__ juggl work and parent with more skill and grace than anyon i know __PUNCT__
but i seen how it torn at her __PUNCT__
how sometim __PUNCT__ when she with the girl __PUNCT__ she worri about work __PUNCT__ and when she at work __PUNCT__ she worri about the girl __PUNCT__
it a feel i share everi dai __PUNCT__ especi these dai __PUNCT__ when i awai so much __PUNCT__ out on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
and i think it should be a littl easier for parent in thi countri to rais their kid and do their job __PUNCT__ that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
i know how hard the women of thi countri ar work __PUNCT__
i know the anxieti so mani of you ar feel right now __PUNCT__ as we stand in the midst of the most seriou financi crisi of our time __PUNCT__
we seen three of america five largest invest bank fail or be sold off in distress __PUNCT__
our hous market is in shambl __PUNCT__ and mondai brought the worst loss on wall street sinc the dai after __DATE__ __PUNCT__
everywher you look __PUNCT__ the econom new is troubl __PUNCT__
but for so mani of you __PUNCT__ it isn't realli new at all __PUNCT__
you seen your home valu fall __PUNCT__ ga price rise __PUNCT__ and bill pile up month after month __PUNCT__
so you work longer hour __PUNCT__ or work more than on job just to get by __PUNCT__
and then there ar the job you do onc the workdai end __PUNCT__
job like pai the bill __PUNCT__ bui the groceri __PUNCT__ make the dinner __PUNCT__ do the laundri __PUNCT__ enforc the bedtim __PUNCT__ the job you don't get paid for __PUNCT__ but that hold our famili togeth __PUNCT__
job that still __PUNCT__ even in the year __NUM__ too often fall to women __PUNCT__
so i know these ar difficult dai __PUNCT__
but here what i also know __PUNCT__
i know we can steer ourselv out of thi econom crisi __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
that what we alwai done as american __PUNCT__
our nation ha face difficult time befor __PUNCT__
and at each of those moment __PUNCT__ we risen to meet the challeng becaus we never forgotten that fundament truth __PUNCT__ that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
but anoth thing i know is that we can't steer ourselv out of thi crisi by head in the same __PUNCT__ disastr direct __PUNCT__
we can't chang direct with a new driver who want to follow the same old map __PUNCT__
and that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ my oppon __PUNCT__ senat mccain __PUNCT__ gave a speech in which hi big solut to thi worldwid econom crisi wa to blame me for it __PUNCT__
thi is a gui who spent a quarter centuri in washington __PUNCT__
and after spend the entir campaign sai i haven't been in washington long enough __PUNCT__ he appar now is will to assign me respons for all of washington failur __PUNCT__
i think it pretti clear that senat mccain is a littl panick __PUNCT__ and that at thi point __PUNCT__ he is will to sai anyth __PUNCT__ do anyth __PUNCT__ chang ani posit __PUNCT__ violat ani principl to try and win thi elect __PUNCT__
and that is sad to see __PUNCT__
that not the polit we need __PUNCT__
so let be clear __PUNCT__
there onli on candid who __PUNCT__ just thi week __PUNCT__ said a line he repeat __NUM__ time on thi campaign __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ the fundament of our economi ar strong __PUNCT__
there onli on candid who call himself __PUNCT__ fundament a deregul __PUNCT__ when deregul is part of the problem __PUNCT__
my oppon actual wrote in the current issu of a health care magazin __PUNCT__ the current issu __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ open up the health insur market to more vigor nationwid competit __PUNCT__ as we have done over the last decad in bank __PUNCT__ would provid more choic of innov product less burden by the worst excess of state __PUNCT__ base regul __PUNCT__
so let me get thi straight __PUNCT__ he want to run health care like thei been run wall street __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ i know some folk on main street who aren't go to think that a good idea __PUNCT__
there onli on candid whose choic for treasuri secretari is a man who think we in a __PUNCT__ mental recess __PUNCT__ and ha call the unit state of america a __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ nation of whiner __PUNCT__
there onli on candid whose campaign is be run by seven of washington most power lobbyist __PUNCT__
and folk __PUNCT__ it isn't me __PUNCT__
i don't take a dime from washington lobbyist and special interest __PUNCT__
thei do not run my campaign __PUNCT__
thei will not run my white hous __PUNCT__
and thei will not drown out the voic of the american peopl when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so when john mccain sai that lobbyist __PUNCT__ won't even get past the front gate __PUNCT__ at hi white hous __PUNCT__ my question is __PUNCT__ who go to stop them __PUNCT__
those seven lobbyist __PUNCT__
hi campaign manag __PUNCT__
the econom advisor __PUNCT__ who got a __MONEY__ million golden parachut when she wa fire as a ceo __PUNCT__
or mayb the __NUM__ advisor and fundrais who lobbi for fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ give me a break __PUNCT__
the same dai my oppon attack me for be associ with a fanni mae gui i talk to for mayb __NUM__ minut in my entir life __PUNCT__ the same dai he did that __PUNCT__ the head of the lobbi shop at fanni mae turn around and said wait a minut __PUNCT__ when i see photograph of senat mccain staff __PUNCT__ it look to me like the team of lobbyist who us to report to me __PUNCT__
folk __PUNCT__ you can't make thi stuff up __PUNCT__
so when you hear john mccain talk about take on the ol __PUNCT__ boi network in washington __PUNCT__ know thi __PUNCT__ on the mccain campaign __PUNCT__ that call a staff meet __PUNCT__
at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ when the stake could not be higher __PUNCT__ we need real chang __PUNCT__ chang that more than just a slogan __PUNCT__ chang that actual make a differ in peopl live __PUNCT__
and that the kind of chang i bring to washington when i presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
the other dai __PUNCT__ i laid out a few princip for a plan that would establish a real and perman solut to our econom crisi __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we have to make sure that whatev plan our govern come up with work not just for wall street __PUNCT__ but for main street __PUNCT__
we have to make sure it help folk cope with rise price __PUNCT__ and spark job creation __PUNCT__ and help homeown stai in their home __PUNCT__
that the kind of help folk need right now __PUNCT__
we also have to make sure that ani plan we come up with is temporari and restor tough oversight and account on wall street __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that we not reward some of the veri ceo who help caus thi mess __PUNCT__
we not go to stand for that __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about put our economi on a firmer foot and lift up our hardwork famili __PUNCT__ there ar some addit chang we go to have to make __PUNCT__ as well __PUNCT__
becaus it an outrag that women ar still make __NUM__ cent for everi dollar that men make in thi countri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon actual oppos legisl to help women get equal pai __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ in hi view __PUNCT__ the reason women aren't be paid fairli isn't discrimin on the job __PUNCT__ it becaus thei need more educ and train __PUNCT__
that isn't chang __PUNCT__
chang is final close that pai gap __PUNCT__
it unaccept that women in thi countri ar lose thousand of dollar each year __PUNCT__ monei you could us for ga or groceri or colleg tuition __PUNCT__
thi isn't just an econom issu for million of american famili __PUNCT__ it about our most fundament valu as a nation __PUNCT__ that we treat peopl fairli __PUNCT__ that we reward hard work __PUNCT__ and there ar no second class citizen in our workplac __PUNCT__
that why i help pass a law in illinoi to give __NUM__ more women protect from paycheck discrimin __PUNCT__
that why i co __PUNCT__ sponsor legisl in the u. __PUNCT__ senat to make it easier for women to challeng pai discrimin __PUNCT__
and that why i won't give up until women in thi countri ar paid what thei earn __PUNCT__ and not a penni less __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
chang isn't a presid who think roe vs __PUNCT__ wade is a flaw decis and whose parti platform outlaw abort __PUNCT__ even in case of rape and incest __PUNCT__
chang is a presid who will stand up for choic __PUNCT__ who understand that five men on the suprem court don't know better than women and their doctor what best for a woman health __PUNCT__
that why i fought so hard in illinoi and in washington to stop law that would restrict choic __PUNCT__
that why i commit to appoint judg who understand how law oper in our daili live __PUNCT__ judg who will uphold the valu at the core of our constitut __PUNCT__
and that why i will never back down in defend a woman right to choos __PUNCT__
chang mean refus to accept an america where stai home with a new babi is treat as an unpaid vacat __PUNCT__ and take time off to take a sick parent to the hospit is a fireabl offens __PUNCT__
chang mean make sure peopl have paid sick dai and tax credit to help with childcar __PUNCT__ and expand the famili and medic leav act to help million of peopl care for their kid and their parent and particip in school activ like parent __PUNCT__ teacher confer and assembl __PUNCT__
becaus no matter what you do for a live __PUNCT__ we can all agre that rais our kid and take care of our famili is the most import job we have __PUNCT__
chang mean keep the promis of afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ if you have health insur __PUNCT__ noth chang for you __PUNCT__ except that my plan will lower your health care cost __PUNCT__
if you don't __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and i stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care the most __PUNCT__
thi is person to me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and i will never forget her ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ in her final month __PUNCT__ fight with the insur compani over whether thei cover her treatment becaus thei claim cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
that wrong __PUNCT__ it not who we ar __PUNCT__ and we go to put an end to it __PUNCT__
chang mean have a vice presid who spent hi career work to improv women live __PUNCT__
joe biden wrote the violenc against women act so we final treat domest violenc like the heinou crime that it is __PUNCT__
and in case you were wonder __PUNCT__ john mccain vote against that legisl __PUNCT__
as someon who rais small kid on hi own __PUNCT__ and took the train home everi night from washington to delawar to tuck those kid into bed __PUNCT__ joe biden also know firsthand what it mean to juggl work and famili __PUNCT__
and you won't find a stronger champion for a woman right to choos than joe biden __PUNCT__
so i proud to have him by my side in thi campaign __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ chang mean build an economi that reward work __PUNCT__ creat job you can rais a famili on __PUNCT__ and give each of us the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
and let me tell you __PUNCT__ when it come to the econom polici we pursu __PUNCT__ senat mccain and i couldn't be more differ __PUNCT__
john mccain vote nineteen time against rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__ i rais it __PUNCT__
he vote against head start __PUNCT__ against hire new teacher __PUNCT__ against pell grant __PUNCT__
i invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ and recruit an armi of new teacher to our school __PUNCT__ and provid a __MONEY__ tuition tax credit to help make colleg afford for ani middl class student who will to serv their commun or their countri __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
he want to give tax break to oil compani and compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to give a tax break to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all work famili and creat job here at home by invest in renew energi __PUNCT__
and don't be fool by the tire old attack my oppon is launch __PUNCT__
he doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be lower than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you will not see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not on dime __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i offer three time the tax relief for middl __PUNCT__ class famili as senat mccain doe __PUNCT__ becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
and i protect social secur __PUNCT__ while john mccain want to privat it __PUNCT__
without social secur half of elderli women would be live in poverti __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__
but if my oppon had hi wai __PUNCT__ the million of floridian who reli on it would had their social secur ti up in the stock market thi week __PUNCT__
million would watch as the market tumbl and their nest egg disappear befor their ey __PUNCT__
million of famili would been scrambl to figur out how to give their mother and father __PUNCT__ their grandmoth and grandfath __PUNCT__ the secur retir that everi american deserv __PUNCT__
so i know senat mccain is talk about a __PUNCT__ casino cultur __PUNCT__ on wall street __PUNCT__ but the fact is __PUNCT__ he the on who want to gambl with your life save __PUNCT__
so let be clear __PUNCT__ when i presid __PUNCT__ we not go to gambl with social secur __PUNCT__
we not go to gambl with your abil to retir with digniti after a lifetim of hard work __PUNCT__
we go to strengthen and protect social secur so it a safeti net our famili can count on __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ tomorrow and alwai __PUNCT__
florida __PUNCT__ the stake couldn't be higher __PUNCT__
the choic couldn't be clearer __PUNCT__
but still __PUNCT__ we know that bring the chang we need won't be easi __PUNCT__
we know we up against a power __PUNCT__ entrench statu quo in washington that will sai anyth and do anyth and fight with everyth thei got to keep thing just the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
but i think we up for the challeng __PUNCT__
we alwai have been __PUNCT__
that why i stand here todai __PUNCT__
becaus of what my mother and grandmoth did for me __PUNCT__ becaus of their hard work and sacrific and unflag love __PUNCT__
that why all of us ar here todai __PUNCT__ becaus of the women who came befor us __PUNCT__
women who reach for the ballot and rais famili and travel those lone road to be the first on in those boardroom and courtroom and battlefield and factori floor __PUNCT__
women like my friend hillari clinton who put those __NUM__ million crack in that glass ceil so that my daughter __PUNCT__ and all our son and daughter __PUNCT__ could dream a littl bigger and reach a littl higher __PUNCT__
now it our turn __PUNCT__
it our turn to make those sacrific so the next gener doesn't have to __PUNCT__
our turn to open the door of opportun that our daughter and granddaught will on dai walk through __PUNCT__
our turn to fulfil the promis of thi great nation that each of us __PUNCT__ no matter what our background or where we come from __PUNCT__ each of us ha the chanc to make it if we try __PUNCT__
that what i think about whenev i get the chanc to tuck my girl in at night __PUNCT__
how i want them __PUNCT__ and all our daughter __PUNCT__ to have no limit on their dream __PUNCT__ no obstacl to their achiev __PUNCT__ no goal beyond their reach __PUNCT__
how i want them to have opportun their mother and grandmoth never could imagin __PUNCT__
and i hope you join me __PUNCT__
i hope you walk with me so that we can turn the page on the fail polici of the past __PUNCT__
and if you make that commit __PUNCT__ if you knock on door and make those call and talk to your neighbor and give me your vote on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ then togeth __PUNCT__ we won't just win an elect __PUNCT__ we will transform thi nation __PUNCT__
