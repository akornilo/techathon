we meet here at a time of great uncertainti for america __PUNCT__
the era of greed and irrespons on wall street and in washington ha led us to a financi crisi as seriou as ani we have face sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
thei said thei want to let the market run free but thei let it run wild __PUNCT__ and in do so __PUNCT__ thei trampl our core valu of fair __PUNCT__ balanc __PUNCT__ and respons to on anoth __PUNCT__
everywher you look __PUNCT__ the econom new is troubl __PUNCT__
but for so mani american __PUNCT__ it isn't realli new at all __PUNCT__
__NUM__ worker have lost their job sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__
home valu ar fall __PUNCT__
your paycheck doesn't go as far as it us to __PUNCT__
it never been harder to save or retir __PUNCT__ to bui ga or groceri __PUNCT__ and if you put it on a credit card __PUNCT__ thei probabl rais your rate __PUNCT__
in so mani citi and town across america __PUNCT__ it feel as if the dream that so mani gener have fought for is slowli slip awai __PUNCT__
last night we had a debat __PUNCT__
and on issu after issu __PUNCT__ from tax to health care to the war in iraq __PUNCT__ you heard john mccain make the case for more of the same polici that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
but just as import as what we heard from john mccain wa what we didn't hear __PUNCT__
we talk about the economi for forti minut __PUNCT__ and not onc did senat mccain talk about the struggl that middl class famili ar face everi dai right here in north carolina and around the countri __PUNCT__
he defend hi plan to give __MONEY__ billion in tax cut to corpor and the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ but he had noth to sai about the fact that wage have flat __PUNCT__ line and job ar be ship oversea __PUNCT__
he rail against some studi of bear in montana __PUNCT__ but he had noth to sai about the fact that more and more american can't afford to pai for colleg __PUNCT__ can't afford health care for their famili __PUNCT__ and can't afford a retir that is dignifi and secur __PUNCT__
senat mccain spoke again and again about the need to keep spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ but he said noth about the need to end thi war so that we can invest in good job __PUNCT__ and rebuild our road and bridg and broadband line right here in america __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ through nineti minut of debat __PUNCT__ john mccain had a lot to sai about me __PUNCT__ but he had noth to sai about you __PUNCT__
he didn't even sai the word __PUNCT__ middl class __PUNCT__
not onc __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i think senat mccain just doesn't get it __PUNCT__ he doesn't get that thi crisi on wall street hit main street a long time ago __PUNCT__
that why hi first respons to the greatest fiscal meltdown in gener wa to sai that the __PUNCT__ fundament of the economi ar strong __PUNCT__
that why he been shift posit these last two week __PUNCT__ look for a photo __PUNCT__ op __PUNCT__ and try to figur out what to sai and what to do __PUNCT__
well north carolina __PUNCT__ i know what we need to do __PUNCT__
we need to stop give those tax cut to corpor and ceo on wall street __PUNCT__ and start stand up for famili out on main street __PUNCT__
we need to turn the page on the fail polici of the last eight year __PUNCT__ and final put work peopl first __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we don't need ani more out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ your __PUNCT__ own leadership in washington __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will chang thi economi so that it final work for your famili __PUNCT__
we need a presid who know that america strength and leadership abroad depend on the strength of our economi at home __PUNCT__
we need a presid who will fight for the middl class everi singl dai __PUNCT__ and that exactli what i do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult dai __PUNCT__
but here what i also know __PUNCT__
i know we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi __PUNCT__
becaus that who we ar __PUNCT__
becaus that what we alwai done as american __PUNCT__
our nation ha face difficult time befor __PUNCT__
and at each of those moment __PUNCT__ we risen to meet the challeng becaus we never forgotten that fundament truth __PUNCT__ that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
there ar mani to blame for caus the crisi we ar in __PUNCT__ and that start with the specul on wall street who game the system and the regul in washington who look the other wai __PUNCT__
but now that we here __PUNCT__ everi american __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ ceo and factori worker __PUNCT__ ha a stake in solv thi crisi and save our financi system from collaps __PUNCT__
becaus if we don't act and act soon __PUNCT__ your job __PUNCT__ your life save __PUNCT__ and your econom secur will be put at risk __PUNCT__
thi administr start off by ask for a blank check to solv thi problem __PUNCT__
i said absolut not __PUNCT__
it is unaccept to expect the american peopl to hand thi administr or ani administr a __MONEY__ billion check with no condit and no oversight when a lack of oversight in washington and on wall street is exactli what got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
if the american peopl ar be ask to pai for the solut to thi crisi __PUNCT__ then you have a right to make sure that your tax dollar ar protect __PUNCT__
that why i laid out a few a condit for washington __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to set up an independ board __PUNCT__ select by democrat and republican __PUNCT__ to provid oversight and account for how and where thi monei is spent at everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ if american taxpay ar financ thi solut __PUNCT__ you should be treat like investor __PUNCT__
that mean that wall street and washington should give you everi penni of your monei back onc thi economi recov __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we cannot and will not simpli bailout wall street without help the million of innoc homeown who ar struggl to stai in their home __PUNCT__
thei deserv a plan too __PUNCT__
and washington need to feel the same sens of urgenc in pass an econom stimulu plan for work famili __PUNCT__ a plan that would help folk cope with rise food and ga price __PUNCT__ save on million job by rebuild our school and road __PUNCT__ and help state and citi avoid budget cut and tax increas __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ and thi on is import __PUNCT__ the american peopl should not be spend on dime to reward the same wall street ceo whose greed and irrespons got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
there ha been talk that some ceo mai refus to cooper with thi plan if thei have to give up their multi __PUNCT__ million __PUNCT__ dollar salari __PUNCT__
i cannot imagin a posit more selfish and greedi at a time of nation crisi __PUNCT__
so i will not allow thi plan to becom a welfar program for wall street execut __PUNCT__
now i glad that senat mccain ha embrac some of these principl __PUNCT__ but the john mccain you heard from over the last few dai is a lot differ than the john mccain who been in washington for the last twenti __PUNCT__ six year __PUNCT__
he talk about get tough on wall street now __PUNCT__ but he been against the common __PUNCT__ sens rule and regul that could stop thi mess for decad __PUNCT__
he sai he take on the corpor lobbyist __PUNCT__ but he put seven of the biggest lobbyist in washington in charg of hi campaign __PUNCT__
and if you think those lobbyist ar work dai and night to elect my oppon just to put themselv out of busi __PUNCT__ well i got a bridg to sell you up in alaska __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ when my oppon first react to thi crisi by sai that the fundament of our economi ar strong __PUNCT__ he didn't just make a mistak __PUNCT__
he reveal an out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch philosophi he follow for decad in washington __PUNCT__ the idea that if we give more and more to those with the most __PUNCT__ prosper will trickl down to everyon els __PUNCT__ the idea that no harm will be done if we let lobbyist shred consum protect and fight against everi regul as unwis or unnecessari __PUNCT__
well what we have seen over the last few week is noth less than the final verdict on thi fail philosophi __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state becaus the dream of the american peopl cannot be endang anymor __PUNCT__
we have a differ wai of measur the fundament of our economi __PUNCT__
we know that the fundament that we us to measur econom strength ar whether we ar live up to that fundament promis that ha made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that america is a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__ that everyon should have the chanc to live their dream __PUNCT__
i know i wouldn't be stand here todai without that promis __PUNCT__
and i know that the promis we must keep onc more __PUNCT__
when i talk to those young veteran who come back from iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ i see my grandfath __PUNCT__ who sign up after pearl harbor __PUNCT__ march in patton armi __PUNCT__ and wa reward by a grate nation with the chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
in the face of that young student who sleep just three hour befor work the night shift __PUNCT__ i think about my mom __PUNCT__ who rais my sister and me on her own while she work and earn her degre __PUNCT__ who onc turn to food stamp but wa still abl to send us to the best school in the countri __PUNCT__
and when i listen to anoth worker tell me that hi factori ha shut down __PUNCT__ i rememb all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decad ago after the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
these ar my hero __PUNCT__
their ar the stori that shape me __PUNCT__
and it is on their behalf that i intend to win thi elect and keep the promis of america aliv as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
unlik senat mccain __PUNCT__ it didn't take a crisi on wall street for me to understand that folk ar hurt out on main street __PUNCT__
it wa two year ago that i introduc legisl to stop mortgag transact that promot fraud __PUNCT__ risk or abus __PUNCT__
it wa on year ago that i call on our treasuri secretari and our fed chairman to bring everi stakehold togeth and find a solut to the subprim mortgag meltdown befor it got wors __PUNCT__
in march __PUNCT__ when john mccain wa sai __PUNCT__ i alwai for less regul __PUNCT__ i call for a new __PUNCT__ __NUM__ centuri regulatori framework to restor account __PUNCT__ transpar __PUNCT__ and trust in our financi market __PUNCT__
i believ that our free market ha been the engin of america great progress __PUNCT__
it a market that ha creat a prosper that is the envi of the world __PUNCT__ and reward the innov and risk __PUNCT__ taker who have made america a beacon of scienc __PUNCT__ and technolog __PUNCT__ and discoveri __PUNCT__
but the american economi ha work in larg part becaus we have guid the market invis hand with a higher principl __PUNCT__ that america prosper when all american can prosper __PUNCT__
that the chang we need right now __PUNCT__
and that the kind of chang i bring to washington when i presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
chang mean a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyist who wrote it __PUNCT__ but the american worker and small busi who deserv it __PUNCT__
i will stop give tax break to corpor that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and i will start give them to compani that creat good job right here in america __PUNCT__ job just like the __NUM__ union job that at&t just creat over in goldsboro base on their pledg to return outsourc work to our shore __PUNCT__
i will elimin capit gain tax for small busi and start __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ that how we grow our economi and creat the high __PUNCT__ wage __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
i will cut tax __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all work famili __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
if you make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you will not see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i offer three time the tax relief for middl __PUNCT__ class famili as senat mccain doe __PUNCT__ becaus in an economi like thi __PUNCT__ the last thing we should do is rais tax on the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
i will final keep the promis of afford __PUNCT__ access health care for everi singl american __PUNCT__
if you have health care __PUNCT__ my plan will lower your premium __PUNCT__
if you don't __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
and i will stop insur compani from discrimin against those who ar sick and need care the most __PUNCT__
i will also creat the job of the futur by transform our energi economi __PUNCT__
we tap our natur ga reserv __PUNCT__ invest in clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ and find wai to safe har nuclear power __PUNCT__
i help our auto compani re __PUNCT__ tool __PUNCT__ so that the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of the futur ar built right here in america __PUNCT__
i make it easier for the american peopl to afford these new car __PUNCT__
and i invest __NUM__ billion dollar over the next decad in afford __PUNCT__ renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__ wind power and solar power and the next gener of biofuel __PUNCT__ an invest that will lead to new industri and five million new job that pai well and can't ever be outsourc
and now is the time to final meet our moral oblig to provid everi child a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ becaus it will take noth less to compet in the global economi __PUNCT__
i recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them higher salari and give them more support __PUNCT__
but in exchang __PUNCT__ i will ask for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and we will keep our promis to everi young american __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__
thi is the chang we need __PUNCT__ the kind of bottom up growth and innov that will advanc the american economi by advanc the dream of all american __PUNCT__
time ar hard __PUNCT__
i will not pretend that the chang we need will come without cost __PUNCT__ though i have present how we can achiev these chang in a fiscal respons wai __PUNCT__
i know that we have to overcom our doubt and divis and the determin opposit of power special interest befor we can truli reform a broken economi and advanc opportun __PUNCT__
but i am run for presid becaus we simpli cannot afford four more year of an econom philosophi that work for wall street instead of main street __PUNCT__ and end up devast both __PUNCT__
i don't want to wake up in four year to find that more american fell out of the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and more famili lost their save __PUNCT__
i don't want to see that our countri fail to invest in our abil to compet __PUNCT__ our children futur wa mortgag on anoth mountain of debt __PUNCT__ and our financi market fail to find a firmer foot __PUNCT__
at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ we have the chanc to final stand up and sai __PUNCT__ enough is enough __PUNCT__
we can do thi becaus american have done thi befor __PUNCT__
time and again __PUNCT__ we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
that why our economi hasn't just been the world greatest wealth gener __PUNCT__ it bound america togeth __PUNCT__ it creat job __PUNCT__ and it made the dream of opportun a realiti for gener after gener of american __PUNCT__
now it fall to us __PUNCT__
and i need you to make it happen __PUNCT__
if you want the next four year look just like the last eight __PUNCT__ then i am not your candid __PUNCT__
but if you want real chang __PUNCT__ if you want an economi that reward work __PUNCT__ and that work for main street and wall street __PUNCT__ if you want tax relief for the middl class and million of new job __PUNCT__ if you want health care you can afford and educ that help your kid compet __PUNCT__ then i ask you to knock on some door __PUNCT__ make some call __PUNCT__ talk to your neighbor __PUNCT__ and give me your vote on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
