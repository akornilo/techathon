it great to be at ketter __PUNCT__ a univers that is teach the next gener of leader __PUNCT__ and train worker to have the skill thei need to advanc their own career and commun __PUNCT__
for month __PUNCT__ the state of our economi ha domin the headlin __PUNCT__ and the new hasn't been good __PUNCT__
the sub __PUNCT__ prime lend debacl ha sent the hous market into a tailspin __PUNCT__ and caus a broader contract in the credit market __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ job have been lost thi year __PUNCT__ with the unemploy rate regist the biggest on month jump sinc __DATE__ __PUNCT__
incom have fail to keep pace with the rise cost of health insur and colleg __PUNCT__ and record oil and food price have left famili struggl just to keep up __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ grim econom new is noth new to flint __PUNCT__
manufactur job have been leav here for decad now __PUNCT__
the job that have replac them pai less __PUNCT__ and offer fewer __PUNCT__ if ani benefit __PUNCT__
hard __PUNCT__ work american who could onc count on a singl __PUNCT__ paycheck to support their famili have not onli lost job __PUNCT__ but their health care and their pension as well __PUNCT__
worst of all __PUNCT__ mani have lost confid in that fundament american promis that our children will have a better life than we do __PUNCT__
so these ar challeng time __PUNCT__
that why i spent last week talk about immedi step we need to take to provid work american with relief __PUNCT__
a broad __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ middl class tax cut __PUNCT__ to help offset the rise cost of ga and food __PUNCT__
a foreclosur prevent fund __PUNCT__ to help stabil the hous market __PUNCT__
a health care plan that lower cost and give those without health insur the same kind of coverag member of congress have __PUNCT__
a commit to retir secur that stabil social secur __PUNCT__ and provid worker a mean to increas save __PUNCT__
and a plan to crack down on unfair and sometim decept lend in the credit card and hous market __PUNCT__ to help famili climb out of crippl debt __PUNCT__ and stai out of debt in the first place __PUNCT__
these step ar all paid for __PUNCT__ and design to restor balanc and fair to the american economi after year of bush administr polici that tilt the plai field in favor of the wealthi and the well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ none of these short __PUNCT__ term step alon will ensur america futur __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we have to make sure that the econom pie is slice more fairli __PUNCT__ but we also have to make sure that the econom pie is grow __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we need to provid immedi help to famili who ar struggl in place like flint __PUNCT__ but we also need a seriou plan to creat new job and industri __PUNCT__
we can't simpli return to the strategi of the past __PUNCT__
for we ar live through an ag of fundament econom transform __PUNCT__
technolog ha chang the wai we live and the wai the world doe busi __PUNCT__
the collaps of the soviet union and the advanc of capit have vanquish old challeng to america global leadership __PUNCT__ but new challeng have emerg __PUNCT__ from china and india __PUNCT__ eastern europ and brazil __PUNCT__
job and industri can move to ani countri with an internet connect and will worker __PUNCT__
michigan children will grow up face competit not just from california or south carolina __PUNCT__ but also from beij and bangalor __PUNCT__
a few year ago __PUNCT__ i saw a pictur of thi new realiti dure a visit to googl headquart in california __PUNCT__
toward the end of my tour __PUNCT__ i wa brought into a room where a three __PUNCT__ dimension imag of the earth rotat on a larg flat __PUNCT__ panel monitor __PUNCT__
across thi imag __PUNCT__ there were countless light in differ color __PUNCT__
a young engin explain that the light repres all of the internet search take place across the world __PUNCT__ and each color repres a differ languag __PUNCT__
the imag wa mesmer __PUNCT__ a pictur of a world where old boundari ar disappear __PUNCT__ a world where commun __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ and competit can come from anywher __PUNCT__
there ar some who believ that we must try to turn back the clock on thi new world __PUNCT__ that the onli chanc to maintain our live standard is to build a fortress around america __PUNCT__ to stop trade with other countri __PUNCT__ shut down immigr __PUNCT__ and reli on old industri __PUNCT__
i disagre __PUNCT__
not onli is it imposs to turn back the tide of global __PUNCT__ but effort to do so can make us wors off __PUNCT__
rather than fear the futur __PUNCT__ we must embrac it __PUNCT__
i have no doubt that america can compet __PUNCT__ and succe __PUNCT__ in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and i know as well that more than anyth els __PUNCT__ success will depend not on our govern __PUNCT__ but on the dynam __PUNCT__ determin __PUNCT__ and innov of the american peopl __PUNCT__
here in flint __PUNCT__ it wa the privat sector that help turn lumber into the wagon that sent thi countri west __PUNCT__ that built the tank that face down fascism __PUNCT__ and that turn out the automobil that were the cornerston of america manufactur boom __PUNCT__
but at critic moment of transit like thi on __PUNCT__ success ha also depend on nation leadership that move the countri forward with confid and a common purpos __PUNCT__
that what our found father did after win independ __PUNCT__ when thei ti togeth the economi of the thirteen state and creat the american market __PUNCT__
that what lincoln did in the midst of civil war __PUNCT__ when he push for a transcontinent railroad __PUNCT__ incorpor our nation academi of scienc __PUNCT__ pass the homestead act __PUNCT__ and creat our system of land grant colleg __PUNCT__
that what fdr did in confront capit gravest crisi __PUNCT__ when he forg the social safeti net __PUNCT__ built the hoover dam __PUNCT__ creat the tennesse vallei author __PUNCT__ and invest in an arsen of democraci __PUNCT__
and that what kennedi did in the dark dai of the cold war __PUNCT__ when he call us to a new frontier __PUNCT__ creat the apollo program __PUNCT__ and put us on a pathwai to the moon __PUNCT__
thi wa leadership that had the strength to turn moment of advers into opportun __PUNCT__ the wisdom to see a littl further down the road __PUNCT__ and the courag to challeng convent think and worn idea so that we could reinvent our economi to seiz the futur __PUNCT__
that not the kind of leadership that we have seen out of washington recent __PUNCT__
but that the kind of leadership i intend to provid as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
these past eight year will be rememb for misguid polici __PUNCT__ miss opportun __PUNCT__ and a rigid and ideolog adher to discredit idea __PUNCT__
almost a decad into thi centuri __PUNCT__ we still have no real strategi to compet in a global economi __PUNCT__
just think of what we could have done __PUNCT__
we could have made a real commit to a world __PUNCT__ class educ for our kid __PUNCT__ but instead we pass __PUNCT__ no child left behind __PUNCT__ a law that __PUNCT__ howev well __PUNCT__ intend __PUNCT__ left the monei behind and alien teacher and princip instead of inspir them __PUNCT__
we could have done someth to end our addict to oil __PUNCT__ but instead we continu down a path that that fund both side of the war on terror __PUNCT__ endang our planet __PUNCT__ and ha left american struggl with four dollar a gallon gasolin __PUNCT__
we could have invest in innov and rebuilt our crumbl road and bridg __PUNCT__ but instead we spent hundr of billion of dollar fight a war in iraq that should never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
wors yet __PUNCT__ the price __PUNCT__ tag for these failur is be pass to our children __PUNCT__
the clinton administr left behind a surplu __PUNCT__ but thi administr squander it __PUNCT__
we face budget deficit in the hundr of billion and our nearli ten trillion dollar in debt __PUNCT__
we borrow billion from countri like china to financ needless tax cut for the wealthiest american and an unnecessari war __PUNCT__ and yet senat mccain is explicitli run to continu and expand these polici __PUNCT__ without a realist plan to pai for it __PUNCT__
the pundit talk about two debat __PUNCT__ on on nation secur and on on the economi __PUNCT__ but thei miss the point __PUNCT__
we didn't win the cold war just becaus of the strength of our militari __PUNCT__
we also prevail becaus of the vigor of our economi and the endur of our ideal __PUNCT__
in thi centuri __PUNCT__ we won't be secur if we bankrol terrorist and dictat through our depend on oil __PUNCT__
we won't be safe if we can't count on our infrastructur __PUNCT__
we won't extend the promis of american great unless we invest in our young peopl and ask them to invest in america __PUNCT__
so there is a clear choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
instead of reach for new horizon __PUNCT__ georg bush ha put us in a hole __PUNCT__ and john mccain polici will keep us there __PUNCT__
i want to take us in a new and better direct __PUNCT__
i reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challeng of global __PUNCT__ or fall back on the same tire and fail approach of the last eight year __PUNCT__
it time for new polici that creat the job and opportun of the futur __PUNCT__ a competit agenda built upon educ and energi __PUNCT__ innov and infrastructur __PUNCT__ fair trade and reform __PUNCT__
thi agenda start with educ __PUNCT__
whether you conserv or liber __PUNCT__ republican or democrat __PUNCT__ practic everi economist agre that in thi digit ag __PUNCT__ a highli __PUNCT__ educ and skill workforc will be the kei not onli to individu opportun __PUNCT__ but to the overal success of our economi as well __PUNCT__
we cannot be satisfi until everi child in america __PUNCT__ and i mean everi child __PUNCT__ ha the same chanc for a good educ that we want for our own children __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ despit thi consensu __PUNCT__ we continu fail to deliv __PUNCT__
a few year ago __PUNCT__ i visit a high school outsid chicago __PUNCT__
the number on concern i heard from those student wa that the school district couldn't afford to keep teacher for a full dai __PUNCT__ so school let out at __NUM__ everi afternoon __PUNCT__
that cut out critic class like scienc and lab __PUNCT__
imagin that __PUNCT__ these kid want more school __PUNCT__
thei knew thei were be short __PUNCT__ chang __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ stori like thi can be found across america __PUNCT__
onli __NUM__ percent of student ar prepar to take colleg class in english __PUNCT__ math and scienc __PUNCT__
we have on of the highest dropout rate of ani industri nation __PUNCT__ and bare on tenth of our low __PUNCT__ incom student will graduat from colleg __PUNCT__
that will crippl their abil to keep pace in thi global economi __PUNCT__ and compromis our abil to compet as a nation __PUNCT__
senat mccain doesn't talk about educ much __PUNCT__
but i don't accept the statu quo __PUNCT__
it is moral unaccept and econom unten __PUNCT__
it time to make an histor commit to educ __PUNCT__ a real commit that will requir new resourc and new reform __PUNCT__
we can start by invest __MONEY__ billion to guarante access to qualiti __PUNCT__ afford __PUNCT__ earli childhood educ for everi child in america __PUNCT__
everi dollar that we spend on these program put our children on a path to success __PUNCT__ while save us as much as __MONEY__ in reduc health care cost __PUNCT__ crime __PUNCT__ and welfar later on __PUNCT__
we can fix the failur of no child left behind __PUNCT__ while focus on account __PUNCT__
that mean provid the fund that wa promis __PUNCT__
more importantli __PUNCT__ it mean reach high standard __PUNCT__ but not by reli on a singl __PUNCT__ high stake standard test that distort how teacher teach __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we need to work with governor __PUNCT__ educ and especi teacher to develop better assess tool that effect measur student achiev __PUNCT__ and encourag the kind of research __PUNCT__ scientif investig __PUNCT__ and problem __PUNCT__ solv that our children will need to compet __PUNCT__
and we need to recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__
i make thi pledg as presid __PUNCT__ if you commit your life to teach __PUNCT__ america will pai for your colleg educ __PUNCT__
we recruit teacher in math and scienc __PUNCT__ and deploi them to under __PUNCT__ staf school district in our inner citi and rural america __PUNCT__
we expand mentor program that pair experienc teacher with new recruit __PUNCT__
and when our teacher succe __PUNCT__ i won't just talk about how great thei ar __PUNCT__ i reward their great with better pai and more support __PUNCT__
but research show that resourc alon won't creat the school that we need to help our children succe __PUNCT__
we also need to encourag innov __PUNCT__ by adopt curricula and the school calendar to the need of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ by updat the school of educ that produc most of our teacher __PUNCT__ by welcom charter school within the public school system __PUNCT__ and streamlin the certif process for engin or businesspeopl who want to shift career and teach __PUNCT__
we must also challeng the system that prevent us from promot and reward excel in teach __PUNCT__
we cannot ask our teacher to perform the imposs __PUNCT__ to teach poorli prepar children with inadequ resourc __PUNCT__ and then punish them when children perform poorli on a standard test __PUNCT__
but if we give teacher the resourc thei need __PUNCT__ if we pai them more __PUNCT__ and give them time for profession develop __PUNCT__ if thei ar given ownership over the design of better assess tool and a creativ curricula __PUNCT__ if we shape reform with teacher rather than impos chang on teacher __PUNCT__ then it is fair to expect better result __PUNCT__
where there ar teacher who ar still struggl and underperform __PUNCT__ we should provid them with individu help and support __PUNCT__
and if thei still underperform after that __PUNCT__ we should find a quick and fair wai to put anoth teacher in that classroom __PUNCT__
our children deserv no less __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ our commit cannot end with a high school degre __PUNCT__
the chanc to get a colleg educ must not be a privileg of the few __PUNCT__ it should be a birthright of everi singl american __PUNCT__
senat mccain is campaign on a plan to give more tax break to corpor __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to young peopl __PUNCT__ in the form of an annual __MONEY__ tax credit that will cover two __PUNCT__ third of the tuition at an averag public colleg __PUNCT__ and make commun colleg complet free __PUNCT__
in return __PUNCT__ i will ask student to serv __PUNCT__ whether it by teach __PUNCT__ join the peac corp __PUNCT__ or work in your commun __PUNCT__
and for those who serv in our militari __PUNCT__ we cover all of your tuition with an even more gener __NUM__ centuri gi bill __PUNCT__
the idea is simpl __PUNCT__ america invest in you __PUNCT__ and you invest in america __PUNCT__
that how we go to ensur that america succe in thi centuri __PUNCT__
reform our educ system will requir sustain effort from all of us __PUNCT__ parent and teacher __PUNCT__ feder __PUNCT__ state and local govern __PUNCT__
the same is true for the second leg of our competit agenda __PUNCT__ a bold and sustain energi polici __PUNCT__
in the past __PUNCT__ america ha been stir to action when a new challeng threaten our nation secur __PUNCT__
that wa true when german and japanes armi advanc across europ and asia __PUNCT__ or when the soviet launch sputnik __PUNCT__
the energi threat we face todai mai be less direct __PUNCT__ but it is real __PUNCT__
our depend on foreign oil strain famili budget and sap our economi __PUNCT__
oil monei pai for the bomb go off from baghdad to beirut __PUNCT__ and the bombast of dictat from caraca to tehran __PUNCT__
our nation will not be secur unless we take that leverag awai __PUNCT__ and our planet will not be safe unless we move decis toward a clean energi futur __PUNCT__
the danger ar eclips onli by the opportun that would come with chang __PUNCT__
we know the job of the __NUM__ centuri will be creat in develop altern energi __PUNCT__
the question is whether these job will be creat in america __PUNCT__ or abroad __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ we seen countri like germani __PUNCT__ spain and brazil reap the benefit of econom growth from clean energi __PUNCT__
but we ar decad behind in confront thi challeng __PUNCT__
georg bush ha spent most of hi administr deni that we have a problem __PUNCT__ and make deal with big oil behind close door __PUNCT__
and while john mccain deserv credit for speak out against the threat of climat chang __PUNCT__ hi rhetor is undercut by a record of vote time and again against import invest in renew energi
it time to make energi secur a lead prioriti __PUNCT__
my energi plan will invest __MONEY__ billion over the next ten year to establish a green energi sector that will creat up to __NUM__ million job over the next two decad __PUNCT__
good job __PUNCT__ like the on i saw in pennsylvania where worker make wind turbin __PUNCT__ or the job that will be creat when plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid or electr car start roll off the assembl line here in michigan __PUNCT__
we help manufactur __PUNCT__ particularli in the auto industri __PUNCT__ convert to green technolog __PUNCT__ and help worker learn the skill thei need __PUNCT__
and unlik georg bush __PUNCT__ i won't wait until the sixth year of my presid to sit down with the automak __PUNCT__
i meet with them dure my campaign __PUNCT__ and i meet with them as presid to talk about how we go to build the car of the futur right here in michigan __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ we will invest in research and develop of everi form of altern energi __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ and biofuel __PUNCT__ as well as technolog that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe __PUNCT__
we will provid incent to busi and consum to save energi and make build more effici __PUNCT__
that how we go to creat job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
that how we go to win back control of our own destini from oil __PUNCT__ rich dictat __PUNCT__
and that how we solv the problem of __MONEY__ a gallon ga __PUNCT__ not with anoth washington gimmick like john mccain ga tax holidai that would pad oil compani profit while drain the highwai fund that michigan depend on __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ our commit to manufactur cannot end with green job __PUNCT__
that why i end tax break that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and invest in american job __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha a differ view __PUNCT__
he vote to keep tax incent that encourag compani to move abroad __PUNCT__
he should listen to leader in michigan like carl levin __PUNCT__ who have put forward seriou propos to address the crisi in manufactur __PUNCT__
we need to support program like michigan __NUM__ centuri job fund __PUNCT__ and build on best practic across the countri __PUNCT__
that why i creat an advanc manufactur fund to invest in place hit hard by job loss __PUNCT__
i partner with commun colleg __PUNCT__ so that we train worker to meet the demand of local industri __PUNCT__
and we can't just focu on preserv exist industri __PUNCT__
we have to be in the busi of encourag new on __PUNCT__ and that mean scienc __PUNCT__ research and technolog __PUNCT__
for two centuri __PUNCT__ america led the world in innov __PUNCT__
but thi administr hostil to scienc ha taken a toll __PUNCT__
at a time when technolog is shape our futur __PUNCT__ we devot a smaller and smaller share of our nation resourc to research and develop __PUNCT__
it time for america to lead __PUNCT__
i doubl feder fund for basic research __PUNCT__ and make the r&d tax credit perman __PUNCT__
we can ensur that the discoveri of the __NUM__ centuri happen in america __PUNCT__ in our lab and univers __PUNCT__ at place like ketter and the univers of michigan __PUNCT__ wayn state and michigan state __PUNCT__
encourag new industri also mean give more support to american entrepreneur __PUNCT__
the other dai __PUNCT__ senat mccain gave a speech to the small busi summit where he attack my plan to provid tax relief for the middl class __PUNCT__
what he didn't sai is that i also propos exempt all start __PUNCT__ up compani from capit gain tax __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ john mccain would tax them __PUNCT__
i won't __PUNCT__
we work __PUNCT__ at everi junctur __PUNCT__ to remov bureaucrat barrier for small and startup busi __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ by make the patent process more effici and reliabl __PUNCT__
and we help with technic support to do everyth we can to make sure the next googl or microsoft is start here in america __PUNCT__
and we know that america won't be abl to compet if skyrocket cost caus compani like the big three to spend __MONEY__ on health care for everi car __PUNCT__ and condemn million of american to the risk of no coverag __PUNCT__
that why we need to commit ourselv to electron medic record that enhanc care while lower cost __PUNCT__
we need to invest in biomed research and stem cell research __PUNCT__ so that we at the lead edg of prevent and treatment __PUNCT__
and we need to final pass univers health care so that everi american ha access to health insur that thei can afford __PUNCT__ and our get the prevent servic that ar the kei to cut health care cost __PUNCT__
that what i pledg to do in my first term as presid __PUNCT__
a third part of our agenda must be a commit to __NUM__ centuri infrastructur __PUNCT__
if we want to keep up with china or europ __PUNCT__ we can't settl for crumbl road and bridg __PUNCT__ ag water and sewer pipe __PUNCT__ and falter electr grid that cost us billion to blackout __PUNCT__ repair and travel delai __PUNCT__
it gotten so bad that the american societi of civil engin gave our nation infrastructur a __PUNCT__ d __PUNCT__
a centuri ago __PUNCT__ teddi roosevelt call togeth leader from busi and govern to develop a plan for __NUM__ centuri infrastructur __PUNCT__
it fall to us to do the same __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a nation infrastructur reinvest bank that will invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year __PUNCT__ a bank that can leverag privat invest in infrastructur improv __PUNCT__ and creat nearli two million new job __PUNCT__
the work will be determin by what will maxim our safeti and secur and abil to compet __PUNCT__
we will fund thi bank as we bring the war in iraq to a respons close __PUNCT__
it time to stop spend billion of dollar a week on a blank check for an iraqi govern that won't spend it own oil revenu __PUNCT__
it time to strengthen transport and to protect vulner target from terror at home __PUNCT__
we can modern our power grid __PUNCT__ which will help conserv and spur on the develop and distribut of clean energi __PUNCT__
we can invest in rail __PUNCT__ so that citi like detroit __PUNCT__ chicago __PUNCT__ milwauke and st __PUNCT__ loui ar connect by high __PUNCT__ speed train __PUNCT__ and folk have altern to air travel __PUNCT__
that what we can do if we commit to rebuild a stronger america __PUNCT__
as part of thi commit to infrastructur __PUNCT__ we need to upgrad our digit superhighwai as well __PUNCT__
when i look at that map of the world mount on the screen at googl __PUNCT__ i wa struck at first by the light gener by internet search come from everi corner of the earth __PUNCT__
but then i wa struck by the dark __PUNCT__
huge chunk of africa and part of asia where the light of the inform revolut ha yet to shine __PUNCT__
and then i notic portion of the unit state where the thick cord of light dissolv into a few discret strand __PUNCT__
it is unaccept that here __PUNCT__ in the countri that invent the internet __PUNCT__ we fell to __NUM__ in the world in broadband deploy __PUNCT__
when kid in downtown flint or rural iowa can't afford or access high __PUNCT__ speed internet __PUNCT__ that set back america abil to compet __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will set a simpl goal __PUNCT__ everi american should have the highest speed broadband access __PUNCT__ no matter where you live __PUNCT__ or how much monei you have __PUNCT__
we connect school __PUNCT__ librari and hospit __PUNCT__
and we take on special interest to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safeti and connect __PUNCT__
a revamp educ system __PUNCT__
a bold new energi strategi __PUNCT__
a more effici health care system __PUNCT__
renew invest in basic research and our infrastructur __PUNCT__
these ar the pillar of a more competit economi that will take advantag of the global marketplac opportun __PUNCT__
but even as we welcom competit __PUNCT__ we need to rememb that our econom polici must be support by strong and smart trade polici __PUNCT__
i have said befor __PUNCT__ and will sai again __PUNCT__ i believ in free trade __PUNCT__
it can save monei for our consum __PUNCT__ gener busi for u. __PUNCT__ export __PUNCT__ and expand global wealth __PUNCT__
but unlik georg bush and john mccain __PUNCT__ i do not think that ani trade agreement is a good trade agreement __PUNCT__
i don't think an agreement that allow south korea to import hundr of thousand of car into the u. __PUNCT__ but continu to restrict u. __PUNCT__ car export into south korea to a few thousand __PUNCT__ is a smart deal __PUNCT__
i don't think that trade agreement without labor or environment agreement ar in our long term interest
if we continu to let our trade polici be dictat by special interest __PUNCT__ then american worker will continu to be undermin __PUNCT__ and public support for robust trade will continu to erod __PUNCT__
that might make sens to the washington lobbyist who run senat mccain campaign __PUNCT__ but it won't help our nation compet __PUNCT__
allow subsid and unfairli trade product to flood our market is not free trade and it not fair to the peopl of michigan __PUNCT__
we cannot stand by while countri manipul currenc to promot export __PUNCT__ creat huge imbal in the global economi __PUNCT__
we cannot let foreign regulatori polici exclud american product __PUNCT__
we cannot let enforc of exist trade agreement take a backseat to the negoti of new on __PUNCT__
put simpli __PUNCT__ we need tougher negoti on our side of the tabl __PUNCT__ to strike bargain that ar good not just for wall street __PUNCT__ but also for main street __PUNCT__
and when i am presid __PUNCT__ that what we will do __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ let me sai a word about fiscal respons __PUNCT__
i recogn that my agenda is ambiti __PUNCT__ particularli in light of bush administr fiscal polici that have run up the nation debt by over __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
entitl spend is bound to increas as the babi boom gener retir __PUNCT__
but the answer to our fiscal problem is not to continu to short __PUNCT__ chang invest in educ __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ innov and infrastructur __PUNCT__ invest that ar vital to long __PUNCT__ term growth __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we need to end the iraq war __PUNCT__ elimin wast in exist govern program __PUNCT__ gener revenu by charg pollut for the greenhous gase thei ar send into our atmospher __PUNCT__ and put an end to the reckless __PUNCT__ special interest driven corpor loophol and tax cut for the wealthi that have been the centerpiec of the bush administr econom polici __PUNCT__
john mccain want to doubl down on georg bush disastr polici __PUNCT__ not onli by make perman the bush tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__ but by __MONEY__ billion in new tax cut that give a quarter of their revenu to household make over __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
wors yet __PUNCT__ he hasn't detail how he would pai for thi new give __PUNCT__ awai __PUNCT__
there is noth fiscal conserv about thi approach __PUNCT__
it will continu to drive up deficit __PUNCT__ forc us to borrow massiv from foreign countri __PUNCT__ and shift the burden on to work peopl todai and our children tomorrow __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ john mccain will shortchang invest in educ __PUNCT__ energi and innov __PUNCT__ make the next gener of american less abl to compet __PUNCT__
that unaccept __PUNCT__
it time to make tough choic so that we have a smarter govern that pai it wai and make the right invest for america futur __PUNCT__
it fall to us to shape a new centuri __PUNCT__
everi aspect of our govern should be under review __PUNCT__
we can ill __PUNCT__ afford needless layer of bureaucraci and outmod program __PUNCT__
my administr will open up the door of democraci __PUNCT__
we put govern data onlin __PUNCT__ and us technolog to shine a light on spend __PUNCT__
we invit the servic and particip of american citizen __PUNCT__ and cut through the red tape to make sure that everi agenc is meet cut edg standard __PUNCT__
we make it clear to the special interest that their dai of set the agenda in washington ar over __PUNCT__ becaus the american peopl ar not the problem in thi __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ thei ar the answer __PUNCT__
we have a choic __PUNCT__
we can continu the bush statu quo __PUNCT__ as senat mccain want to do __PUNCT__ and we will becom a countri in which few reap the benefit of the global economi __PUNCT__ while a grow number work harder for less and depend upon an overburden public sector __PUNCT__
an america in which we run up deficit and expos ourselv to the whim of oil __PUNCT__ rich dictat while the opportun for our children and grandchildren shrink __PUNCT__
that is on cours we could take __PUNCT__
or __PUNCT__ we can rise togeth __PUNCT__
if we choos to chang __PUNCT__ just imagin what we can do __PUNCT__
the great manufactur of the __NUM__ centuri can turn out car that run on renew energi in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
biotechnolog lab can find new cure __PUNCT__ new rail line and roadwai can connect our commun __PUNCT__ good made here in michigan can be export around the world __PUNCT__
our children can get a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ and their dream of tomorrow can eclips even our greatest hope of todai __PUNCT__
we can choos to rise togeth __PUNCT__
but it won't be easi __PUNCT__
everi on of us will have to work at it by studi harder __PUNCT__ train more rigor __PUNCT__ work smarter __PUNCT__ and think anew __PUNCT__
we have to slough off bad habit __PUNCT__ reform our institut __PUNCT__ and re __PUNCT__ engag the world __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__ becaus thi is america __PUNCT__ a countri that ha been defin by a determin to believ in __PUNCT__ and work for __PUNCT__ thing unseen __PUNCT__
everi so often __PUNCT__ there ar time when america must rise to meet a moment __PUNCT__
so it ha been for the gener that built the railroad and beat back the depress __PUNCT__ that work on the first assembl line and that went to the moon __PUNCT__
