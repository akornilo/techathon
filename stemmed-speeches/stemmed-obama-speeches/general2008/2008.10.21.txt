anyon see that __PUNCT__
it wa realli amaz __PUNCT__
he decid to make up thi notion that i been attack joe the plumber __PUNCT__
even though just yesterdai __PUNCT__ joe himself said that not true __PUNCT__
and even though he know full well that my plan will cut tax for work joe and small businesspeopl all across thi countri to help them pursu their dream __PUNCT__
becaus i want to help rebuild the middl class that ha taken such a hit these past eight year under the polici of georg bush and john mccain __PUNCT__
and when senat mccain call me a __PUNCT__ socialist __PUNCT__ and sai i want to give a tax cut to peopl who don't pai tax __PUNCT__ he know that not true __PUNCT__
my middl class tax cut ar for peopl who work and pai tax __PUNCT__
appar senat mccain decid that if he can't beat our idea __PUNCT__ he make up other and run against those __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ what we need now is not straw men and mislead charg __PUNCT__
what we need is honest leadership and real chang __PUNCT__ and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ more than ever __PUNCT__ thi campaign ha to be about the problem face the american peopl __PUNCT__ becaus thi is a moment of great uncertainti for america __PUNCT__
the econom crisi we face is the worst sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
busi larg and small ar find it imposs to get loan __PUNCT__ which mean thei can't bui new equip __PUNCT__ or hire new worker __PUNCT__ or even make payrol for the worker thei have __PUNCT__
we lost more than __NUM__ job thi year __PUNCT__ and we just learn that here in florida __PUNCT__ we lost nearli __NUM__ job in __DATE__ alon __PUNCT__
wage ar lower than thei been in a decad __PUNCT__ at a time when the cost of health care and colleg have never been higher __PUNCT__
it get harder and harder to make the mortgag __PUNCT__ or fill up your ga tank __PUNCT__ or even keep the electr on at the end of the month __PUNCT__
at thi rate __PUNCT__ the question isn't just __PUNCT__ ar you better off than you were four year ago __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ ar you better off than you were four week ago __PUNCT__
so i know these ar difficult time __PUNCT__
i know folk ar worri __PUNCT__
but i believ that we can steer ourselv out of thi crisi becaus i believ in thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus i believ in you __PUNCT__
i believ in the american peopl __PUNCT__
we ar the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we ar a nation that face down war and depress __PUNCT__ great challeng and great threat __PUNCT__
and at each and everi moment __PUNCT__ we have risen to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ not as democrat __PUNCT__ not as republican __PUNCT__ but as american __PUNCT__
with resolv __PUNCT__
with confid __PUNCT__
with that fundament belief that here in america __PUNCT__ our destini is not written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__ and that the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
but florida __PUNCT__ i know thi __PUNCT__
it will take a new direct __PUNCT__
it will take new leadership in washington __PUNCT__
it will take a real chang in the polici and polit of the last eight year __PUNCT__
and that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
becaus the truth is __PUNCT__ the financi crisi we face didn't just spring up full __PUNCT__ blown overnight __PUNCT__
thi ha been a long time come __PUNCT__ and the warn sign have been veri clear __PUNCT__
but while presid bush and senat mccain were readi to move heaven and earth to address the crisi on wall street __PUNCT__ presid bush ha fail to address the crisi on main street __PUNCT__ and senat mccain ha fail to fulli acknowledg it __PUNCT__
instead of commonsens solut __PUNCT__ month after month __PUNCT__ thei offer littl more than will ignor __PUNCT__ wish think __PUNCT__ and outdat ideolog __PUNCT__
nine month ago __PUNCT__ back in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i call for a stimulu plan to provid immedi relief for state __PUNCT__ along with tax rebat to get monei directli to middl class famili and a foreclosur prevent fund to help peopl keep their home __PUNCT__
senat mccain __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ insist that the fundament of the economi were strong __PUNCT__
hi advisor openli mock the stimulu plan befor congress __PUNCT__ on refer to it __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ borrow monei from the chines and drop it from helicopt __PUNCT__
anoth dismiss it as __PUNCT__ junk __PUNCT__
last __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i call for a job and growth fund to help state put peopl to work rebuild and repair our road __PUNCT__ bridg and school __PUNCT__
and i call for __MONEY__ billion to help state and local govern pai for servic and avoid rais properti tax __PUNCT__ becaus tax increas ar the last thing our famili need in an economi like thi __PUNCT__
but presid bush and senat mccain thought that a second stimulu packag wa unnecessari __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ after nine straight month of job loss __PUNCT__ when our feder reserv chairman support anoth stimulu to get our economi move __PUNCT__ someth even the bush administr is open to __PUNCT__ senat mccain econom advisor made it clear that senat mccain still isn't readi to support a stimulu __PUNCT__
he take a wait and see approach __PUNCT__
and instead of offer a real plan to boost our economi __PUNCT__ senat mccain ha offer a propos that doe noth to creat job __PUNCT__ noth to help famili with fall wage and mount bill __PUNCT__ and next to noth to help peopl stai in their home __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he call for a hous propos that noth but a __MONEY__ billion bailout for wall street bank __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i got new for senat mccain __PUNCT__ hard work famili who been hard hit by thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ folk who can't pai their mortgag or their medic bill or send their kid to colleg __PUNCT__ thei can't afford to wait and see __PUNCT__
thei can't afford to go to the back of the line behind ceo and wall street bank __PUNCT__
thei need help right here __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ it funni __PUNCT__ recent __PUNCT__ i heard senat mccain sai that i more concern with who get your piec of the pie than with grow the pie __PUNCT__
but make no mistak about it __PUNCT__ after eight year of bush __PUNCT__ mccain econom __PUNCT__ the pie is shrink __PUNCT__
that mean lower wage and declin incom and plummet home valu and rise unemploy __PUNCT__
so my oppon is do hi best to chang the subject and try to distract attent from the economi __PUNCT__
senat mccain campaign actual said a coupl of week ago that thei were go to launch a seri of attack on my charact becaus __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ if we keep talk about the economi __PUNCT__ we go to lose __PUNCT__
and that a promis john mccain ha kept __PUNCT__
he been on the attack __PUNCT__
that what you do when you ar out of idea __PUNCT__ out of touch __PUNCT__ and run out of time __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i can take a few more week of john mccain attack __PUNCT__ but the american peopl can't take four more year of the same fail polici and the same fail polit __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on eight year of econom polici that put wall street befor main street but end up hurt both __PUNCT__
we need polici that grow our economi from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ so that everi american __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
not just the person who own the factori __PUNCT__ but the men and women who work on it floor __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ it that we all connect __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ and we will rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
the rescu plan that pass congress wa a necessari first step to eas thi credit crisi __PUNCT__ but if we go to rebuild thi economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__ we need an immedi rescu plan for the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and that what i offer as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
that start with tax relief __PUNCT__
there been a lot of talk about tax in thi campaign __PUNCT__
and the truth is __PUNCT__ my oppon and i ar both propos tax cut __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he want to give a __MONEY__ tax cut to the averag fortun __NUM__ ceo __PUNCT__
i want to put a middl class tax cut in the pocket of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of worker and their famili __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want you to know thi __PUNCT__ but under my plan __PUNCT__ tax rate will actual be less than thei were under ronald reagan __PUNCT__
it true that i want to roll back the bush tax cut on the wealthiest american and go back to the rate thei paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
john mccain call that social __PUNCT__
what he forget is that just a few year ago __PUNCT__ he himself said those bush tax cut were irrespons __PUNCT__
he said he couldn't __PUNCT__ in good conscienc __PUNCT__ support a tax cut where the benefit went to the wealthi at the expens of __PUNCT__ middl class american who most need tax relief __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he wa right then __PUNCT__ and i am right now __PUNCT__
and let me be crystal clear __PUNCT__ if you make less than a quarter of a million dollar a year __PUNCT__ which includ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of small busi owner __PUNCT__ you won't see your tax increas on singl dime __PUNCT__
not your payrol tax __PUNCT__ not your incom tax __PUNCT__ not your capit gain tax __PUNCT__ noth __PUNCT__
that is my commit to you __PUNCT__
to creat more american job __PUNCT__ i propos a tax credit for each new employe that compani hire here in the unit state over the next two year __PUNCT__
i stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea and invest in compani that creat good job right here in florida __PUNCT__
and i help small busi get back on their feet by elimin capit gain tax and give them emerg loan to keep their door open and hire worker __PUNCT__
i also ensur that we act quickli to help struggl homeown stai in their home __PUNCT__ someth that particularli import here in florida __PUNCT__ where foreclosur ar up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ over the past year __PUNCT__
i help respons homeown refin their mortgag on afford term and put in place a three __PUNCT__ month moratorium on foreclosur to give folk the breath room thei need to get back on their feet __PUNCT__
and i won't let bank and lender off the hook when it wa their greed and irrespons that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
we should not be bail out wall street __PUNCT__ we should be restor opportun on main street __PUNCT__
and that what we do when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
these ar the step that we must take __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ to start get our economi back on track __PUNCT__
but we also need a new set of prioriti to grow our economi and creat job over the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ billion a year in renew sourc of energi to creat five million new __PUNCT__ green job over the next decad __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__ job build solar panel and wind turbin and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ job that will help us end our depend on oil from middl east dictat __PUNCT__
i also put two million more american to work rebuild our crumbl road __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ and bridg __PUNCT__ becaus it is time to build an american infrastructur for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and if peopl ask how we go to pai for thi __PUNCT__ you tell them that if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month in iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend some monei to rebuild america __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will final fix the problem in our health care system that we been talk about for too long __PUNCT__
thi issu is person for me __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer at the ag of __NUM__ and i never forget how she spent the final month of her life ly in a hospit bed __PUNCT__ fight with her insur compani becaus thei claim that her cancer wa a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit and didn't want to pai for treatment __PUNCT__
if i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure those insur compani can never do that again __PUNCT__
my health care plan will make sure insur compani can't discrimin against those who ar sick and need care most __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that will chang under my plan is that we will lower premium __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ you be abl to get the same kind of health insur that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and we invest in prevent care and new technolog to final lower the cost of health care for famili __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the entir economi __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
and if i presid __PUNCT__ we give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the skill and the knowledg thei need to compet with ani worker __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
i will not allow countri to out __PUNCT__ teach us todai so thei can out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
it is time to provid everi american with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support in exchang for higher standard and more account __PUNCT__
and it mean make a deal with everi american who ha the drive and the will but not the monei to go to colleg __PUNCT__
my oppon top econom advisor actual said that thei have no plan to invest in colleg afford becaus we can't have a giveawai to everi special interest __PUNCT__
well i don't think the young peopl of america ar a special interest __PUNCT__ thei ar the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i make thi deal with you __PUNCT__ if you commit to serv your commun or your countri __PUNCT__ we will make sure you can afford your tuition __PUNCT__
no if __PUNCT__ and or but __PUNCT__
you invest in america __PUNCT__ america will invest in you __PUNCT__ and togeth __PUNCT__ we will move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ make no mistak __PUNCT__ the chang we need won't come easi or without cost __PUNCT__
we will all need to tighten our belt __PUNCT__ we will all need to sacrific and we will all need to pull our weight becaus now more than ever __PUNCT__ we ar all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
at a defin moment like thi __PUNCT__ we don't have the luxuri of reli on the same polit game and the same polit tactic that ar us everi elect to divid us from on anoth and make us afraid of on anoth __PUNCT__
with the challeng and crise we face right now __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to divid thi countri by class or region __PUNCT__ by who we ar or what polici we support __PUNCT__
there ar no real or fake part of thi countri __PUNCT__
we ar not separ by the pro __PUNCT__ america and anti __PUNCT__ america part of thi nation __PUNCT__ we all love thi countri __PUNCT__ no matter where we live or where we come from __PUNCT__
there ar patriot who support thi war in iraq and patriot who oppos it __PUNCT__ patriot who believ in democrat polici and those who believ in republican polici __PUNCT__
the men and women from florida and all across america who serv on our battlefield mai be democrat and republican and independ __PUNCT__ but thei have fought togeth and bled togeth and some di togeth under the same proud flag __PUNCT__
thei have not serv a red america or a blue america __PUNCT__ thei have serv the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we have alwai been at our best when we had leadership that call us to look past our differ and come togeth as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__ leadership that ralli thi entir countri to a common purpos __PUNCT__ to a higher purpos __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state of america becaus that is the countri we need to be right now __PUNCT__
thi countri and the dream it repres ar be test in a wai that we haven't seen in nearli a centuri __PUNCT__
and futur gener will judg our by how we respond to thi test __PUNCT__
will thei sai that thi wa a time when america lost it wai and it purpos __PUNCT__ when we allow the same divis and fear tactic and our own petti differ to plung thi countri into a dark and pain recess __PUNCT__
or will thei sai that thi wa anoth on of those moment when america overcam __PUNCT__ when we battl back from advers by recogn that common stake that we have in each other success __PUNCT__
thi is on of those moment __PUNCT__
i realiz you cynic and fed up with polit __PUNCT__
i understand that you disappoint and even angri with your leader __PUNCT__
you have everi right to be __PUNCT__
but despit all of thi __PUNCT__ i ask of you what been ask of the american peopl in time of trial and turmoil throughout our histori __PUNCT__
i ask you to believ __PUNCT__ to believ in yourselv __PUNCT__ in each other __PUNCT__ and in the futur we can build togeth __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we cannot fail __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
not when we have a crisi to solv and an economi to save __PUNCT__
not when there ar so mani american without job and without home __PUNCT__
not when there ar famili who can't afford to see a doctor __PUNCT__ or send their child to colleg __PUNCT__ or pai their bill at the end of the month __PUNCT__
not when there is a gener that is count on us to give them the same opportun and the same chanc that we had for ourselv __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
american have done thi befor __PUNCT__
some of us had grandpar or parent who said mayb i can't go to colleg but my child can __PUNCT__ mayb i can't have my own busi but my child can __PUNCT__
i mai have to rent __PUNCT__ but mayb my children will have a home thei can call their own __PUNCT__
