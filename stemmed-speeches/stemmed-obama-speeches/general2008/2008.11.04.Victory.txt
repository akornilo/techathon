it wa built by work men and women who dug into what littl save thei had to give five dollar and ten dollar and twenti dollar to thi caus __PUNCT__
it grew strength from the young peopl who reject the myth of their gener apathi __PUNCT__ who left their home and their famili for job that offer littl pai and less sleep __PUNCT__ from the not __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ young peopl who brave the bitter cold and scorch heat to knock on the door of perfect stranger __PUNCT__ from the million of american who volunt __PUNCT__ and organ __PUNCT__ and prove that more than two centuri later __PUNCT__ a govern of the peopl __PUNCT__ by the peopl and for the peopl ha not perish from thi earth __PUNCT__

let us rememb that if thi financi crisi taught us anyth __PUNCT__ it that we cannot have a thrive wall street while main street suffer __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ we rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
let us resist the temptat to fall back on the same partisanship and petti and immatur that ha poison our polit for so long __PUNCT__
let us rememb that it wa a man from thi state who first carri the banner of the republican parti to the white hous __PUNCT__ a parti found on the valu of self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__ individu liberti __PUNCT__ and nation uniti __PUNCT__
those ar valu we all share __PUNCT__ and while the democrat parti ha won a great victori tonight __PUNCT__ we do so with a measur of humil and determin to heal the divid that have held back our progress __PUNCT__

and what we have alreadi achiev give us hope for what we can and must achiev tomorrow __PUNCT__
thi elect had mani first and mani stori that will be told for gener __PUNCT__
but on that on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in atlanta __PUNCT__
she a lot like the million of other who stood in line to make their voic heard in thi elect except for on thing __PUNCT__ ann nixon cooper is __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
she wa born just a gener past slaveri __PUNCT__ a time when there were no car on the road or plane in the sky __PUNCT__ when someon like her couldn't vote for two reason __PUNCT__ becaus she wa a woman and becaus of the color of her skin __PUNCT__
and tonight __PUNCT__ i think about all that she seen throughout her centuri in america __PUNCT__ the heartach and the hope __PUNCT__ the struggl and the progress __PUNCT__ the time we were told that we can't __PUNCT__ and the peopl who press on with that american creed __PUNCT__ ye we can __PUNCT__
at a time when women voic were silenc and their hope dismiss __PUNCT__ she live to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
when there wa despair in the dust bowl and depress across the land __PUNCT__ she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a new deal __PUNCT__ new job and a new sens of common purpos __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
when the bomb fell on our harbor and tyranni threaten the world __PUNCT__ she wa there to wit a gener rise to great and a democraci wa save __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
she wa there for the buse in montgomeri __PUNCT__ the hose in birmingham __PUNCT__ a bridg in selma __PUNCT__ and a preacher from atlanta who told a peopl that __PUNCT__ we shall overcom __PUNCT__ ye we can __PUNCT__
a man touch down on the moon __PUNCT__ a wall came down in berlin __PUNCT__ a world wa connect by our own scienc and imagin __PUNCT__
and thi year __PUNCT__ in thi elect __PUNCT__ she touch her finger to a screen __PUNCT__ and cast her vote __PUNCT__ becaus after __NUM__ year in america __PUNCT__ through the best of time and the darkest of hour __PUNCT__ she know how america can chang __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ we have come so far __PUNCT__
we have seen so much __PUNCT__
but there is so much more to do __PUNCT__
so tonight __PUNCT__ let us ask ourselv __PUNCT__ if our children should live to see the next centuri __PUNCT__ if my daughter should be so lucki to live as long as ann nixon cooper __PUNCT__ what chang will thei see __PUNCT__ what progress will we have made __PUNCT__
