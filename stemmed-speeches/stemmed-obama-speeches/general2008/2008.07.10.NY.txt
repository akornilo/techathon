and thank to all of you for join us here todai __PUNCT__
i want to start by sai a few word about the woman you just heard from __PUNCT__
as someon who took the same histor journei as senat clinton __PUNCT__ who share a stage with her mani time over those sixteen month __PUNCT__ i know firsthand how tough she is __PUNCT__ how passion she is __PUNCT__ how commit she is to the caus that bring us here todai __PUNCT__
i know that what drive her todai __PUNCT__ and everi dai __PUNCT__ is exactli what led her to the children defens fund year ago __PUNCT__ it what led her to reform struggl school in arkansa and fight for health care as first ladi __PUNCT__ it what ha made her an outstand senat from new york and a histor candid for the presid __PUNCT__ an unyield desir to improv the live of ordinari american __PUNCT__
and you can rest assur that when we final win the battl for univers health care in thi countri __PUNCT__ it will be becaus of her tireless work __PUNCT__
when we final transform our energi polici __PUNCT__ and lift our children out of poverti __PUNCT__ and make our economi work for work famili again __PUNCT__ it will be becaus she help make it happen __PUNCT__
i admir her as a leader __PUNCT__ i learn from her as a candid __PUNCT__ i am proud to call her my friend __PUNCT__ and i know how much we need both hillari clinton and bill clinton as a parti and a countri in the month and year to come __PUNCT__
hillari and i mai have start with separ goal in thi campaign __PUNCT__ but togeth __PUNCT__ we shatter barrier that have stood firm sinc the found of thi nation __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we all know that on elect can't eras the bias and outdat attitud we still wrestl to overcom __PUNCT__
and we know there were time dure thi campaign when those bias emerg __PUNCT__
but while thi campaign ha shown us how far we have to go __PUNCT__ we also know that becaus of what hillari accomplish __PUNCT__ my daughter and your look at themselv a littl differ todai __PUNCT__
thei dream a littl bigger and set their sight a littl higher todai __PUNCT__
and the question we face now is __PUNCT__ what kind of futur ar we go to build for them __PUNCT__ it a question i ask not just as a candid for presid __PUNCT__ but as a father think about the challeng my girl will face as thei start career and famili of their own __PUNCT__
it a question i ask as a son __PUNCT__ a grandson __PUNCT__ and a husband who seen some of the women i love most in the world confront so mani of these challeng themselv __PUNCT__
i saw my mother __PUNCT__ a young __PUNCT__ singl mom __PUNCT__ put herself through school __PUNCT__ and follow her passion for help other while rais me and my sister __PUNCT__
but i also saw how she struggl to provid for us __PUNCT__ worri at time about how she pai the bill __PUNCT__
i saw my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who help rais me __PUNCT__ work her wai up from a secretari at a bank to becom on of the first women bank vice presid in the state __PUNCT__
but i also saw how she ultim hit a glass ceil __PUNCT__ how men no more qualifi than she wa kept move up the corpor ladder ahead of her __PUNCT__
and i see my wife __PUNCT__ michel __PUNCT__ the rock of the obama famili __PUNCT__ juggl job and parent with more skill and grace than anyon i know __PUNCT__
but i also seen how it tear at her __PUNCT__
how sometim __PUNCT__ when she with the girl __PUNCT__ she worri about work __PUNCT__ and when she at work __PUNCT__ she worri about the girl __PUNCT__
it a feel i share everi dai __PUNCT__ especi these dai __PUNCT__ when i awai so much out on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
it someth i hear all the time from work parent __PUNCT__ especi work women __PUNCT__ mani of whom ar work more than on job to make end meet __PUNCT__
and then there ar the job you have onc the workdai end __PUNCT__ whether it clean the hous or pai the bill or bui the groceri __PUNCT__ help with that scienc project or enforc those bedtim __PUNCT__
the job you don't get paid for __PUNCT__ but that hold our famili togeth __PUNCT__
job that still __PUNCT__ even in the year __NUM__ far too often fall to women __PUNCT__
but let be clear __PUNCT__ these issu __PUNCT__ equal pai __PUNCT__ work/famili balanc __PUNCT__ childcar __PUNCT__ these ar by no mean just women issu __PUNCT__
when a job doesn't offer famili leav __PUNCT__ that also hurt men who want to help care for a new babi or an ail parent __PUNCT__
when there no afford childcar or afterschool program __PUNCT__ that hurt children who wind up in second rate care __PUNCT__ or spend afternoon alon in front of the tv __PUNCT__
when women still make just __NUM__ cent for everi dollar men make __PUNCT__ black and latina women even less __PUNCT__ that doesn't just hurt women __PUNCT__ it hurt famili who find themselv with less incom __PUNCT__ and have to work even harder just to get by __PUNCT__
so you think solv these problem would be on of our highest nation prioriti __PUNCT__
but while some politician in washington make a lot of nois about famili valu __PUNCT__ when it come to what peopl actual need to support their famili __PUNCT__ and care for their famili __PUNCT__ and spend time with their famili __PUNCT__ thei get awfulli quiet __PUNCT__ don't thei __PUNCT__ and year after year __PUNCT__ it just get harder for work parent __PUNCT__ especi work women __PUNCT__ to make a live while rais their kid __PUNCT__
we take it for grant that women ar the backbon of our famili __PUNCT__ but we too often ignor the fact that women ar also the backbon of our middl class __PUNCT__
and we won't truli have an economi that put the need of the middl class first until we ensur that when it come to pai and benefit at work __PUNCT__ women ar treat like the equal partner thei ar __PUNCT__
as the son __PUNCT__ grandson and husband of hard __PUNCT__ work mother __PUNCT__ i don't accept an america that make women choos between their kid and their career __PUNCT__
it unaccept that women ar deni job or promot becaus thei got kid at home __PUNCT__
it unaccept that __NUM__ million work women don't have a singl paid sick dai __PUNCT__
it unaccept that million of work mother could actual be fire for take matern leav __PUNCT__ and that __NUM__ percent of worker who have famili leav can't afford to take it becaus it not paid __PUNCT__
no matter what you do for live __PUNCT__ i think we can all agre that rais our children and care for our love on is the most import job we have __PUNCT__
and it time we start make that job a littl bit easier __PUNCT__ especi for work women __PUNCT__
that mean give work parent tax credit to help with childcar and provid afterschool and summer learn program and earli childhood educ to keep our kid safe and ensur thei start school readi to learn __PUNCT__
it mean dramat expand the famili and medic leav act to reach million of peopl who aren't cover todai __PUNCT__ and ensur peopl can take leav not just to stai home with a new babi __PUNCT__ but also to care for elderli parent and particip in school activ like parent __PUNCT__ teacher confer and assembl __PUNCT__
it mean stand up for paid leav __PUNCT__ and paid sick leav __PUNCT__ becaus no on should be punish for get sick or deal with a famili crisi __PUNCT__
and it mean fight for equal pai for women __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ when __NUM__ percent of work women in america earn half __PUNCT__ or more than half __PUNCT__ of their famili incom __PUNCT__ you think the pai gap would be a thing of the past __PUNCT__
or that we at least be unit in our determin to guarante that women ar paid fairli for their work __PUNCT__
but senat mccain and i have a real differ on thi issu __PUNCT__
he think the suprem court got it right last year when thei hand down the ledbett decis that make it more difficult for women to challeng pai discrimin at work __PUNCT__
he oppos legisl that i co __PUNCT__ sponsor to revers that decis __PUNCT__
he suggest that the reason women don't have equal pai isn't discrimin on the job __PUNCT__ it becaus thei need more educ and train __PUNCT__
well let be clear __PUNCT__ the problem in these kind of case isn't that women ar somehow unqualifi or unprepar for higher __PUNCT__ pai posit __PUNCT__
the problem is that some employ aren't pai women fairli __PUNCT__
the problem is that too mani women aren't abl to challeng employ who ar underpai them __PUNCT__
and the solut is to final close that gap and pai women what thei earn __PUNCT__ noth less __PUNCT__
thi isn't just an econom issu for million of american and their famili __PUNCT__
it a question of who we ar as a countri __PUNCT__ of whether we go to live up to our valu as a nation __PUNCT__
and let be clear __PUNCT__ the suprem court rule on equal pai is just the tip of the iceberg in term of what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
usual __PUNCT__ when we talk about the court __PUNCT__ it in the context of reproduct right and roe v __PUNCT__ wade __PUNCT__
and make no mistak about it __PUNCT__ that a critic issu in thi elect __PUNCT__
senat mccain ha made it abundantli clear that he want to appoint justic like robert and alito __PUNCT__ and that he hope to see roe overturn __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i stand by my vote against confirm justic robert and alito __PUNCT__
and i made it equal clear that i will never back down in defend a woman right to choos __PUNCT__
but the suprem court also affect women live in so mani other wai __PUNCT__ from decis on equal pai __PUNCT__ to workplac discrimin __PUNCT__ to titl ix __PUNCT__ to domest violenc __PUNCT__ to civil right and worker __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
and the question we face in thi elect is whether we have judg who demonstr sound judgment and empathi __PUNCT__ who understand how law oper in our daili live __PUNCT__ who ar commit to uphold the valu at the core of our constitut __PUNCT__ or judg who put ideolog befor justic __PUNCT__ with our fundament right as the first casualti __PUNCT__
and that just the begin __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ we also face question about the fundament issu that will shape the world in which our son and daughter live __PUNCT__
we face question about whether we allow the divid between main street and wall street to grow as our economi continu to struggl __PUNCT__ or build an economi that work for all our famili __PUNCT__ where our prosper is onc again the tide that lift everi boat __PUNCT__
whether we continu to spend ten billion dollar a month in iraq and leav our troop there for the next twenti year __PUNCT__ or fifti year __PUNCT__ or on hundr year __PUNCT__ or start bring them home __PUNCT__ refocus on al qaeda in afghanistan __PUNCT__ rebuild our militari __PUNCT__ and take care of our veteran __PUNCT__
whether we continu to stand by as health care cost push more peopl into bankruptci and the number of uninsur keep rise __PUNCT__ or final guarante qualiti __PUNCT__ afford coverag to everi singl american __PUNCT__
whether we watch a gener of children graduat without the skill thei need to compet in a global economi __PUNCT__ or give all our children a world class educ __PUNCT__ from earli childhood all the wai to colleg __PUNCT__
whether we keep depend on dictat for our energi __PUNCT__ give billion in tax break to oil compani __PUNCT__ and destroi our planet in the process __PUNCT__ or decid that solv our energi crisi will be the great project of thi gener __PUNCT__
these ar the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
thi is what i think about when i get the chanc to tuck my girl in at night __PUNCT__
how i want my daughter __PUNCT__ and all our daughter __PUNCT__ to have no limit on their dream __PUNCT__ no obstacl to their achiev __PUNCT__ no opportun beyond their reach __PUNCT__
how i want them to have opportun their mother and grandmoth never could imagin __PUNCT__
we come so much closer to fulfil that goal becaus of the extraordinari woman with whom i share a stage so mani time dure thi campaign as an oppon __PUNCT__ and now have the privileg of do so as a partner __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ senat hillari clinton __PUNCT__
and i honor that all of you ar join us as we finish thi journei __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we turn the page on the fail polici of the past __PUNCT__
we bring new energi and new idea to meet the challeng we face __PUNCT__
we ensur that our daughter have the same right __PUNCT__ the same dream __PUNCT__ the same freedom to pursu their version of happi as our son __PUNCT__
and we won't just win an elect __PUNCT__ we will transform thi nation __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
