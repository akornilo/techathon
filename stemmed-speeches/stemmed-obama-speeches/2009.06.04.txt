i am honor to be in the timeless citi of cairo __PUNCT__ and to be host by two remark institut __PUNCT__
for over a thousand year __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ azhar ha stood as a beacon of islam learn __PUNCT__ and for over a centuri __PUNCT__ cairo univers ha been a sourc of egypt advanc __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ you repres the harmoni between tradit and progress __PUNCT__
i am grate for your hospit __PUNCT__ and the hospit of the peopl of egypt __PUNCT__
i am also proud to carri with me the goodwil of the american peopl __PUNCT__ and a greet of peac from muslim commun in my countri __PUNCT__ assalaamu alaykum __PUNCT__
we meet at a time of tension between the unit state and muslim around the world __PUNCT__ tension root in histor forc that go beyond ani current polici debat __PUNCT__
the relationship between islam and the west includ centuri of co __PUNCT__ exist and cooper __PUNCT__ but also conflict and religi war __PUNCT__
more recent __PUNCT__ tension ha been fed by coloni that deni right and opportun to mani muslim __PUNCT__ and a cold war in which muslim __PUNCT__ major countri were too often treat as proxi without regard to their own aspir __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ the sweep chang brought by modern and global led mani muslim to view the west as hostil to the tradit of islam __PUNCT__
a new begin
violent extremist have exploit these tension in a small but potent minor of muslim __PUNCT__
the attack of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ and the continu effort of these extremist to engag in violenc against civilian ha led some in my countri to view islam as inevit hostil not onli to america and western countri __PUNCT__ but also to human right __PUNCT__
thi ha bred more fear and mistrust __PUNCT__
so long as our relationship is defin by our differ __PUNCT__ we will empow those who sow hatr rather than peac __PUNCT__ and who promot conflict rather than the cooper that can help all of our peopl achiev justic and prosper __PUNCT__
thi cycl of suspicion and discord must end __PUNCT__
i have come here to seek a new begin between the unit state and muslim around the world __PUNCT__ on base upon mutual interest and mutual respect __PUNCT__ and on base upon the truth that america and islam ar not exclus __PUNCT__ and need not be in competit __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ thei overlap __PUNCT__ and share common principl __PUNCT__ principl of justic and progress __PUNCT__ toler and the digniti of all human be __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ no singl speech can erad year of mistrust __PUNCT__
i do so recogn that chang cannot happen overnight __PUNCT__
no singl speech can erad year of mistrust __PUNCT__ nor can i answer in the time that i have all the complex question that brought us to thi point __PUNCT__
but i am convinc that in order to move forward __PUNCT__ we must sai openli the thing we hold in our heart __PUNCT__ and that too often ar said onli behind close door __PUNCT__
there must be a sustain effort to listen to each other __PUNCT__ to learn from each other __PUNCT__ to respect on anoth __PUNCT__ and to seek common ground __PUNCT__
as the holi koran tell us __PUNCT__ be consciou of god and speak alwai the truth __PUNCT__ that is what i will try to do __PUNCT__ to speak the truth as best i can __PUNCT__ humbl by the task befor us __PUNCT__ and firm in my belief that the interest we share as human be ar far more power than the forc that drive us apart __PUNCT__
part of thi convict is root in my own experi __PUNCT__
i am a christian __PUNCT__ but my father came from a kenyan famili that includ gener of muslim __PUNCT__
as a boi __PUNCT__ i spent sever year in indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and the fall of dusk __PUNCT__
as a young man __PUNCT__ i work in chicago commun where mani found digniti and peac in their muslim faith __PUNCT__
as a student of histori __PUNCT__ i also know civil debt to islam __PUNCT__
it wa islam __PUNCT__ at place like al __PUNCT__ azhar univers __PUNCT__ that carri the light of learn through so mani centuri __PUNCT__ pave the wai for europ renaiss and enlighten __PUNCT__
it wa innov in muslim commun that develop the order of algebra __PUNCT__ our magnet compass and tool of navig __PUNCT__ our masteri of pen and print __PUNCT__ our understand of how diseas spread and how it can be heal __PUNCT__
islam cultur ha given us majest arch and soar spire __PUNCT__ timeless poetri and cherish music __PUNCT__ eleg calligraphi and place of peac contempl __PUNCT__
and throughout histori __PUNCT__ islam ha demonstr through word and deed the possibl of religi toler and racial equal __PUNCT__
i know __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ that islam ha alwai been a part of america stori __PUNCT__
the first nation to recogn my countri wa morocco __PUNCT__
in sign the treati of tripoli in __NUM__ our second presid john adam wrote __PUNCT__ the unit state ha in itself no charact of enmiti against the law __PUNCT__ religion or tranquil of muslim __PUNCT__
and sinc our found __PUNCT__ american muslim have enrich the unit state __PUNCT__
thei have fought in our war __PUNCT__ serv in govern __PUNCT__ stood for civil right __PUNCT__ start busi __PUNCT__ taught at our univers __PUNCT__ excel in our sport arena __PUNCT__ won nobel prize __PUNCT__ built our tallest build __PUNCT__ and lit the olymp torch __PUNCT__
and when the first muslim __PUNCT__ american wa recent elect to congress __PUNCT__ he took the oath to defend our constitut us the same holi koran that on of our found father __PUNCT__ thoma jefferson __PUNCT__ kept in hi person librari __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ islam is part of america __PUNCT__
so i have known islam on three contin befor come to the region where it wa first reveal __PUNCT__
that experi guid my convict that partnership between america and islam must be base on what islam is __PUNCT__ not what it isn't __PUNCT__
and i consid it part of my respons as presid of the unit state to fight against neg stereotyp of islam wherev thei appear __PUNCT__
but that same principl must appli to muslim percept of america __PUNCT__
just as muslim do not fit a crude stereotyp __PUNCT__ america is not the crude stereotyp of a self __PUNCT__ interest empir __PUNCT__
the unit state ha been on of the greatest sourc of progress that the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
we were born out of revolut against an empir __PUNCT__
we were found upon the ideal that all ar creat equal __PUNCT__ and we have shed blood and struggl for centuri to give mean to those word __PUNCT__ within our border __PUNCT__ and around the world __PUNCT__
we ar shape by everi cultur __PUNCT__ drawn from everi end of the earth __PUNCT__ and dedic to a simpl concept __PUNCT__ e pluribu unum __PUNCT__ out of mani __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__
much ha been made of the fact that an african __PUNCT__ american with the name barack hussein obama could be elect presid __PUNCT__
but my person stori is not so uniqu __PUNCT__
the dream of opportun for all peopl ha not come true for everyon in america __PUNCT__ but it promis exist for all who come to our shore __PUNCT__ that includ nearli seven million american muslim in our countri todai who enjoi incom and educ that ar higher than averag __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ freedom in america is indivis from the freedom to practic on religion __PUNCT__
that is why there is a mosqu in everi state of our union __PUNCT__ and over __NUM__ mosqu within our border __PUNCT__
that is why the u. __PUNCT__ govern ha gone to court to protect the right of women and girl to wear the hijab __PUNCT__ and to punish those who would deni it __PUNCT__
so let there be no doubt __PUNCT__ islam is a part of america __PUNCT__
and i believ that america hold within her the truth that regardless of race __PUNCT__ religion __PUNCT__ or station in life __PUNCT__ all of us share common aspir __PUNCT__ to live in peac and secur __PUNCT__ to get an educ and to work with digniti __PUNCT__ to love our famili __PUNCT__ our commun __PUNCT__ and our god __PUNCT__
these thing we share __PUNCT__
thi is the hope of all human __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ recogn our common human is onli the begin of our task __PUNCT__
word alon cannot meet the need of our peopl __PUNCT__
these need will be met onli if we act boldli in the year ahead __PUNCT__ and if we understand that the challeng we face ar share __PUNCT__ and our failur to meet them will hurt us all __PUNCT__
for we have learn from recent experi that when a financi system weaken in on countri __PUNCT__ prosper is hurt everywher __PUNCT__
when a new flu infect on human be __PUNCT__ all ar at risk __PUNCT__
when on nation pursu a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ the risk of nuclear attack rise for all nation __PUNCT__
when violent extremist oper in on stretch of mountain __PUNCT__ peopl ar endang across an ocean __PUNCT__
and when innoc in bosnia and darfur ar slaughter __PUNCT__ that is a stain on our collect conscienc __PUNCT__
that is what it mean to share thi world in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
that is the respons we have to on anoth as human be __PUNCT__
thi is a difficult respons to embrac __PUNCT__
for human histori ha often been a record of nation and tribe subjug on anoth to serv their own interest __PUNCT__
yet in thi new ag __PUNCT__ such attitud ar self __PUNCT__ defeat __PUNCT__
given our interdepend __PUNCT__ ani world order that elev on nation or group of peopl over anoth will inevit fail __PUNCT__
so whatev we think of the past __PUNCT__ we must not be prison of it __PUNCT__
our problem must be dealt with through partnership __PUNCT__ progress must be share __PUNCT__
that doe not mean we should ignor sourc of tension __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ it suggest the opposit __PUNCT__ we must face these tension squar __PUNCT__
and so in that spirit __PUNCT__ let me speak as clearli and plainli as i can about some specif issu that i believ we must final confront togeth __PUNCT__
confront extrem __PUNCT__ afghanistan
the first issu that we have to confront is violent extrem in all of it form __PUNCT__
in ankara __PUNCT__ i made clear that america is not __PUNCT__ and never will be __PUNCT__ at war with islam __PUNCT__
we will __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ relentlessli confront violent extremist who pose a grave threat to our secur __PUNCT__
becaus we reject the same thing that peopl of all faith reject __PUNCT__ the kill of innoc men __PUNCT__ women __PUNCT__ and children __PUNCT__
and it is my first duti as presid to protect the american peopl __PUNCT__
the situat in afghanistan demonstr america goal __PUNCT__ and our need to work togeth __PUNCT__
over seven year ago __PUNCT__ the unit state pursu al qaeda and the taliban with broad intern support __PUNCT__
we did not go by choic __PUNCT__ we went becaus of necess __PUNCT__
i am awar that some question or justifi the event of 9/11 __PUNCT__
but let us be clear __PUNCT__ al qaeda kill nearli __NUM__ peopl on that dai __PUNCT__
the victim were innoc men __PUNCT__ women and children from america and mani other nation who had done noth to harm anybodi __PUNCT__
and yet al qaeda chose to ruthlessli murder these peopl __PUNCT__ claim credit for the attack __PUNCT__ and even now state their determin to kill on a massiv scale __PUNCT__
thei have affili in mani countri and ar try to expand their reach __PUNCT__
these ar not opinion to be debat __PUNCT__ these ar fact to be dealt with __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ we do not want to keep our troop in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we seek no militari base there __PUNCT__
it is agon for america to lose our young men and women __PUNCT__
it is costli and polit difficult to continu thi conflict __PUNCT__
we would gladli bring everi singl on of our troop home if we could be confid that there were not violent extremist in afghanistan and pakistan determin to kill as mani american as thei possibl can __PUNCT__
but that is not yet the case __PUNCT__
that why we partner with a coalit of forti __PUNCT__ six countri __PUNCT__
and despit the cost involv __PUNCT__ america commit will not weaken __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ none of us should toler these extremist __PUNCT__
thei have kill in mani countri __PUNCT__
thei have kill peopl of differ faith __PUNCT__ more than ani other __PUNCT__ thei have kill muslim __PUNCT__
their action ar irreconcil with the right of human be __PUNCT__ the progress of nation __PUNCT__ and with islam __PUNCT__
the holi koran teach that whoever kill an innoc __PUNCT__ it is as if he ha kill all mankind __PUNCT__ and whoever save a person __PUNCT__ it is as if he ha save all mankind __PUNCT__
the endur faith of over a billion peopl is so much bigger than the narrow hatr of a few __PUNCT__
islam is not part of the problem in combat violent extrem __PUNCT__ it is an import part of promot peac __PUNCT__
we also know that militari power alon is not go to solv the problem in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
that is why we plan to invest __MONEY__ billion each year over the next five year to partner with pakistani to build school and hospit __PUNCT__ road and busi __PUNCT__ and hundr of million to help those who have been displac __PUNCT__
and that is why we ar provid more than __MONEY__ billion to help afghan develop their economi and deliv servic that peopl depend upon __PUNCT__
confront extrem __PUNCT__ iraq
let me also address the issu of iraq __PUNCT__
unlik afghanistan __PUNCT__ iraq wa a war of choic that provok strong differ in my countri and around the world __PUNCT__
although i believ that the iraqi peopl ar ultim better off without the tyranni of saddam hussein __PUNCT__ i also believ that event in iraq have remind america of the need to us diplomaci and build intern consensu to resolv our problem whenev possibl __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ we can recal the word of thoma jefferson __PUNCT__ who said __PUNCT__ i hope that our wisdom will grow with our power __PUNCT__ and teach us that the less we us our power the greater it will be __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ america ha a dual respons __PUNCT__ to help iraq forg a better futur __PUNCT__ and to leav iraq to iraqi __PUNCT__
i have made it clear to the iraqi peopl that we pursu no base __PUNCT__ and no claim on their territori or resourc __PUNCT__
iraq sovereignti is it own __PUNCT__
that is why i order the remov of our combat brigad by next __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that is why we will honor our agreement with iraq democrat __PUNCT__ elect govern to remov combat troop from iraqi citi by __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and to remov all our troop from iraq by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we will help iraq train it secur forc and develop it economi __PUNCT__
but we will support a secur and unit iraq as a partner __PUNCT__ and never as a patron __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ just as america can never toler violenc by extremist __PUNCT__ we must never alter our principl __PUNCT__
9/11 wa an enorm trauma to our countri __PUNCT__
the fear and anger that it provok wa understand __PUNCT__ but in some case __PUNCT__ it led us to act contrari to our ideal __PUNCT__
we ar take concret action to chang cours __PUNCT__
i have unequivoc prohibit the us of tortur by the unit state __PUNCT__ and i have order the prison at guantanamo bai close by earli next year __PUNCT__
so america will defend itself respect of the sovereignti of nation and the rule of law __PUNCT__
and we will do so in partnership with muslim commun which ar also threaten __PUNCT__
the sooner the extremist ar isol and unwelcom in muslim commun __PUNCT__ the sooner we will all be safer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the situat for the palestinian peopl is intoler __PUNCT__
the second major sourc of tension that we need to discuss is the situat between isra __PUNCT__ palestinian and the arab world __PUNCT__
america strong bond with israel ar well known __PUNCT__
thi bond is unbreak __PUNCT__
it is base upon cultur and histor ti __PUNCT__ and the recognit that the aspir for a jewish homeland is root in a tragic histori that cannot be deni __PUNCT__
around the world __PUNCT__ the jewish peopl were persecut for centuri __PUNCT__ and anti __PUNCT__ semit in europ culmin in an unpreced holocaust __PUNCT__
tomorrow __PUNCT__ i will visit buchenwald __PUNCT__ which wa part of a network of camp where jew were enslav __PUNCT__ tortur __PUNCT__ shot and gass to death by the third reich __PUNCT__
six million jew were kill __PUNCT__ more than the entir jewish popul of israel todai __PUNCT__
deni that fact is baseless __PUNCT__ ignor __PUNCT__ and hate __PUNCT__
threaten israel with destruct __PUNCT__ or repeat vile stereotyp about jew __PUNCT__ is deepli wrong __PUNCT__ and onli serv to evok in the mind of isra thi most pain of memori while prevent the peac that the peopl of thi region deserv __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ it is also undeni that the palestinian peopl __PUNCT__ muslim and christian __PUNCT__ have suffer in pursuit of a homeland __PUNCT__
for more than sixti year thei have endur the pain of disloc __PUNCT__
mani wait in refuge camp in the west bank __PUNCT__ gaza __PUNCT__ and neighbor land for a life of peac and secur that thei have never been abl to lead __PUNCT__
thei endur the daili humili __PUNCT__ larg and small __PUNCT__ that come with occup __PUNCT__
so let there be no doubt __PUNCT__ the situat for the palestinian peopl is intoler __PUNCT__
america will not turn our back on the legitim palestinian aspir for digniti __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ and a state of their own __PUNCT__
for decad __PUNCT__ there ha been a stalem __PUNCT__ two peopl with legitim aspir __PUNCT__ each with a pain histori that make compromis elus __PUNCT__
it is easi to point finger __PUNCT__ for palestinian to point to the displac brought by israel found __PUNCT__ and for isra to point to the constant hostil and attack throughout it histori from within it border as well as beyond __PUNCT__
but if we see thi conflict onli from on side or the other __PUNCT__ then we will be blind to the truth __PUNCT__ the onli resolut is for the aspir of both side to be met through two state __PUNCT__ where isra and palestinian each live in peac and secur __PUNCT__
that is in israel interest __PUNCT__ palestin interest __PUNCT__ america interest __PUNCT__ and the world interest __PUNCT__
that is why i intend to person pursu thi outcom with all the patienc that the task requir __PUNCT__
the oblig that the parti have agre to under the road map ar clear __PUNCT__
for peac to come __PUNCT__ it is time for them __PUNCT__ and all of us __PUNCT__ to live up to our respons __PUNCT__
palestinian __PUNCT__ abandon violenc
palestinian must abandon violenc __PUNCT__
resist through violenc and kill is wrong and doe not succe __PUNCT__
for centuri __PUNCT__ black peopl in america suffer the lash of the whip as slave and the humili of segreg __PUNCT__
but it wa not violenc that won full and equal right __PUNCT__
it wa a peac and determin insist upon the ideal at the center of america found __PUNCT__
thi same stori can be told by peopl from south africa to south asia __PUNCT__ from eastern europ to indonesia __PUNCT__
it a stori with a simpl truth __PUNCT__ that violenc is a dead end __PUNCT__
it is a sign of neither courag nor power to shoot rocket at sleep children __PUNCT__ or to blow up old women on a bu __PUNCT__
that is not how moral author is claim __PUNCT__ that is how it is surrend __PUNCT__
now is the time for palestinian to focu on what thei can build __PUNCT__
the palestinian author must develop it capac to govern __PUNCT__ with institut that serv the need of it peopl __PUNCT__
hama doe have support among some palestinian __PUNCT__ but thei also have respons __PUNCT__
to plai a role in fulfil palestinian aspir __PUNCT__ and to unifi the palestinian peopl __PUNCT__ hama must put an end to violenc __PUNCT__ recogn past agreement __PUNCT__ and recogn israel right to exist __PUNCT__
israel __PUNCT__ recogn palestin right to exist
at the same time __PUNCT__ isra must acknowledg that just as israel right to exist cannot be deni __PUNCT__ neither can palestin __PUNCT__
the unit state doe not accept the legitimaci of continu isra settlement __PUNCT__
thi construct violat previou agreement and undermin effort to achiev peac __PUNCT__
it is time for these settlement to stop __PUNCT__
israel must also live up to it oblig to ensur that palestinian can live __PUNCT__ and work __PUNCT__ and develop their societi __PUNCT__
and just as it devast palestinian famili __PUNCT__ the continu humanitarian crisi in gaza doe not serv israel secur __PUNCT__ neither doe the continu lack of opportun in the west bank __PUNCT__
progress in the daili live of the palestinian peopl must be part of a road to peac __PUNCT__ and israel must take concret step to enabl such progress __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ the arab state must recogn that the arab peac initi wa an import begin __PUNCT__ but not the end of their respons __PUNCT__
the arab __PUNCT__ isra conflict should no longer be us to distract the peopl of arab nation from other problem __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ it must be a caus for action to help the palestinian peopl develop the institut that will sustain their state __PUNCT__ to recogn israel legitimaci __PUNCT__ and to choos progress over a self __PUNCT__ defeat focu on the past __PUNCT__
america will align our polici with those who pursu peac __PUNCT__ and sai in public what we sai in privat to isra and palestinian and arab __PUNCT__
we cannot impos peac __PUNCT__
but privat __PUNCT__ mani muslim recogn that israel will not go awai __PUNCT__
likewis __PUNCT__ mani isra recogn the need for a palestinian state __PUNCT__
it is time for us to act on what everyon know to be true __PUNCT__
too mani tear have flow __PUNCT__
too much blood ha been shed __PUNCT__
all of us have a respons to work for the dai when the mother of isra and palestinian can see their children grow up without fear __PUNCT__ when the holi land of three great faith is the place of peac that god intend it to be __PUNCT__ when jerusalem is a secur and last home for jew and christian and muslim __PUNCT__ and a place for all of the children of abraham to mingl peacefulli togeth as in the stori of isra __PUNCT__ when mose __PUNCT__ jesu __PUNCT__ and moham __PUNCT__ peac be upon them __PUNCT__ join in prayer __PUNCT__
nuke and the middl east
the third sourc of tension is our share interest in the right and respons of nation on nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
thi issu ha been a sourc of tension between the unit state and the islam republ of iran __PUNCT__
for mani year __PUNCT__ iran ha defin itself in part by it opposit to my countri __PUNCT__ and there is inde a tumultu histori between us __PUNCT__
in the middl of the cold war __PUNCT__ the unit state plai a role in the overthrow of a democrat __PUNCT__ elect iranian govern __PUNCT__
sinc the islam revolut __PUNCT__ iran ha plai a role in act of hostag __PUNCT__ take and violenc against u. __PUNCT__ troop and civilian __PUNCT__
thi histori is well known __PUNCT__
rather than remain trap in the past __PUNCT__ i have made it clear to iran leader and peopl that my countri is prepar to move forward __PUNCT__
the question __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ is not what iran is against __PUNCT__ but rather what futur it want to build __PUNCT__
it will be hard to overcom decad of mistrust __PUNCT__ but we will proce with courag __PUNCT__ rectitud and resolv __PUNCT__
there will be mani issu to discuss between our two countri __PUNCT__ and we ar will to move forward without precondit on the basi of mutual respect __PUNCT__
but it is clear to all concern that when it come to nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ we have reach a decis point __PUNCT__
thi is not simpli about america interest __PUNCT__
it is about prevent a nuclear arm race in the middl east that could lead thi region and the world down a huge danger path __PUNCT__
i understand those who protest that some countri have weapon that other do not __PUNCT__
no singl nation should pick and choos which nation hold nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
that is why i strongli reaffirm america commit to seek a world in which no nation hold nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
and ani nation __PUNCT__ includ iran __PUNCT__ should have the right to access peac nuclear power if it compli with it respons under the nuclear non __PUNCT__ prolifer treati __PUNCT__
that commit is at the core of the treati __PUNCT__ and it must be kept for all who fulli abid by it __PUNCT__
and i am hope that all countri in the region can share in thi goal __PUNCT__
democraci in the middl east
the fourth issu that i will address is democraci __PUNCT__
i know there ha been controversi about the promot of democraci in recent year __PUNCT__ and much of thi controversi is connect to the war in iraq __PUNCT__
so let me be clear __PUNCT__ no system of govern can or should be impos upon on nation by ani other __PUNCT__
that doe not lessen my commit __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ to govern that reflect the will of the peopl __PUNCT__
each nation give life to thi principl in it own wai __PUNCT__ ground in the tradit of it own peopl __PUNCT__
america doe not presum to know what is best for everyon __PUNCT__ just as we would not presum to pick the outcom of a peac elect __PUNCT__
but i do have an unyield belief that all peopl yearn for certain thing __PUNCT__ the abil to speak your mind and have a sai in how you ar govern __PUNCT__ confid in the rule of law and the equal administr of justic __PUNCT__ govern that is transpar and doesn't steal from the peopl __PUNCT__ the freedom to live as you choos __PUNCT__
those ar not just american idea __PUNCT__ thei ar human right __PUNCT__ and that is why we will support them everywher __PUNCT__
there is no straight line to realiz thi promis __PUNCT__
but thi much is clear __PUNCT__ govern that protect these right ar ultim more stabl __PUNCT__ success and secur __PUNCT__
suppress idea never succe in make them go awai __PUNCT__
america respect the right of all peac and law __PUNCT__ abid voic to be heard around the world __PUNCT__ even if we disagre with them __PUNCT__
and we will welcom all elect __PUNCT__ peac govern __PUNCT__ provid thei govern with respect for all their peopl __PUNCT__
thi last point is import becaus there ar some who advoc for democraci onli when thei ar out of power __PUNCT__ onc in power __PUNCT__ thei ar ruthless in suppress the right of other __PUNCT__
no matter where it take hold __PUNCT__ govern of the peopl and by the peopl set a singl standard for all who hold power __PUNCT__ you must maintain your power through consent __PUNCT__ not coercion __PUNCT__ you must respect the right of minor __PUNCT__ and particip with a spirit of toler and compromis __PUNCT__ you must place the interest of your peopl and the legitim work of the polit process abov your parti __PUNCT__
without these ingredi __PUNCT__ elect alon do not make true democraci __PUNCT__
religi freedom
the fifth issu that we must address togeth is religi freedom __PUNCT__
islam ha a proud tradit of toler __PUNCT__
we see it in the histori of andalusia and cordoba dure the inquisit __PUNCT__
i saw it firsthand as a child in indonesia __PUNCT__ where devout christian worship freeli in an overwhelmingli muslim countri __PUNCT__
that is the spirit we need todai __PUNCT__
peopl in everi countri should be free to choos and live their faith base upon the persuas of the mind __PUNCT__ heart __PUNCT__ and soul __PUNCT__
thi toler is essenti for religion to thrive __PUNCT__ but it is be challeng in mani differ wai __PUNCT__
among some muslim __PUNCT__ there is a disturb tendenc to measur on own faith by the reject of anoth __PUNCT__
the rich of religi divers must be upheld __PUNCT__ whether it is for maronit in lebanon or the copt in egypt __PUNCT__
and fault line must be close among muslim as well __PUNCT__ as the divis between sunni and shia have led to tragic violenc __PUNCT__ particularli in iraq __PUNCT__
freedom of religion is central to the abil of peopl to live togeth __PUNCT__
we must alwai examin the wai in which we protect it __PUNCT__
for instanc __PUNCT__ in the unit state __PUNCT__ rule on charit give have made it harder for muslim to fulfil their religi oblig __PUNCT__
that is why i am commit to work with american muslim to ensur that thei can fulfil zakat __PUNCT__
likewis __PUNCT__ it is import for western countri to avoid imped muslim citizen from practic religion as thei see fit __PUNCT__ for instanc __PUNCT__ by dictat what cloth a muslim woman should wear __PUNCT__
we cannot disguis hostil toward ani religion behind the pretenc of liber __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ faith should bring us togeth __PUNCT__
that is why we ar forg servic project in america that bring togeth christian __PUNCT__ muslim __PUNCT__ and jew __PUNCT__
that is why we welcom effort like saudi arabian king abdullah interfaith dialogu and turkei leadership in the allianc of civil __PUNCT__
around the world __PUNCT__ we can turn dialogu into interfaith servic __PUNCT__ so bridg between peopl lead to action __PUNCT__ whether it is combat malaria in africa __PUNCT__ or provid relief after a natur disast __PUNCT__
women right
the sixth issu that i want to address is women right __PUNCT__
i know there is debat about thi issu __PUNCT__
i reject the view of some in the west that a woman who choos to cover her hair is somehow less equal __PUNCT__ but i do believ that a woman who is deni an educ is deni equal __PUNCT__
and it is no coincid that countri where women ar well __PUNCT__ educ ar far more like to be prosper __PUNCT__
now let me be clear __PUNCT__ issu of women equal ar by no mean simpli an issu for islam __PUNCT__
in turkei __PUNCT__ pakistan __PUNCT__ bangladesh and indonesia __PUNCT__ we have seen muslim __PUNCT__ major countri elect a woman to lead __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ the struggl for women equal continu in mani aspect of american life __PUNCT__ and in countri around the world __PUNCT__
our daughter can contribut just as much to societi as our son __PUNCT__ and our common prosper will be advanc by allow all human __PUNCT__ men and women __PUNCT__ to reach their full potenti __PUNCT__
i do not believ that women must make the same choic as men in order to be equal __PUNCT__ and i respect those women who choos to live their live in tradit role __PUNCT__
but it should be their choic __PUNCT__
that is why the unit state will partner with ani muslim __PUNCT__ major countri to support expand literaci for girl __PUNCT__ and to help young women pursu employ through micro __PUNCT__ financ that help peopl live their dream __PUNCT__
econom develop and opportun
final __PUNCT__ i want to discuss econom develop and opportun __PUNCT__
i know that for mani __PUNCT__ the face of global is contradictori __PUNCT__
the internet and televis can bring knowledg and inform __PUNCT__ but also offens sexual and mindless violenc __PUNCT__
trade can bring new wealth and opportun __PUNCT__ but also huge disrupt and chang commun __PUNCT__
in all nation __PUNCT__ includ my own __PUNCT__ thi chang can bring fear __PUNCT__
fear that becaus of modern we will lose of control over our econom choic __PUNCT__ our polit __PUNCT__ and most importantli our ident __PUNCT__ those thing we most cherish about our commun __PUNCT__ our famili __PUNCT__ our tradit __PUNCT__ and our faith __PUNCT__
but i also know that human progress cannot be deni __PUNCT__
there need not be contradict between develop and tradit __PUNCT__
countri like japan and south korea grew their economi while maintain distinct cultur __PUNCT__
the same is true for the astonish progress within muslim __PUNCT__ major countri from kuala lumpur to dubai __PUNCT__
in ancient time and in our time __PUNCT__ muslim commun have been at the forefront of innov and educ __PUNCT__
thi is import becaus no develop strategi can be base onli upon what come out of the ground __PUNCT__ nor can it be sustain while young peopl ar out of work __PUNCT__
mani gulf state have enjoi great wealth as a consequ of oil __PUNCT__ and some ar begin to focu it on broader develop __PUNCT__
but all of us must recogn that educ and innov will be the currenc of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and in too mani muslim commun there remain underinvest in these area __PUNCT__
i am emphas such invest within my countri __PUNCT__
and while america in the past ha focus on oil and ga in thi part of the world __PUNCT__ we now seek a broader engag __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ encourag more american to studi in muslim commun __PUNCT__
on educ __PUNCT__ we will expand exchang program __PUNCT__ and increas scholarship __PUNCT__ like the on that brought my father to america __PUNCT__ while encourag more american to studi in muslim commun __PUNCT__
and we will match promis muslim student with internship in america __PUNCT__ invest in on __PUNCT__ line learn for teacher and children around the world __PUNCT__ and creat a new onlin network __PUNCT__ so a teenag in kansa can commun instantli with a teenag in cairo __PUNCT__
on econom develop __PUNCT__ we will creat a new corp of busi volunt to partner with counterpart in muslim __PUNCT__ major countri __PUNCT__
and i will host a summit on entrepreneurship thi year to identifi how we can deepen ti between busi leader __PUNCT__ foundat and social entrepreneur in the unit state and muslim commun around the world __PUNCT__
on scienc and technolog __PUNCT__ we will launch a new fund to support technolog develop in muslim __PUNCT__ major countri __PUNCT__ and to help transfer idea to the marketplac so thei can creat job __PUNCT__
we will open center of scientif excel in africa __PUNCT__ the middl east and southeast asia __PUNCT__ and appoint new scienc envoi to collabor on program that develop new sourc of energi __PUNCT__ creat green job __PUNCT__ digit record __PUNCT__ clean water __PUNCT__ and grow new crop __PUNCT__
and todai i am announc a new global effort with the organ of the islam confer to erad polio __PUNCT__
and we will also expand partnership with muslim commun to promot child and matern health __PUNCT__
all these thing must be done in partnership __PUNCT__
american ar readi to join with citizen and govern __PUNCT__ commun organ __PUNCT__ religi leader __PUNCT__ and busi in muslim commun around the world to help our peopl pursu a better life __PUNCT__
the issu that i have describ will not be easi to address __PUNCT__
but we have a respons to join togeth on behalf of the world we seek __PUNCT__ a world where extremist no longer threaten our peopl __PUNCT__ and american troop have come home __PUNCT__ a world where isra and palestinian ar each secur in a state of their own __PUNCT__ and nuclear energi is us for peac purpos __PUNCT__ a world where govern serv their citizen __PUNCT__ and the right of all god children ar respect __PUNCT__
those ar mutual interest __PUNCT__
that is the world we seek __PUNCT__
but we can onli achiev it togeth __PUNCT__
counter the denier
i know there ar mani __PUNCT__ muslim and non __PUNCT__ muslim __PUNCT__ who question whether we can forg thi new begin __PUNCT__
some ar eager to stoke the flame of divis __PUNCT__ and to stand in the wai of progress __PUNCT__
some suggest that it isn't worth the effort __PUNCT__ that we ar fate to disagre __PUNCT__ and civil ar doom to clash __PUNCT__
mani more ar simpli skeptic that real chang can occur __PUNCT__
there is so much fear __PUNCT__ so much mistrust __PUNCT__
but if we choos to be bound by the past __PUNCT__ we will never move forward __PUNCT__
and i want to particularli sai thi to young peopl of everi faith __PUNCT__ in everi countri __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ more than anyon __PUNCT__ have the abil to remak thi world __PUNCT__
all of us share thi world for but a brief moment in time __PUNCT__
the question is whether we spend that time focus on what push us apart __PUNCT__ or whether we commit ourselv to an effort __PUNCT__ a sustain effort __PUNCT__ to find common ground __PUNCT__ to focu on the futur we seek for our children __PUNCT__ and to respect the digniti of all human be __PUNCT__
it is easier to start war than to end them __PUNCT__
it is easier to blame other than to look inward __PUNCT__ to see what is differ about someon than to find the thing we share __PUNCT__
but we should choos the right path __PUNCT__ not just the easi path __PUNCT__
there is also on rule that li at the heart of everi religion __PUNCT__ that we do unto other as we would have them do unto us __PUNCT__
thi truth transcend nation and peopl __PUNCT__ a belief that isn't new __PUNCT__ that isn't black or white or brown __PUNCT__ that isn't christian __PUNCT__ or muslim or jew __PUNCT__
it a belief that puls in the cradl of civil __PUNCT__ and that still beat in the heart of billion __PUNCT__
it a faith in other peopl __PUNCT__ and it what brought me here todai __PUNCT__
cite the three religion
we have the power to make the world we seek __PUNCT__ but onli if we have the courag to make a new begin __PUNCT__ keep in mind what ha been written __PUNCT__
the holi koran tell us __PUNCT__ o mankind __PUNCT__ we have creat you male and a femal __PUNCT__ and we have made you into nation and tribe so that you mai know on anoth __PUNCT__
the talmud tell us __PUNCT__ the whole of the torah is for the purpos of promot peac __PUNCT__
the holi bibl tell us __PUNCT__ bless ar the peacemak __PUNCT__ for thei shall be call son of god __PUNCT__
the peopl of the world can live togeth in peac __PUNCT__
we know that is god vision __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that must be our work here on earth __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
and mai god peac be upon you __PUNCT__
