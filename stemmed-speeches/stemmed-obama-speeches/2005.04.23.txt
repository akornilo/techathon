thank you __PUNCT__
it alwai great to be here in carbondal __PUNCT__ and a real honor to speak here at siuc first agricultur industri dai __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i be honest __PUNCT__ i haven't done all that much farm live on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__
but i have to sai __PUNCT__ my fondest farm memori is when i onc offer to help out a friend with hi harvest __PUNCT__
know the full rang of my agricultur experi and expertis __PUNCT__ he took on look at me and said __PUNCT__ no thank __PUNCT__
so when i saw that you gui need a keynot speaker for a lectur entitl __PUNCT__ grow the food __PUNCT__ agricultur __PUNCT__ and natur resourc economi in southern illinoi __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ sign me up __PUNCT__
but serious __PUNCT__ while i don't farm __PUNCT__ what i did do dure my eight year in the illinoi state senat __PUNCT__ and what i do now as a senat in washington __PUNCT__ is to constantli listen and learn from peopl who do farm and who do know the busi __PUNCT__
and that ha help me tremend in figur out how i can best stand up and speak out on the issu that matter to famili farmer and to the futur of agricultur in thi countri __PUNCT__
thank to all the hard work you do here at siu __PUNCT__ that futur hold more promis and more potenti for america with each pass dai __PUNCT__
becaus in a world where global ha made it possibl for a student in carbondal to share idea with on in calcutta __PUNCT__ yet necessari for them to compet for the same job __PUNCT__ the advanc you make in agricultur could lead to the breakthrough we need to maintain america global leadership in the year to come __PUNCT__
thi is our new challeng for the new centuri __PUNCT__ and it differ than anyth we ever face befor __PUNCT__
just think about what the world wa like onli fifti year ago __PUNCT__ when the colleg of agricultur wa a small __PUNCT__ five __PUNCT__ man depart that taught it student in a few old armi barrack __PUNCT__
back then __PUNCT__ the big challeng wa navig the soil found in the hill and vallei of southern illinoi __PUNCT__
if you could master that __PUNCT__ you were readi to graduat and live the farm life __PUNCT__ know that it would be enough to provid for you and your famili __PUNCT__
and even if you didn't go to a fine school like siu __PUNCT__ in those dai you still had a shot at the american dream __PUNCT__
becaus whether it wa on the farm or in a factori __PUNCT__ a middl __PUNCT__ class job that paid a decent wage and good benefit wa easi to come by __PUNCT__ and it would probabl last you a lifetim __PUNCT__
hard work and sacrific paid off for most famili __PUNCT__ and becaus of the wealth thei built __PUNCT__ america econom leadership wa unchalleng __PUNCT__
but the world ha certainli chang sinc then __PUNCT__ hasn't it __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ even a colleg degre doesn't guarante a middl __PUNCT__ class job that will support a famili __PUNCT__
what wors __PUNCT__ the cost of get that degre and the price of health care on that job ar rise higher and faster than ever befor __PUNCT__
famili farmer ar be squeez by big agribusi __PUNCT__ and factori job ar head across the ocean where labor is cheap __PUNCT__
we can make sure that the new job and new industri that take their place stai in america __PUNCT__ but it won't happen by itself __PUNCT__
countri like india and china ar churn out more and more qualifi colleg graduat who can compet directli with american for job that can now be done anywher in the world __PUNCT__
if we want to stai on top __PUNCT__ we need a nationwid commit to better educ __PUNCT__ better train __PUNCT__ and the research and discoveri that have alwai made america a land of innov and optim __PUNCT__
thi is where you gui come in __PUNCT__
the titl of thi lectur __PUNCT__ grow the food __PUNCT__ agricultur __PUNCT__ and natur resourc economi in southern illinoi __PUNCT__ is realli too narrow to captur the full potenti of the work you do here at the colleg of agricultur __PUNCT__
fifti year ago __PUNCT__ it mai have onli been about the economi in southern illinoi __PUNCT__
fifti year ago __PUNCT__ the work you do mai not have had an impact beyond the farm and border of a small town like carbondal __PUNCT__
but todai we live in a differ world __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ a discoveri made right here in your food and nutrit depart could save a person from a lifetim of diabet in southern california __PUNCT__
an siu student who publish a paper onlin about the benefit of soi in prevent prostat cancer could attract the attent of a research in boston who work on a cure __PUNCT__
and a professor who make a breakthrough in develop drought __PUNCT__ resist crop could save million from hunger in africa __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the work you do here not onli ha the potenti to improv the live of peopl in illinoi and across the world __PUNCT__ it offer the opportun to develop new idea that will lead to new job and a new competit edg for america in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
thi is the wai we can win in the global economi __PUNCT__ and here at thi school in thi illinoi small town __PUNCT__ you help us get there __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ research at thi colleg ar studi wai to improv the product and effici of ethanol __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ thi mai sound small __PUNCT__ but just imagin what thi could do for our countri __PUNCT__
ani of you who pull into a ga station late have notic how high the price ar get __PUNCT__
you might have decid to drive your car less __PUNCT__ or you might have notic that the cost of ga is cut into your famili budget __PUNCT__
the price of oil ha now climb to a record of over __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__ and we don't even know how much wors it go to get __PUNCT__
so what do we do about thi __PUNCT__
we onli have __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the world oil reserv __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our oil is import from the middl east __PUNCT__
so unless we want to stai depend forev on a region of the world that danger __PUNCT__ polit unstabl __PUNCT__ and will to do lord __PUNCT__ know __PUNCT__ what with the price of oil __PUNCT__ we must find new sourc of energi here in america __PUNCT__
it seem like politician have been sai thi forev __PUNCT__
but when you look at the record ga price __PUNCT__ and the possibl for more war and turmoil in the middl east __PUNCT__ it clear that we need less talk and more action __PUNCT__
we can start by produc more ethanol in america __PUNCT__
the futur of energi in thi countri doesn't have to remain in the desert of the middl east __PUNCT__ we can find it in the corn field of illinoi and across the midwest __PUNCT__
imagin run our car with a fuel we can liter grow as much as we want of __PUNCT__
imagin us a fuel that clean and healthi __PUNCT__ that sell for __NUM__ cent cheaper than gasolin __PUNCT__ and that place america energi need in america hand __PUNCT__
thi kind of futur is here __PUNCT__ but to expand ethanol promis across the nation __PUNCT__ you gui need to keep up the great research here and we need to step up the legisl process in washington __PUNCT__
recent __PUNCT__ i join a few other senat in introduc a bill that would increas america renew fuel standard and increas ethanol product along with it __PUNCT__
a bill like thi that alreadi pass the senat twice would provid us with __NUM__ barrel a dai of refin ethanol for us in gasolin and would save us __MONEY__ billion everi year in import oil and gasolin cost __PUNCT__
just think of what thi would do for our economi __PUNCT__
farmer would earn more for their corn __PUNCT__ busi would invest more in the type of commun __PUNCT__ size ethanol facil that would grow the downstat economi __PUNCT__ and over __NUM__ job would be creat __PUNCT__
we got bipartisan support for thi bill __PUNCT__ so i pretti confid that thi is the year we final go to get it done __PUNCT__
the other ethanol bill i introduc would make it easier for more car to be power by cheaper __PUNCT__ cleaner __PUNCT__ ethanol __PUNCT__ base fuel __PUNCT__
as most of you probabl know __PUNCT__ there a fuel known as e85 that made from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ ethanol and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ gasolin __PUNCT__
it a great altern to gasolin __PUNCT__ but the onli problem is that we in short suppli of e85 fuel station __PUNCT__
down here in southern illinoi __PUNCT__ you drive by mile and mile of corn field that can produc ethanol __PUNCT__ but onli __NUM__ e85 station in all of southern illinoi __PUNCT__ and not on in carbondal __PUNCT__
so the bill i sponsor would provid a tax credit of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to anyon who want to build an e85 fuel station __PUNCT__
and to give consum a good deal too __PUNCT__ it provid a tax credit of __NUM__ cent per gallon of e85 fuel __PUNCT__
we talk for too long about energi independ in thi countri __PUNCT__ and i think these propos final give us an opportun to do someth about it __PUNCT__
you all been do your part here at siu __PUNCT__ and it high time for washington to do our part __PUNCT__
i alwai believ that the incred stori of progress that is america ha been built by those who ask why __PUNCT__ what if __PUNCT__ and why not __PUNCT__ question ask by the veri student at thi colleg everi dai thei choos to confront the challeng of thi new centuri __PUNCT__
it is thi fundament charact of the american spirit __PUNCT__ the desir to move forward __PUNCT__ look around the next corner __PUNCT__ and reach for the unreach __PUNCT__ that put the first man on the moon __PUNCT__ led to a cure for polio __PUNCT__ and launch the technolog revolut of the nineti __PUNCT__
and as the colleg of agricultur look ahead to it next fifti year __PUNCT__ we do well to ask ourselv __PUNCT__ what will thei sai about us at the __NUM__ anniversari __PUNCT__ as we face a new and differ world that bring both great promis and great peril __PUNCT__ what will we do move america toward a new and better dai __PUNCT__
you won't find the answer from your professor __PUNCT__ and certainli not from politician __PUNCT__
you find them by continu to ask yourselv those question __PUNCT__ why __PUNCT__ what if __PUNCT__ and why not __PUNCT__
and as you keep studi and research here at school __PUNCT__ rememb that the answer you discov will not onli have an impact where you live and learn __PUNCT__ but across a world that is just wait to hear from the next gener of dreamer __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
