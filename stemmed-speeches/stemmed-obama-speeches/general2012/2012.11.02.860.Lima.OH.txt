and we don't want suddenli a bunch of ad sai stuff that not true __PUNCT__
you don't scare hard __PUNCT__ work american just to scare up some vote __PUNCT__

and that paid off in lordstown __PUNCT__ in toledo __PUNCT__ where compani ar creat new auto job __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__ right here in ohio __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
