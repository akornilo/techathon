somebodi just said __PUNCT__ it true __PUNCT__ at the state fair __PUNCT__ instead of sai __NUM__ more year __PUNCT__ thei were sai __PUNCT__ four more beer __PUNCT__
so i bought him four more beer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ told him he had to regist to vote __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ to get on of the beer __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__
it is __PUNCT__ the reason i back __PUNCT__ other than i just love be in iowa __PUNCT__ the reason i back is becaus that journei we start in __NUM__ we not finish yet __PUNCT__
so just like we did in __NUM__ we start over in council bluff __PUNCT__ and we ar drive all the wai to the quad __PUNCT__
and we want to make sure that everybodi understand the choic that you face in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and thi choic could not be bigger __PUNCT__ becaus it not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__ it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
more than ani recent elect __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ vision of where we need to go as a countri __PUNCT__
and the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ that go to have an impact not just on your live __PUNCT__ it will have an impact on your children and your grandchildren for decad to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ rememb why we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and it wa democrat and independ __PUNCT__ but it wa also some republican __PUNCT__
it wa becaus we saw that the basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__ that creat the most prosper economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__ that basic bargain wasn't be met __PUNCT__
and let me tell you what that bargain is __PUNCT__
it sai that if you work hard __PUNCT__ your work should be reward __PUNCT__
it sai that if you act respons and you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ you can find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you can have a home that you call your own __PUNCT__
you won't go broke just becaus somebodi in your famili get sick __PUNCT__
you can retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most importantli __PUNCT__ you can give your kid a great educ so thei can dream even bigger and do even better than you did __PUNCT__
that is the american promis __PUNCT__
that is what made thi countri great __PUNCT__
but the problem wa for a decad we had seen that bargain wasn't be met __PUNCT__
the promis wasn't be kept __PUNCT__
so we had seen a decad in which job were be ship oversea and wage and incom for work peopl were go down __PUNCT__ even though folk at the veri top were do veri well __PUNCT__ and the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__
we ran two war on a credit card __PUNCT__
we went from surplu to deficit __PUNCT__
so when i walk into offic we alreadi had a __MONEY__ trillion deficit __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
that the track record of the other parti the last time thei were in charg __PUNCT__
and we knew that restor the bargain that made thi countri great would not be easi __PUNCT__
it wa go to take more than on year or on term or even more than on presid __PUNCT__ but we knew we had to get start __PUNCT__
and obvious it becam that much harder when the middl class wa hammer by thi crisi becaus a lot of folk lost job __PUNCT__ lost home __PUNCT__ lost save __PUNCT__ and that american dream seem even further out of reach __PUNCT__
but i told you there wouldn't be ani quick fix __PUNCT__ there wouldn't be ani easi solut __PUNCT__ but what i also promis you __PUNCT__ and i absolut believ thi __PUNCT__ is we got everyth we need to meet our challeng __PUNCT__
waterloo __PUNCT__ we still got the best worker in the world and the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and the best research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best farmer in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
we ar still a young nation __PUNCT__ full of promis __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay sai __PUNCT__ no matter how dark thei try to paint thing when thei run against me in an elect __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
becaus peopl around the world still believ that america is the place where __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ you can still make it __PUNCT__
that the idea that we ar run to rebuild __PUNCT__
that is the campaign __PUNCT__
that is what my presid is about __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ waterloo __PUNCT__ what is __PUNCT__ there is on thing stand in our wai __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__
is that __PUNCT__ is strang polit in washington __PUNCT__
you got a parti that sai compromis is a dirti word __PUNCT__
folk who want to go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
you mai have heard __PUNCT__ my oppon chose as hi run mate congressman ryan thi weekend and __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ i know congressman ryan __PUNCT__
he is a decent man __PUNCT__
he is a famili man __PUNCT__
he is the ideolog leader of the republican in congress __PUNCT__
and he an articul spokesperson for governor romnei vision __PUNCT__
the problem is __PUNCT__ hi vision is wrong __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ my oppon __PUNCT__ governor romnei __PUNCT__ and hi friend in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ __PUNCT__ thi is their whole platform __PUNCT__ thi is their basic plan __PUNCT__ as much detail as you get __PUNCT__ thi is what you get __PUNCT__
their plan to grow the economi is to elimin regul __PUNCT__ includ on big bank and insur compani __PUNCT__ some of the regul we put in place to make sure __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ that we don't have anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout __PUNCT__
so he want to get rid of regul __PUNCT__ and then what he want to do is give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
and the idea __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ is that job and prosper will trickl down on everybodi __PUNCT__
that the centerpiec of hi plan __PUNCT__
you can go on hi web site __PUNCT__
hi econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ these ar the same folk who sai the deficit is our biggest problem __PUNCT__ but thei want to pass a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ that with a __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so just to give you some perspect __PUNCT__ our annual defens budget __PUNCT__ everyth we spend on nation secur __PUNCT__ is just a littl over __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
so thi would be __PUNCT__ everi year for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ a tax cut as big as our defens spend __PUNCT__
and here the kicker __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ he sai he go to pai for it __PUNCT__
so peopl ask __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how ar you go to pai for it __PUNCT__ it turn out that he expect you to pai for it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
he expect middl class famili to pick up the tab __PUNCT__
governor romnei plan __PUNCT__ accord to independ analyst __PUNCT__ would actual rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ thi is not __MONEY__ to reduc the deficit or creat job or build new school or help kid go to colleg or send a man to the moon __PUNCT__
thi is __MONEY__ each that you have to pai to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to folk who ar make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
that crazi __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i not make thi stuff up __PUNCT__
you can look __PUNCT__ look on their web site __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__ we tri thi befor __PUNCT__
we tri thi trickl __PUNCT__ down fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to lower the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
we do not need more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
we need to give tax relief to work famili who ar try to rais their kid __PUNCT__ keep them healthi __PUNCT__ send them to colleg __PUNCT__ keep a roof over their head __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that on of the reason i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ waterloo __PUNCT__ i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i came into offic __PUNCT__
i promis to cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__
that exactli what i done __PUNCT__ by a total of about __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
so if you talk to somebodi who is still not convinc and undecid in the elect __PUNCT__ you tell them your tax ar lower __PUNCT__
your feder tax ar lower now than when i came into offic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what i want to do is i want to keep everybodi tax right there where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of famili do __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ percent of small busi do __PUNCT__ then you won't see your incom tax go up by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__ not on dime __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ like i am __PUNCT__ you still get a tax break on your first __MONEY__
but for the amount that you make over that __PUNCT__ we ask you to contribut a littl bit more so we can pai down our deficit without gut educ __PUNCT__ without get rid of transport project __PUNCT__ without gut all the thing that help make america grow __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ i make sure govern still doe it part to reduc our debt and our deficit __PUNCT__
we cut out alreadi a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend we don't need __PUNCT__
and we can do more __PUNCT__
i want to make govern effici __PUNCT__
we got to make sure that your tax dollar ar be well spent __PUNCT__
but we can't bring down our deficit and our debt just by ask us to get rid of the thing that help open up opportun to american __PUNCT__
so instead __PUNCT__ we ask folk like me to go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ wa a time when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ waterloo __PUNCT__ thi come down to your basic philosophi __PUNCT__
but also __PUNCT__ when you look at the evid of our econom histori __PUNCT__ when teacher and nurs and firefight and receptionist and construct worker __PUNCT__ when you got a littl more monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ you spend it becaus time ar tight __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ so if you got a littl extra monei __PUNCT__ now mayb you final trade in that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car you been drive __PUNCT__
mayb you bui a comput for your kid who is about to go to colleg __PUNCT__
so suddenli busi have more custom __PUNCT__ which mean thei make more profit __PUNCT__ which mean thei hire more worker __PUNCT__ who then spend more monei __PUNCT__ and suddenli the economi get better for everybodi __PUNCT__ includ folk at the top __PUNCT__
i don't believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
i believ in middl class out econom __PUNCT__
i believ in bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
i believ in make sure everybodi ha got a fair shot __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ that not the onli differ between me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ do you rememb that __PUNCT__ more than a million job at stake __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and manag and worker got togeth in a great __PUNCT__ icon american industri __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ three year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri is roar back __PUNCT__
i want to see high __PUNCT__ tech advanc manufactur come back all across america in other industri __PUNCT__
i don't want those job in china or germani __PUNCT__
i want them here in iowa __PUNCT__
governor romnei sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i understand the economi becaus i been in the privat sector __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ a lot of that experi wa invest in compani __PUNCT__ includ those that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ in the busi of outsourc __PUNCT__
he want to keep give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to end those tax break onc and for all and start reward compani that ar invest right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ make american product __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that not the onli differ __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we see homegrown energi __PUNCT__ new sourc of energi __PUNCT__ creat job right here in iowa __PUNCT__
so what doe governor romnei want to do __PUNCT__ he want to end the tax credit for wind energi produc __PUNCT__
he said these new sourc of energi ar __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
congressman ryan __PUNCT__ hi run mate __PUNCT__ call them a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
dure a speech a few month ago __PUNCT__ governor romnei even explain hi energi polici __PUNCT__
thi is what he said __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ you can't drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that what he said about wind power __PUNCT__ you can't drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ mayb he tri it __PUNCT__ he put other thing on the roof __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but if he realli want to learn someth about wind energi __PUNCT__ he should come to iowa __PUNCT__
then he know that __NUM__ iowa job depend on the wind industri __PUNCT__ more than ani other state in america __PUNCT__
these job aren't a fad __PUNCT__ thei our futur __PUNCT__
he know that the part for make these high __PUNCT__ tech wind turbin __PUNCT__ thei now made in iowa __PUNCT__
thei made in america __PUNCT__
that not imaginari __PUNCT__
i been to the place in newton __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__ where some of thi stuff is be made __PUNCT__
i understand he mai not have figur out how to drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__ but if he came to iowa __PUNCT__ he know that __NUM__ percent of iowa electr now come from wind energi __PUNCT__
america ha doubl the amount of electr we get from wind over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ enough power for nearli __NUM__ million home __PUNCT__ clean __PUNCT__ renew energi __PUNCT__
that someth you leav behind for the next gener __PUNCT__
that is worth fight for __PUNCT__
there ar __NUM__ american job at stake in thi wind energi tax credit __PUNCT__
we should support it __PUNCT__ i support it __PUNCT__
and instead of give __MONEY__ billion in taxpay subsidi to oil compani that ar make plenti of monei everi time you go to the pump __PUNCT__ we should be invest in homegrown energi that never been more promis __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i not done yet __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
i end it __PUNCT__
governor romnei said the wai i end it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__
i said i go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__
i went after them __PUNCT__
we now begin a transit out of afghanistan __PUNCT__
and so all of thi is possibl onli becaus of the extraordinari servic of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
and that why i made sure to make histor invest in the va __PUNCT__
becaus somebodi who ha fought for us shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about them come home to a strong economi __PUNCT__ then we got to do some build here at home __PUNCT__ some nation __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__ take half of the monei that we been spend over a decad of war __PUNCT__
and let start do some rebuild here in america __PUNCT__
let put american back to work rebuild road and bridg and port and airport __PUNCT__ lai broadband line in rural commun __PUNCT__
let creat a veteran job corp so return hero can get job as firefight and cop in commun that need them __PUNCT__
there a lot of work to be done right here in america __PUNCT__ and i run to rebuild america __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and i run to make sure america onc again ha the best educ system in the world and the best train system for worker in the world __PUNCT__
i want to help our school hire and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg to train for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
i want to get colleg and univers to bring down the cost of tuition so that everi young person can get the kind of educ that thei need to succe in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
i want to help homeown refin their home __PUNCT__ save __NUM__ buck at these histor low rate __PUNCT__
governor romnei think we should just let the hous market bottom out __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
i believ that you should have some health care secur __PUNCT__
that why i pass obamacar __PUNCT__
and i like obamacar __PUNCT__
i like the phrase obamacar becaus you know what __PUNCT__ i do care __PUNCT__
i care about the __PUNCT__ i care about all those folk with preexist condit who now ar go to be abl to get coverag __PUNCT__
i care about folk who alreadi have insur __PUNCT__ make sure insur compani don't jerk them around right when thei need that insur the most __PUNCT__
i care about the 6½ million young peopl who ar now abl to stai on their parent plan and don't have to go without insur __PUNCT__
i care about the senior who now have more discount on their prescript drug __PUNCT__ and we close the doughnut hole __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ waterloo __PUNCT__ we don't need anoth __NUM__ year of argu about health care __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar implement thi law __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
we not move backward __PUNCT__
all these thing __PUNCT__ health care secur __PUNCT__ american manufactur __PUNCT__ rebuild america __PUNCT__ put construct worker back to work __PUNCT__ make sure our kid ar get a great educ and can afford colleg __PUNCT__ all these thing that make up a middl class life __PUNCT__ thei all tie togeth __PUNCT__
it goe back to that central idea of america __PUNCT__ that here in thi countri everybodi get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi doe their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
it the same promis our parent and grandpar pass on to us __PUNCT__ and now __PUNCT__ our job is to pass it on to our kid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side will spend more monei than we have ever seen __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you notic their ad gener don't tell you what it is that thei go to do becaus thei know their plan won't sell __PUNCT__
you haven't forgotten __PUNCT__ you didn't get amnesia __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you didn't forget the last time thei tri what thei sell __PUNCT__
so basic __PUNCT__ the argument that thei go to make over and over again is just the same on __PUNCT__ which is the economi is still not where it need to be and it obama fault __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it need to be __PUNCT__
we still got too mani folk out of work and too mani home under water __PUNCT__
and we haven't brought back all the job that need to be brought back __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ what thei offer __PUNCT__ it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
the plan i put forward can do that __PUNCT__
but i need your help __PUNCT__ i need your help __PUNCT__ i need your help __PUNCT__
your friend have to be regist __PUNCT__
your famili ha to be regist __PUNCT__
you can get a voter registr form onlin __PUNCT__
just go to __URL__
thi is not __URL__ thi is g __PUNCT__ o __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ a regist __PUNCT__ __URL__ __PUNCT__
gotta regist becaus we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
we been outspent befor __PUNCT__
i been count out befor __PUNCT__
but here what i know __PUNCT__
when all of you decid to mobil and organ __PUNCT__ and when you focu on those valu that ar best in america __PUNCT__ when you rememb the stori of your famili and your parent __PUNCT__ your grandpar __PUNCT__ the hard work __PUNCT__ the sacrific __PUNCT__ recogn sometim time ar tough and sometim we get knock down __PUNCT__ but we get back up __PUNCT__ we ar determin __PUNCT__ we ar tougher than ani tough time __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ that remind that when we do thing togeth __PUNCT__ when we focus on how we build thi countri togeth __PUNCT__ we can't be stop __PUNCT__
that more power than ani monei __PUNCT__
that more power than ani tv commerci __PUNCT__
so we got to keep on go becaus we got too mani school we still need to build __PUNCT__ too mani teacher we still need to hire __PUNCT__ too mani kid we still need to send to colleg __PUNCT__
we got too mani road we still need to build __PUNCT__ too much energi we still got to gener right here at home __PUNCT__ too mani troop we got to bring home __PUNCT__ too mani door of opportun that we got to open up for everi young person who will to make the effort __PUNCT__
that what at stake right now __PUNCT__
and if you will to stand with me and work with me and vote for me __PUNCT__ we will win iowa __PUNCT__
we will win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and we will finish what we start and remind the world why america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__ god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
