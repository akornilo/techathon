__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and part of the reason the campaign is so intens is becaus the choic we face in __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__ it is a choic between two fundament differ vision about where to take the countri __PUNCT__ two fundament differ path for america __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
there you go __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the idea wa that we need to restor the basic bargain that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ the basic bargain that creat the most prosper economi that the world ha even known __PUNCT__
and it a simpl bargain __PUNCT__
it sai __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ that work should be reward __PUNCT__
it sai that if you put in enough effort and you take serious your respons __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ you should be abl to afford a home you can call your own __PUNCT__ you should count on health care if you get sick __PUNCT__ you should be abl to retir with some digniti and some respect after a lifetim of labor __PUNCT__ and most import __PUNCT__ you should be abl to give your kid the kind of educ and opportun that allow them to dream bigger and do better than you ever did __PUNCT__
that the american promis __PUNCT__
that the american dream __PUNCT__
and we knew restor it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__ that it would take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__ becaus we had gone through a decad in which that promis wa not be kept __PUNCT__
we had seen a decad in which incom and wage were go down even as the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
sai it again __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ so we can hear it again __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

and middl class famili who were alreadi get hammer lost their job __PUNCT__ lost their save __PUNCT__ some lost their home __PUNCT__
and the american dream seem even further out of reach __PUNCT__
so when i ran for offic __PUNCT__ i told you there ar no quick fix __PUNCT__ there ar no easi solut __PUNCT__
but what i also insist wa that if we pull togeth __PUNCT__ we have everyth we need to meet our challeng __PUNCT__

there a reason why peopl still want to come here __PUNCT__
becaus no matter what the naysay sai and no matter how stark the other side tri to paint the situat dure elect time __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't gladli chang place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ the american charact ha not chang __PUNCT__

that how we creat 4Â½ million new job __PUNCT__ half a million in manufactur __PUNCT__
we ar not there yet __PUNCT__
we still got a long wai to go __PUNCT__ becaus we got to make sure that here in america __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__

we got a particular vision about how to move the countri forward __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi run mate have a veri differ view __PUNCT__
thei believ the best wai forward is to go right back to the old top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei __PUNCT__ their idea ar pretti simpl __PUNCT__ thei not hard to explain __PUNCT__
thei think that if we get rid of more regul on big corpor and big bank __PUNCT__ some of which we put in place to prevent anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout __PUNCT__ and if we do more tax cut for the veri wealthiest american __PUNCT__ then somehow prosper is go to rain down on all of you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that their theori __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of my oppon entir econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
hi new run mate __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ he put forward __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ he put forward a plan that would let governor romnei pai less than __NUM__ percent in tax each year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ and here the kicker __PUNCT__ he expect you to pick up the tab __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
governor romnei tax plan __PUNCT__ thi is not my analysi now __PUNCT__ thi is the analysi of independ folk who analyz tax plan for a live __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that what thei do __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ their analysi show that governor romnei tax plan would actual rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ not to grow job __PUNCT__ not to invest in educ __PUNCT__ but to give anoth tax cut to folk like him __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ask governor romnei and hi run mate when thei here in new hampshir on mondai __PUNCT__ thei go to be come here on mondai __PUNCT__ ask him if that fair __PUNCT__
ask him how it will grow the economi __PUNCT__
ask him how it will strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__
thei have been try to sell thi trickl __PUNCT__ down snake oil befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it did not work then __PUNCT__
it will not work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it will not reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
it will not move the economi forward __PUNCT__
it the wrong direct for america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the truth is __PUNCT__ i think thei know it not a veri popular idea __PUNCT__
you can tell that becaus now thei be dishonest about my plan __PUNCT__ sinc thei can't sell their plan __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ thei ar try to throw everyth at the wall just to see what will stick __PUNCT__
the latest thing thei been try is to talk about medicar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you think thei avoid talk about medicar __PUNCT__ given the fact that both of them have propos to voucher the medicar system __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but i guess thei figur the best defens is to try to go on offens __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ here what you need to know __PUNCT__ sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__ i have strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
i made reform that have extend the life of the program __PUNCT__ that have save million of senior with medicar hundr of dollar on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
the onli chang to your benefit that i made on medicar is that medicar now cover new prevent servic like cancer screen and well visit for free __PUNCT__
governor romnei and congressman ryan have a veri differ plan __PUNCT__
what thei want to do is thei want senior to get a voucher to bui their own insur __PUNCT__ which could forc senior to pai an extra __MONEY__ a year for their health care __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ thi is not my estim __PUNCT__
rememb those gui who analyz these thing for a live __PUNCT__ that their assess __PUNCT__
that doesn't strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
that undo the veri guarante of medicar __PUNCT__
that the core of the plan written by congressman ryan and endors by governor romnei __PUNCT__
so here the bottom line __PUNCT__ my plan save monei in medicar by crack down on fraud and wast and insur compani subsidi __PUNCT__
and their plan make senior pai more so thei can give anoth tax cut to millionair and billionair __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
my plan alreadi extend the life of medicar by nearli a decad __PUNCT__
their plan would put medicar on track to be end as we know it __PUNCT__
it would be an entir differ plan __PUNCT__ a plan in which you could not count on health care becaus it would have to be come out of your pocket __PUNCT__
that the real differ between our plan on medicar __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and i need your help __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__
that exactli what i done __PUNCT__ by a total of about __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
so just like we got a differ on medicar __PUNCT__ we got a differ on tax __PUNCT__
right now what i want to do is keep tax right where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make under __MONEY__ which __PUNCT__ that includ __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
that me __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ nineti __PUNCT__ seven percent of small busi __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still keep your tax cut on the first __MONEY__ you make __PUNCT__
that a pretti good deal __PUNCT__
but all we ask is for folk like me who make more than __NUM__ we ask that you contribut a littl bit more abov __NUM__ so we can pai down thi deficit and invest in thing like make colleg more afford __PUNCT__ make sure our teacher aren't laid off __PUNCT__ make sure our firefight ar there to respond to emerg __PUNCT__ make sure our economi grow __PUNCT__
and keep in mind __PUNCT__ ask the wealthi to pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ that doesn't elimin our deficit __PUNCT__
we still go to have to make sure that govern doe it part by cut awai all the spend we don't need __PUNCT__
and i alreadi cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__ and we slate anoth trillion more __PUNCT__
but we can't just reduc our deficit and our debt by gut educ and gut research and develop and gut infrastructur __PUNCT__
and all we ask folk like me to do is go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ wa a time when we creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and a bunch of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i get all fire up __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ and i want to explain that thi is not just good for middl class famili and work famili __PUNCT__ it good for everybodi __PUNCT__
becaus what happen when a polic offic or a firefight or a teacher or a construct worker or a receptionist __PUNCT__ what happen when thei got a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
thei spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei spend it on basic necess __PUNCT__
so mayb thei go out and final __PUNCT__ after __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ bui a new car __PUNCT__
or mayb thei bui a new comput for their kid who go off to colleg __PUNCT__
and that mean busi suddenli ha more custom __PUNCT__
and that mean busi ar make more profit __PUNCT__
and that mean busi ar hire more worker __PUNCT__ who in turn have more monei to spend __PUNCT__ which make busi do even better __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl out and from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
on issu after issu __PUNCT__ the choic could not be clearer __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the verg of collaps __PUNCT__ governor romnei said let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ a million job ar at stake __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker and american manufactur __PUNCT__
and 3Â½ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
governor romnei like to tout hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__ even though a lot of that experi wa invest in compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ in the busi of outsourc manufactur job __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

i said we go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
we now ar transit so that afghan take more respons for their secur and we can start bring our troop home from there __PUNCT__
all of these thing we did onli becaus of the incred courag and dedic and patriot of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
and that why we made histor invest in the va __PUNCT__ becaus i believ that anybodi who ha fought for america in uniform should not have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__ shouldn't have to fight for the benefit thei earn __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

on issu after issu __PUNCT__ there is a choic __PUNCT__
and all these issu __PUNCT__ manufactur and health care and educ __PUNCT__ all these thing tie togeth becaus it part of what not onli make up a middl class life __PUNCT__ but also creat rung of opportun for peopl to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
that what we believ in __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that how the economi grow __PUNCT__

thei just keep on repeat that becaus thei know their own plan don't sell __PUNCT__
so all thei try to do is just hope that if thei can tap into peopl frustrat and anxieti __PUNCT__ that somehow thei go to win __PUNCT__ even though what thei sell won't work __PUNCT__
it not a __PUNCT__ what thei sell is not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__ it not a plan to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ it certainli is not a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
