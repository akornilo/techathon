__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but it got __PUNCT__ and becaus of that __PUNCT__ you start feel a littl nostalg and you start think about some of your first campaign __PUNCT__
i think about all the place i us to travel in illinoi and the first race i ran as a state senat __PUNCT__
and michel and i had to __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ xerox or go to kinko and copi our littl flyer __PUNCT__ and we didn't have a tv budget back then __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and we rode around in my car __PUNCT__ and i fill it up with my ga __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i the on who got lost if i took a wrong turn __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and what amaz __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ when i think about it __PUNCT__ wa how mani peopl you meet from everi walk of life all across illinoi __PUNCT__ in big citi __PUNCT__ small town __PUNCT__ upstat __PUNCT__ downstat __PUNCT__ quad __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__ and you alwai hear similar stori from peopl about their parent or their grandpar and the struggl thei had gone through and how thei had been abl to find a job that paid a live wage and look after their famili and their kid had done a littl better than thei did __PUNCT__
and those stori would reson with me and michel becaus that wa our stori __PUNCT__ that wa our live __PUNCT__
and then when i came to iowa for the presidenti campaign __PUNCT__ first stop __PUNCT__ cedar rapid __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ first stop __PUNCT__
first stop __PUNCT__
cedar __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__
and the first stop wa cedar rapid __PUNCT__ and then we went on to waterloo __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ that wa the first time i had campaign as presid __PUNCT__ and i wa kind of nervou __PUNCT__
we had thi huge town hall __PUNCT__ and i don't rememb what i said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ most of the time i wa just worri about screw up __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but the same thing that i saw in illinoi i wa see in iowa __PUNCT__
thi wa a state that gave me a chanc when nobodi els would __PUNCT__
and no matter what the nation media wa sai __PUNCT__ no matter how far down we were in the poll __PUNCT__ we come here and michel and i __PUNCT__ we feel hope __PUNCT__ becaus we had that same convers that we had had in my first race as a state senat or my first race as u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ go to state fair and stop in town and visit vfw hall and diner and meet peopl whose live __PUNCT__ on the surfac __PUNCT__ might have look differ than mine __PUNCT__ but when you heard their stori __PUNCT__ thei were a common stori __PUNCT__
i thought about my grandpar __PUNCT__ whose servic in world war ii wa reward __PUNCT__ when my grandfath came back from the war and my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ bui their first hous with an fha loan __PUNCT__
i had a singl mom who __PUNCT__ with the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__ wa abl to send my sister and me to great school even though she didn't make a lot of monei __PUNCT__
she wa struggl to put herself through school and work at the same time __PUNCT__
and michel would think about her father __PUNCT__ who had work as a stationari engin at the water filtrat plant __PUNCT__ blue collar job __PUNCT__ all hi life __PUNCT__ and her mom __PUNCT__ who wa a stai __PUNCT__ at __PUNCT__ home mom and then work as a secretari for most of her life __PUNCT__
and we thought about how far we had come and the fact that our live were a testament to that fundament american ideal that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ america a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
america a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
and that same stori __PUNCT__ my famili stori __PUNCT__ michel famili stori __PUNCT__ i heard it from you gui __PUNCT__
it wa your stori __PUNCT__
and we understood __PUNCT__
and we sit and talk __PUNCT__ and we agre that america ha never been a countri of peopl look for handout __PUNCT__
we a nation of worker and dreamer and doer __PUNCT__
and we understand that we got to work for everyth that we got __PUNCT__
and all we ask for is that hard work pai off __PUNCT__ that respons is reward __PUNCT__ so that if you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ if you will to put in some sweat and tear and overcom some difficulti in your life __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that pai the bill and afford a home that you can call your own and count on health care when you get sick and put awai enough to retir on __PUNCT__ mayb take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__
i wa tell folk in ohio the other dai __PUNCT__ i rememb my favorit vacat when i wa __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ travel the countri with my grandmoth and my mom and my sister __PUNCT__
and onc in a while we rent a car __PUNCT__ but a bunch of time we just take greyhound buse __PUNCT__
and sometim we take the train and stai at howard johnson __PUNCT__
and as long as there wa a littl puddl of a pool __PUNCT__ i be happi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you go to the ic machin and the vend machin and bui a soda and get the ic __PUNCT__ and you were realli excit about it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and what wa import wa just the time that you had to spend with your famili __PUNCT__
it wasn't anyth fanci __PUNCT__ but you understood that you could spend time with your famili __PUNCT__
thei were care for __PUNCT__
you had a sens of secur __PUNCT__
you could provid for your children an educ that would allow them to do even better than you did __PUNCT__
that wa the basic bargain that built america middl class __PUNCT__ the largest middl class on earth __PUNCT__
that what built our prosper __PUNCT__ the greatest economi the world ever known __PUNCT__
and so those share memori __PUNCT__ those share stori __PUNCT__ that wa the basi of our campaign when i ran for presid __PUNCT__
that why i talk about the first time i came to cedar rapid __PUNCT__ becaus we came togeth as democrat and independ and republican becaus for too long that basic bargain __PUNCT__ that vision of what it mean to make it in america __PUNCT__ had been slip awai for too mani folk __PUNCT__
peopl were work harder for less __PUNCT__
it wa more difficult to save __PUNCT__ more difficult to retir __PUNCT__
the cost of health care and colleg wa go through the roof __PUNCT__
and we understood that turn that around wa not go to be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it would take more than __NUM__ year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what we didn't know wa that we were about to get hit with the worst econom crisi in our lifetim __PUNCT__
and that crisi ha put us through some realli tough time here in iowa and all across the countri __PUNCT__
it rob million of our fellow american their job and their home and their save __PUNCT__
and it made the american dream seem even further out of reach for too mani hard __PUNCT__ work peopl __PUNCT__
but the basic idea of why i ran in __NUM__ the reason you here todai __PUNCT__ is becaus that crisi did not chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it did not chang our charact __PUNCT__
it did not chang our valu __PUNCT__
we still know what make us great __PUNCT__
we still know that what make us great is the fact that if you work hard in thi countri __PUNCT__ you can still make it __PUNCT__
that vision we still believ in __PUNCT__
the vision of a strong middl class is what we fight for __PUNCT__
our mission right now is not just to recov from a recess __PUNCT__
it to reclaim the basic secur that so mani american have lost __PUNCT__
our goal is to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ but it also to build an economi where that work pai off __PUNCT__ an economi in which everybodi __PUNCT__ whether thei start a busi or thei punch a clock __PUNCT__ can have confid that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__
that what i been fight for for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you know what hold us back from meet thi challeng is not a lack of idea or a lack of solut __PUNCT__
what hold us back from make even more progress than we made is a stalem in washington between two fundament differ view about which path we should take as a countri __PUNCT__
and thi elect is about break that stalem __PUNCT__
thi elect will determin our econom futur for the next gener __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ the choic could not be clearer __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei sincer believ that prosper come from the top down __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei believ that if we spend trillion of dollar more on tax cut __PUNCT__ mostli for the wealthi __PUNCT__ that it will somehow creat more job __PUNCT__ even if we have to pai for it by gut educ __PUNCT__ chop assist to commun colleg and pell grant __PUNCT__ cut back on train __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ rais middl class tax __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei believ that if we roll back regul that we put in place on bank and insur compani and oil compani __PUNCT__ all meant to protect our peopl and our economi __PUNCT__ that somehow everybodi is go to be better off __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and i think thei wrong __PUNCT__
i think thei wrong __PUNCT__
and listen __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ it not just my opinion __PUNCT__
we tri it their wai through most of the last decad __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
we fought two war on a credit card __PUNCT__ still pai for trillion of dollar in tax cut that didn't lead to more job or better wage for the middl class __PUNCT__
and the lack of rule on wall street is what allow peopl to take shortcut and game the system in a wai that caus thi whole mess in the first place __PUNCT__
so we tri what thei sell __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
and somehow thei think you don't rememb __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but you rememb __PUNCT__ and we don't need more top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
what we need is somebodi who go to fight everi singl dai to grow the middl class __PUNCT__ becaus that how our economi grow __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ where everybodi got a shot __PUNCT__
that how the economi grow __PUNCT__
so i wa over at jason and ali __PUNCT__ and wonder __PUNCT__ wonder stori __PUNCT__ realli nice famili __PUNCT__
jason the new princip over at central citi high __PUNCT__
ali an account manag at a document scan compani __PUNCT__
thei got a veri cute __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ cooper __PUNCT__ and then the yet __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ be __PUNCT__ name other cute on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei met at a conveni store where thei work while thei were in school __PUNCT__
appar __PUNCT__ ali wa jason boss __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and she is still hi boss __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that doe not chang __PUNCT__
that how it work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so we were talk about someth that nobodi look forward to __PUNCT__ and that pai tax __PUNCT__
everybodi understand it someth you have to do __PUNCT__ you don't love do it __PUNCT__
but we were talk about how over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ becaus of polici my administr put in place __PUNCT__ we been abl to offer the mclaughlin about __MONEY__ in tax relief __PUNCT__
and thei said that made a real differ in their live __PUNCT__
it help them pai their bill __PUNCT__ help them get daycar for cooper __PUNCT__
we were sit and i wa tell them the hous thei in now is roughli the same size as the hous that michel and i live in for the first __NUM__ year that we were marri __PUNCT__
we had a littl co __PUNCT__ op __PUNCT__
and when thei were talk about the bill __PUNCT__ i rememb go through them __PUNCT__
you got the mortgag __PUNCT__
you got the student loan __PUNCT__
you got the electr bill __PUNCT__ car note __PUNCT__ ga bill __PUNCT__ daycar __PUNCT__
everyth thei were talk about wa familiar becaus michel and i went through it __PUNCT__
and that __MONEY__ help __PUNCT__
it made a differ __PUNCT__
now we got a choic to make __PUNCT__ becaus on __DATE__ tax ar schedul to go up on everybodi in america __PUNCT__
that what the law sai right now __PUNCT__ if we don't do anyth __PUNCT__ if congress doesn't do anyth __PUNCT__ tax will go up on everybodi at the end of thi year __PUNCT__
yesterdai i call on congress to stop ani tax hike for the __NUM__ percent of american who ar just like the mclaughlin __PUNCT__ just like you __PUNCT__
becaus if congress doesn't act __PUNCT__ then that tax hike could cost up to __MONEY__ for a famili of four __PUNCT__
that wouldn't just be a big financi hit for jason and ali __PUNCT__ becaus as thei point out __PUNCT__ and thi is what i love about america and what i love about them __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ as tight as thing mai be for us __PUNCT__ we a lot better off than a lot of folk we know __PUNCT__
so imagin if it tough for them what it go to be for somebodi els __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
like my mom __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
like your mom __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
it would be not onli a huge blow to those famili __PUNCT__ it would be a big blow to our entir economi at a time when we need all the help we can get __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i believ that we should make sure that tax on the __NUM__ percent of american don't go up __PUNCT__ and then we should let the tax cut expir for folk like me __PUNCT__ for the top __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
so anybodi make over __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ includ me __PUNCT__ we go back to the tax rate that we were pai under bill clinton __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ wa a time when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and creat plenti of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the reason i sai that is not becaus i just love to pai tax __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it becaus i know i can afford it __PUNCT__ and to give me anoth tax break or to give warren buffett anoth tax break or to give mitt romnei anoth tax break __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that would cost about a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ and we can't afford it __PUNCT__ not at a time where we try to bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
not at a time when we try to reduc our debt __PUNCT__
so thi ha noth to do with me want to punish success __PUNCT__
we love folk get rich __PUNCT__
i hope malia and sasha go out there and if that what thei want to do __PUNCT__ that great __PUNCT__
but i do want to make sure that everybodi els get that chanc as well __PUNCT__
and for us to give a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of tax break to folk who don't need it __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ folk who don't need it and aren't even ask for it __PUNCT__ that doesn't make sens __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the republican in congress and mr __PUNCT__ romnei disagre with me __PUNCT__
and that what democraci all about __PUNCT__
thei want more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ on top of the exist bush tax cut __PUNCT__ thei want to give __MONEY__ trillion more in tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no wai __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and that fight is a big part of what thi elect about __PUNCT__
we go to have that debat __PUNCT__ here in iowa and all across the countri __PUNCT__
but in the meantim __PUNCT__ doesn't it make sens for us to agre to keep tax low for __NUM__ percent of american who ar work hard and can't afford a tax hike right now __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ think about it __PUNCT__
i want to hold tax steadi for __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ republican sai thei want to do the same thing __PUNCT__
we disagre on the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ what do you usual do if you agre on __NUM__ percent and you disagre on __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
compromis __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
why don't you compromis to help the middl class __PUNCT__ go ahead and do the __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ and we can keep argu about the __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
let agre when we can agre __PUNCT__
let not hold the vast major of american hostag while we debat the merit of anoth tax cut for the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ let stand up for famili like your that ar work hard everi dai __PUNCT__ give you some certainti so you can start plan __PUNCT__ so you have an idea of what come next year __PUNCT__
