i met too mani good american who work so hard __PUNCT__ show so much resili __PUNCT__ so much resolv __PUNCT__ we have been fight our wai back from some of the same polici he advoc __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__ we have tri it __PUNCT__ we can't go back __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i believ that the biggest issu in thi elect is how do we rebuild a strong middl class and provid ladder for opportun all those who want to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ who ar will to work hard __PUNCT__ will to take respons __PUNCT__
ar we go to make sure that we a countri where everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ so the economi is the domin issu __PUNCT__
but i want everybodi to understand that that not the onli place where governor romnei is offer you a sketchi deal __PUNCT__
it bad enough that my oppon want to take us back to the fail econom polici of the past __PUNCT__
but when it come to issu critic to women __PUNCT__ the right to make your own decis about your health __PUNCT__ the right to be treat fairli and equal in the workplac __PUNCT__ governor romnei want to take us to polici more suit to the 1950 __PUNCT__
even hi own run mate said he __PUNCT__ kind of a throwback to the __PUNCT__ 50 __PUNCT__
that on thing we agre on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i __PUNCT__ he mai not have notic __PUNCT__ we in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a woman deserv equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
thi should be a no __PUNCT__ brainer __PUNCT__
but no matter how mani time governor romnei is ask whether or not he support a law uphold that idea __PUNCT__ he refus to sai __PUNCT__
why should thi be hard __PUNCT__ ar you for equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__ ar you for make sure that law enforc that basic principl __PUNCT__ he can't tell you __PUNCT__
i can __PUNCT__
i support that law __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the lilli ledbett fair pai act wa the first law that i sign into offic __PUNCT__
and thi isn't just a women issu __PUNCT__
no man should want hi wife or hi daughter paid less than a man for do the same job __PUNCT__
thi is a famili issu __PUNCT__
thi is an econom issu __PUNCT__
it on that we got to fight for __PUNCT__
when governor romnei sai he go to get rid of fund for plan parenthood __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
what he appar doesn't understand is that there ar million of women all across the countri who reli on plan parenthood not just for contracept care __PUNCT__ but for prevent care __PUNCT__
that not just a health issu __PUNCT__ it an econom issu __PUNCT__
when governor romnei said he have support an extrem measur in massachusett that could have outlaw some form of contracept __PUNCT__ when he join the far right of hi parti to support a bill that would have allow ani employ to deni contracept care to their employe __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ what he didn't get is that make sure your insur polici cover contracept care is an econom issu also __PUNCT__
i don't think your boss should decid what best for your health and safeti __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i don't think your insur compani get to decid what care you should get __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and i sure don't think ani politician should decid __PUNCT__
the onli person who should decid about your health care is you __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that why we fought so hard to pass health care reform __PUNCT__ a.k.a __PUNCT__ obamacar __PUNCT__
that why we push for it __PUNCT__
thi law ha secur new access to prevent care like mammogram and other cancer screen for more than __NUM__ million women __PUNCT__ with no co __PUNCT__ pai __PUNCT__ no deduct __PUNCT__ no out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ pocket cost __PUNCT__ becaus i do not believ a work mother should have to put off a mammogram just becaus monei is tight __PUNCT__
thi law mean that most health plan ar now begin to cover the cost of contracept care __PUNCT__ becaus i don't think a colleg student in charlottesvil or blacksburg or fairfax should have to choos between textbook or the prevent care that she need __PUNCT__
and by the wai for all the young peopl out here __PUNCT__ obamacar ha alreadi allow nearli __NUM__ million young adult under the ag of __NUM__ to sign up to stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__
for all those who ar young at heart __PUNCT__ but not young in year __PUNCT__ it alreadi save million of senior on medicar hundr of dollar on their prescript medicin __PUNCT__
insur compani can no longer put lifetim limit on your care or discrimin against children with preexist condit __PUNCT__
and soon __PUNCT__ thei no longer be abl to charg women more for the same care just becaus thei women __PUNCT__
that what chang look like __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i know he call him sever __PUNCT__ he call himself __PUNCT__ sever conserv __PUNCT__ but there noth conserv about a govern that prevent a woman from make her own health care decis __PUNCT__
he talk about freedom __PUNCT__ but freedom is the abil to choos the care you need when you need it __PUNCT__
freedom is the abil to chang job or start your own busi without the fear of lose your health insur __PUNCT__
freedom is the knowledg that you no longer be charg more than men for the same health care or deni afford coverag just becaus you beat cancer __PUNCT__
when the next presid and congress could tip the balanc of the highest court in the land in a wai that turn back the clock for women and famili for decad to come __PUNCT__ you don't want someon who need to ask for binder of women __PUNCT__
you don't want that gui __PUNCT__
you want a presid who ha alreadi appoint two unbeliev women to the suprem court of the unit state __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ the choic __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
obama __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
