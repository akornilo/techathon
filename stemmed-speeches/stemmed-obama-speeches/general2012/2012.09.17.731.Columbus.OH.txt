and thi is not just a choic between two candid or two parti __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two differ vision for how we move the countri forward __PUNCT__
what we fight for __PUNCT__ our vision is to restor the basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__ that built the largest middl class and the strongest economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and that bargain can be state veri simpli __PUNCT__

thei want tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ we roll back some regul and then give you more tax cut __PUNCT__

i don't think give me a tax break or give mr __PUNCT__ romnei a tax break will help pai down our deficit __PUNCT__
i don't believ that fire teacher or kick student off of financi aid is somehow go to grow our economi __PUNCT__
that not go to help us compet against all the scientist and engin come out of china __PUNCT__
and after all we been through __PUNCT__ doe anybodi realli think that somehow roll back regul on wall street __PUNCT__ that we put in place to make sure we don't have anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout __PUNCT__ that somehow that go to be good for the small businesswoman here in columbu or help the construct worker get back on the job __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ we have tri what thei sell __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ we don't believ that the answer to our challeng is just to tell folk you on your own __PUNCT__
we think we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
you look at thi crowd __PUNCT__ peopl of everi walk of life __PUNCT__ that what america is __PUNCT__
and we don't believ thi economi grow from the top down __PUNCT__ we think it grow from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__ when i cut tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__ why did i do that __PUNCT__ becaus when you gui have a littl more monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you spend it becaus you need to __PUNCT__ becaus you got expens __PUNCT__
so then you decid __PUNCT__ you bui a new comput for your kid go off to colleg or you final trade in that old __PUNCT__ beat __PUNCT__ up car you got __PUNCT__ and so busi then __PUNCT__ thei have more profit __PUNCT__
thei got more custom __PUNCT__
that mean thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
that mean those folk then have more monei to spend __PUNCT__
the whole economi doe better __PUNCT__
if you give a tax break to a billionair __PUNCT__ you can onli bui so mani yacht __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ at a certain point __PUNCT__ you stop __PUNCT__
so it doesn't do the same thing for the economi __PUNCT__
so not onli is it the right thing to do __PUNCT__ it the smart thing to do for us to grow __PUNCT__ to make sure that middl class famili ar strong and peopl who ar poor and will to work hard to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ that thei got a chanc __PUNCT__
that our vision __PUNCT__
that why we not go backward __PUNCT__
that why we go forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
hold on a second __PUNCT__ i want you to know __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ becaus some of you mai not have been pai attent at the convent becaus you were still think about michel and how good she wa __PUNCT__
or mayb you were still talk about presid clinton and how he broke it down __PUNCT__
but i want everybodi to be clear __PUNCT__ the path i offer isn't quick or easi __PUNCT__
it go to take more than a few year to deal with all the challeng that we face __PUNCT__
but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ when i hear the other side talk about how the nation is in declin __PUNCT__ i tell them __PUNCT__ you must not be get out much __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ becaus thi is america and we still got the best worker in the world and the best entrepreneur in the world and the best scientist and research in the world and the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
and there is not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with us right now __PUNCT__
so i confid our problem can be solv __PUNCT__ our challeng will be met __PUNCT__
the path i offer is harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place becaus it allow everybodi to prosper __PUNCT__
anybodi who is will to work hard can get ahead __PUNCT__
i ask you to choos that futur __PUNCT__
and i ask you to ralli around a specif set of goal __PUNCT__ to creat new manufactur job and to strengthen our energi sector and improv educ and bring down our deficit and turn the page on a decad of war __PUNCT__
that what i intend to accomplish in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i need those __NUM__ year to get all that done __PUNCT__
so let me just break down thi plan veri clearli __PUNCT__
part on __PUNCT__ we go to export more product __PUNCT__ and we go to outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
after a decad where manufactur had been declin __PUNCT__ thi countri ha now creat over the last 2Â½ year over half a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__ a whole lot of them right here in ohio __PUNCT__
when there were some who said __PUNCT__ just let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ when there were folk who were will to walk awai from all the job that ar support here in ohio by the auto industri __PUNCT__ i bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha brought back nearli __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
it come roar back __PUNCT__
so you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can do what mr __PUNCT__ romnei suggest and keep give tax break __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
we can keep give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that ar open new plant and train new worker and creat new job right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and when it come to trade __PUNCT__ i understand my oppon ha been run around ohio claim he go to take the fight to china __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ thi is a gui whose experi ha been own compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc job to countri like china __PUNCT__ made monei invest in compani ship job to china __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ you can't stand up to china if all you done is send them our job __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you can talk a good game __NUM__ week befor an elect __PUNCT__ but you can't just talk the talk __PUNCT__ you got to walk the walk __PUNCT__
i wake up everi singl dai think about america worker and make sure thei got a fair shot in thi economi __PUNCT__
when other countri don't plai by the rule __PUNCT__ we walk the walk __PUNCT__
we brought more trade case against china in on term than the previou administr did in two __PUNCT__
when governor romnei wa complain that becaus we stop an unfair surg in chines tire here into the unit state __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ well no __PUNCT__ that protectionist __PUNCT__
we did it anywai __PUNCT__
and we got over __NUM__ american job back __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state __PUNCT__
earlier thi year __PUNCT__ i set up a new task forc to go after everi unfair trade practic that harm our worker __PUNCT__ and it alreadi deliv __PUNCT__
two month ago __PUNCT__ we move to hold china account for unfair trade practic that harm american automak __PUNCT__
todai my administr is launch a new action against china __PUNCT__ thi on against illeg subsidi that encourag compani to ship auto part manufactur job oversea __PUNCT__ which directli hurt men and women on the assembl line in ohio and michigan and throughout the midwest __PUNCT__
your senat __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ sherrod brown __PUNCT__ ha fought as hard as anybodi on thi __PUNCT__
so where folk ar break the rule __PUNCT__ we go after them __PUNCT__
we not go to let it stand __PUNCT__
it not right __PUNCT__
it against the rule __PUNCT__
we not go to let it stand __PUNCT__
american worker build better product than anybodi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ mean someth __PUNCT__
and when the plai field is level __PUNCT__ we alwai win __PUNCT__
so that a choic you got in thi elect __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ becaus my oppon __PUNCT__ not onli doe he want to keep tax incent that would send job oversea __PUNCT__ he want to expand them __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
i love you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__ but i not finish __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you choos the path i offer __PUNCT__ then we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
we can sell more good around the world made right here __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we shown we can do it __PUNCT__
but that not all it go to take to rebuild our economi __PUNCT__
we got to make sure our worker ar train to fill those good job __PUNCT__
and that why the second part of my plan is to give everi american the chanc to earn the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa the gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__
it wa what gave michel a chanc __PUNCT__
it what gave so mani of you a chanc __PUNCT__
it the path to a middl class life __PUNCT__
and when i sai __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ a higher educ __PUNCT__ it doesn't mean __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
it mai be you go to a commun colleg for __NUM__ or a train program __PUNCT__
but the point is __PUNCT__ it not enough right now just to get that __NUM__ year in high school becaus the economi is more complic now and the skill that ar need ar more advanc __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the good new is we alreadi done work on thi __PUNCT__
so million of student ar alreadi pai less for colleg becaus of what we did __PUNCT__
we took on a system that wa wast billion of taxpay dollar us bank and lender as middlemen for the student loan program __PUNCT__ and we said why do we need the middlemen __PUNCT__ let cut them out __PUNCT__
let give the monei directli to student __PUNCT__
and as a consequ __PUNCT__ we been abl to help young peopl all across thi countri __PUNCT__
but onc again __PUNCT__ we got a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ becaus governor romnei want to roll back what we did __PUNCT__
then he got a budget that would gut educ to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
that on path __PUNCT__ but i offer a differ path __PUNCT__
i believ that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should ever have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom or outdat textbook __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find worker with the right skill here at home __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ what i offer __PUNCT__ and i need your help __PUNCT__
i need you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher and improv earli childhood educ and give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn the skill thei need at commun colleg and help us work with colleg and univers to keep tuition down so that our young peopl have a chanc at a futur without take on ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ worth of debt __PUNCT__
we can meet that goal __PUNCT__ but i need your help __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
third thing __PUNCT__ we got to control our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ detroit is make those car __PUNCT__ and toledo is make those car __PUNCT__
all across the midwest __PUNCT__ we see american car now __PUNCT__
we go to meet those standard __PUNCT__
we go to beat those standard __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi we gener from sourc like wind and solar __PUNCT__
that creat thousand of job build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri right here in ohio __PUNCT__
america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
so we alreadi made progress __PUNCT__ but we can make more __PUNCT__
and the question is __PUNCT__ ar we go to go back to a plan that revers the progress __PUNCT__ or do we build on our progress __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ i want you gui to know __PUNCT__ i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
i not go to let them keep collect __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
the path we offer is to keep invest in wind and solar __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ and make sure farmer and scientist ar har new biofuel to power our car and our truck __PUNCT__
let put construct worker back to work rehab and retrofit build and factori so thei wast less energi __PUNCT__
let develop a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that beneath our feet __PUNCT__
and if we do all thi __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and support __NUM__ new job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
that the path forward __PUNCT__
fourth thing __PUNCT__ let reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ we realli do have to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
but the wai i do it __PUNCT__ we cut our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ make sure everybodi doe it the right wai __PUNCT__
i work with republican in congress __PUNCT__ we cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth in spend __PUNCT__
not everi program work __PUNCT__
there is some wast in govern __PUNCT__ we can take and make sure that we bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
i want to reform our tax code so that it simpl and it fair __PUNCT__ but i also want to make sure we ask the wealthiest household to pai a slightli higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ the same rate that we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ when our economi wa creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ when we had the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and we had a whole bunch of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and why is it that we creat a lot millionair __PUNCT__ becaus when middl class famili ar do well __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
when you give ladder of opportun for poor folk to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
thei got more monei to spend __PUNCT__ thei bui product __PUNCT__ we hire more worker __PUNCT__
everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to sai __PUNCT__ my oppon doe have hi own plan __PUNCT__ but it miss on thing __PUNCT__ arithmet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it doesn't add up __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ think about it __PUNCT__
he sai that the most import thing we have is to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
and i realli want __PUNCT__ i hope some republican ar watch right now and some independ __PUNCT__ becaus i just want everybodi to break down the math __PUNCT__
you sai you want to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
so what your first plan __PUNCT__ you go to spend __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
sometim peopl lose sight of how much thi mean __PUNCT__
so __MONEY__ trillion over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ that __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ i think my math is right __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ that how much we spend on the defens depart __PUNCT__ our entir militari __PUNCT__
so he go to give a tax cut __PUNCT__ mostli go to wealthi folk like me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ a __MONEY__ tax break for peopl make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__ and it go to cost us __MONEY__ trillion on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thei must have skip math class when thei were __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ everi time thei ask to explain thi plan __PUNCT__ thei won't explain it becaus thei can't __PUNCT__
thei cannot explain how thei pai for a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut without slash educ fund __PUNCT__ slash invest in research __PUNCT__ slash invest in help our senior and peopl who ar vulner __PUNCT__ and in rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
but it doesn't stop there __PUNCT__
thei then want to add anoth __MONEY__ trillion in militari spend __PUNCT__ and thei sai thei won't add to the deficit __PUNCT__ but keep in mind __PUNCT__ thi is stuff the joint chief of staff sai is not requir to keep us safe __PUNCT__
so that __MONEY__ trillion altogeth __PUNCT__ on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
trillion of dollar __PUNCT__ and thei go to ask you to pai for it to give me a tax break __PUNCT__
i tell you __PUNCT__ you cannot make it work __PUNCT__
you can't cross the __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ s and dot the __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ s on thi plan __PUNCT__
and columbu is a town where you got to dot the __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__
you can't get awai with that __PUNCT__
so when independ folk have tri to explain it __PUNCT__ thei gone through it __PUNCT__ and thei kind of gotten their calcul out __PUNCT__ thei talli these up __PUNCT__
and on independ report show that governor romnei tax plan would provid an addit __MONEY__ tax cut for multimillionair __PUNCT__ but to pai for it __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of taxpay would actual foot the bill __PUNCT__
you pai more __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ imagin a sellout crowd for a buckey footbal game at the __PUNCT__ horsesho __PUNCT__
under my oppon tax plan __PUNCT__ __NUM__ fan at the game would get an averag tax cut of __MONEY__ and about __NUM__ fan would have to pai for it __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the on who would get the tax break ar the gui in the box seat __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i am not go to ask middl class famili with kid to pai over __MONEY__ more so that millionair and billionair get to pai less __PUNCT__
i not go to ask __NUM__ ohio student to pai more for colleg or kick children off of head start or elimin health insur for the poor or the elderli or the disabl to pai for a tax cut for folk who don't need it __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i not go to turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
if you work hard all your life __PUNCT__ you should not spend your golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
you should retir with the digniti that you have earn __PUNCT__
so we reform medicar __PUNCT__ but we do it the right wai __PUNCT__ reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by ask senior to foot the bill __PUNCT__
same thing with social secur __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we take respons step to strengthen social secur __PUNCT__ but we not go to turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on last thing __PUNCT__ rebuild our economi is essenti __PUNCT__ but obvious __PUNCT__ our prosper at home is link to our polici abroad __PUNCT__
current event remind us of that __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ we ar heartbroken see what happen last week __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
and as a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ and bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
but for all the challeng __PUNCT__ the event of the past week underscor we still got threat in the world __PUNCT__ so we got to remain vigil __PUNCT__
we go to do everyth we need to do to make sure our diplomat ar safe __PUNCT__
we go to keep provid our troop with the equip and the strategi that thei need __PUNCT__
but what we also go to do is make sure that as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we got the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we go to serv them as well as thei serv us becaus nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon __PUNCT__ he got a differ point of view __PUNCT__
he said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
and he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
he want to spend more monei on program that our joint chief don't even want __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ i want to spend that monei we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put peopl back to work here in ohio __PUNCT__ rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__
after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is the choic that we now face __PUNCT__
thi is what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ thei told us __PUNCT__ over and over again __PUNCT__ how bigger tax cut and fewer regul __PUNCT__ that the onli wai to go __PUNCT__ their wai is the onli wai __PUNCT__
thei sai that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if some compani releas pollut that your kid ar breath __PUNCT__ thei sai it just the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
we insist on person respons __PUNCT__ and we insist on individu initi __PUNCT__
we can't help somebodi who doesn't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
nobodi here is entitl to success __PUNCT__
everybodi ha got to earn it __PUNCT__
we honor folk who start a busi and the striver and the dreamer __PUNCT__ the risk taker who help make our free enterpris system work __PUNCT__
and we believ the free enterpris system is the greatest engin of prosper the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but we also believ that in thi countri __PUNCT__ as citizen __PUNCT__ we accept certain oblig to on anoth and to futur gener __PUNCT__
as citizen __PUNCT__ we understand it not about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ but what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
and that what thi elect wa about __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
it wasn't about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you __PUNCT__
you the reason there a cancer survivor in medina that can afford a health care plan that cover preexist condit __PUNCT__
you the reason there a factori worker in toledo who lost hi job __PUNCT__ but now is back on the line build some of the world best car __PUNCT__
you the reason a young man right here in columbu __PUNCT__ whose mother work three job to rais him __PUNCT__ can now afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ got to the ohio state univers __PUNCT__
that becaus of you __PUNCT__
you the reason some young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag is not suddenli go to be snatch up and deport to a countri that thei don't even know __PUNCT__
you the reason why some outstand soldier won't be kick out of the militari just becaus of who thei love __PUNCT__
you the reason why thousand of famili across the countri ar see folk who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ give them a hug and be abl to sai to them __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
