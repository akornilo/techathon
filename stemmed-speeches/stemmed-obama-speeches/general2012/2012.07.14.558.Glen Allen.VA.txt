audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__
we term limit as presid __PUNCT__
and it got me think about my first polit campaign __PUNCT__
i think about the place i us to travel as a state senat __PUNCT__ when i wa run for the unit state senat __PUNCT__ all across illinoi __PUNCT__ which is a lot like virginia __PUNCT__
you got big citi __PUNCT__ but you also have small town __PUNCT__
you got rural __PUNCT__ suburban __PUNCT__ urban area __PUNCT__
you stop in vfw hall or diner __PUNCT__ or you go to church or synagogu __PUNCT__ and you meet folk __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__
and wherev i went __PUNCT__ even if on the surfac folk look differ __PUNCT__ there wa a common thread that ran through their stori __PUNCT__
and in those stori i saw my own __PUNCT__
so i meet an elderli veteran __PUNCT__ and i think about my grandfath __PUNCT__ who fought in world war ii __PUNCT__ and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who work on a bomber assembl line while he wa awai __PUNCT__ even though thei alreadi had my mother __PUNCT__
and i think about how when my grandfath came back from europ __PUNCT__ he wa abl to get a colleg educ on the gi bill and how thei bui their first home with the help of an fha loan __PUNCT__
and then i meet a singl mom somewher who wa work hard __PUNCT__ rais kid __PUNCT__ and i think about my mom __PUNCT__ becaus my dad left when i wa young __PUNCT__
and so my mother had to work and go to school at the same time and yet __PUNCT__ despit not have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ wa still abl to provid me and my sister with the best educ possibl and instil in us a sens that if we work hard __PUNCT__ we could go as far as our dream would take us __PUNCT__
and then i think about michel parent whenev i meet a work famili __PUNCT__ becaus michel dad wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__
he had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__
by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ realli couldn't walk without two cane __PUNCT__
and he have to wake up an hour earli __PUNCT__ earlier than everybodi els __PUNCT__ just to get dress __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai on the job __PUNCT__
and michel mom __PUNCT__ she stai at home when the kid were young and then found a job as a secretari __PUNCT__
and that the work thei did all their live __PUNCT__
thei had a littl second floor apart that michel and craig live in __PUNCT__ and yet __PUNCT__ despit those modest begin __PUNCT__ michel and her brother were abl to get the best possibl educ __PUNCT__
and so in these travel that i had in that first campaign __PUNCT__ what i wa remind of wa that core idea that is central to thi countri __PUNCT__ what make us except __PUNCT__ what make us great __PUNCT__
it not just how mani skyscrap we have __PUNCT__ it not how power our militari is __PUNCT__
what make us special is thi idea that in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you ar will to work hard __PUNCT__ if you will to take respons for your own life __PUNCT__ then you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ no matter how modest your begin __PUNCT__ you can make it in thi countri if you work hard __PUNCT__
becaus america ha never been a countri of handout __PUNCT__
we a nation of worker and doer and dreamer and risk taker __PUNCT__
we work for what we get __PUNCT__
and all we ask for as american is that our hard work pai off __PUNCT__
all we ask is that our respons is reward __PUNCT__ so that if we put in enough effort __PUNCT__ we can find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ we can afford a home to call our own __PUNCT__ we won't go bankrupt when we get sick __PUNCT__ mayb we can take a vacat onc in a while with our famili __PUNCT__ noth fanci __PUNCT__
i wa tell folk the other dai __PUNCT__ when i think about my favorit vacat when i wa a kid __PUNCT__ when i wa __NUM__ year old my mom __PUNCT__ sister __PUNCT__ and my grandmom __PUNCT__ we travel across the countri __PUNCT__
but we didn't fly on jet __PUNCT__ we took greyhound buse __PUNCT__
took the train sometim __PUNCT__
i think we were in the car twice __PUNCT__
stai at howard johnson __PUNCT__
and the excit thing for me wa if there wa ani kind of swim pool __PUNCT__ it didn't matter how big it wa __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and then after you spend the whole dai swim __PUNCT__ then you go to the vend machin __PUNCT__ get a soda and a bucket of ic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but the point wa to spend time with folk you love and enjoi their compani __PUNCT__
so that wa part of it __PUNCT__ and then peopl expect __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ that thei can retir with digniti and respect after a lifetim of work __PUNCT__
that the essenc of america __PUNCT__ that that is within everybodi grasp __PUNCT__
doesn't mean you not go to have some up and down __PUNCT__
doesn't mean at some point you not go to experi tough time __PUNCT__
but it doe mean that the trajectori of peopl live in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
and that what made us special __PUNCT__
that what made us the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
that what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when i ran in __NUM__ a lot of peopl __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ but republican and independ __PUNCT__ becaus we not democrat or republican first __PUNCT__ we american first __PUNCT__
and we came togeth becaus we felt like that idea had been slip awai for too long __PUNCT__
for almost a decad __PUNCT__ peopl had been work harder __PUNCT__ but get less __PUNCT__
and then the worst financi crisi in our lifetim hit __PUNCT__ the worst econom crisi in our lifetim hit __PUNCT__ million of peopl lost their job or lost their home or lost their save __PUNCT__ and that made the dream that much harder to reach for __PUNCT__
but what i learn over these last 3½ year is that even though the crisi put us through some veri tough time __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar tougher __PUNCT__
folk mai have gotten knock down some __PUNCT__ but thei got back up __PUNCT__
the crisi didn't chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it did not chang our fundament charact as a peopl __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang our sens of purpos from __NUM__ __PUNCT__
our mission right now __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ is to put peopl back to work and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ to strengthen the hous market __PUNCT__ but our purpos is also to rebuild our economi so that it last __PUNCT__ so that work pai off __PUNCT__
an economi in which everybodi __PUNCT__ whether you ar start a busi or punch a clock __PUNCT__ you can have confid that if you work hard you can get ahead __PUNCT__
that our goal __PUNCT__
that our central purpos __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign about __PUNCT__
that what i been work on for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

we love you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ becaus we gone through tough time __PUNCT__ i think there a tendenc sometim for some of the comment to sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi time it realli differ __PUNCT__ we lose our number __PUNCT__ on statu __PUNCT__ and all thi stuff __PUNCT__
i don't bui ani of that __PUNCT__
we still by far the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
and what hold us back from meet our challeng __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
congress __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what hold us back from meet our challeng is not a lack of big idea __PUNCT__ it not technic solut __PUNCT__
you name it __PUNCT__ whatev it is __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ hous __PUNCT__ the deficit __PUNCT__ we have the solut in front of us __PUNCT__
what hold us back is we got a stalem in washington that ha more to do with __PUNCT__ than just two candid for presid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
it two fundament differ vision about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
thi elect is about break that stalem __PUNCT__
the outcom of thi elect will determin not just what happen next year or the year after that __PUNCT__ but what happen for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ my oppon and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ in a top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
thei believ that if we spend trillion of dollar on tax cut __PUNCT__ mostli for the wealthi __PUNCT__ even if we have to pai for it by gut educ or gut job train program or gut invest in basic research or turn medicar into a voucher system or increas middl class tax __PUNCT__ that if we do that __PUNCT__ somehow all of you ar go to benefit __PUNCT__
that their idea __PUNCT__
thei also believ that if we roll back regul on bank and insur compani and credit card compani __PUNCT__ regul that ar meant to protect peopl and our economi __PUNCT__ that somehow everybodi is go to be more secur __PUNCT__
that their basic argument __PUNCT__
thei spend a lot of time talk __PUNCT__ but if you cut through all the stuff __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ what thei realli sai is tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__ roll back regul __PUNCT__
that essenti their plan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it is a plan __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ it a theori __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but here the problem __PUNCT__ we tri it __PUNCT__
we tri it for a decad befor i took offic __PUNCT__
it did not work __PUNCT__
we tri it __PUNCT__ and we turn a surplu into a deficit __PUNCT__
we tri it __PUNCT__ and we had the most sluggish job growth in decad __PUNCT__
we tri it __PUNCT__ and your incom and wage on averag went down __PUNCT__ went down __PUNCT__ even while the cost of health care and educ and ga were all go up __PUNCT__
and then it culmin in the worst financi crisi that we still clean up after __PUNCT__
so it not as if we haven't tri their theori __PUNCT__
it would be on thing if we hadn't tri it __PUNCT__
then thei could sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let try thi __PUNCT__
and mayb everybodi would sai __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that worth try __PUNCT__
but we did thi __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it too late __PUNCT__ those hairdo ar all gone __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
let me talk about on last thing __PUNCT__ and that is the deficit and the debt __PUNCT__
becaus the other side __PUNCT__ thei sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ thi is the most import issu __PUNCT__
and what i said is __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ along with put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ we do need to bring down our deficit and our debt __PUNCT__
after a decad of irrespons __PUNCT__ where i inherit a trillion __PUNCT__ dollar deficit __PUNCT__ i readi to roll up my sleev and get to work __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend that we don't need __PUNCT__
i will to do more __PUNCT__ becaus not everi program work __PUNCT__
govern can't solv everi problem __PUNCT__
govern can't help somebodi if thei don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter how much monei we put into school if __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ you not tell your kid thei need to work hard in school __PUNCT__
but what i not will to do is what my oppon propos __PUNCT__ which is pretend like you lower the deficit and then cut tax for folk like me by __MONEY__ trillion on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ becaus we can't afford it __PUNCT__
what i said to congress is let make sure that everybodi who make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ that your tax don't go up __PUNCT__
that __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
but let ask folk like me who can afford it __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ to do a littl bit more so that we can still help young peopl go to colleg __PUNCT__ so that we don't turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__ so that we still invest in basic research __PUNCT__ so that we can still build road and help folk with the hous situat __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we tri that too __PUNCT__
a gui name bill clinton tri it __PUNCT__ and we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
and we had surplus instead of deficit __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ rich peopl did just fine back then __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ here the thing i think the other side doesn't understand __PUNCT__
when work peopl do well __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that mean busi have more custom __PUNCT__
that is how we grow an economi __PUNCT__ not by everybodi just look out for themselv __PUNCT__ but by all of us come togeth and work hard __PUNCT__
whether __PUNCT__ all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it bring manufactur back __PUNCT__ put construct worker back to work __PUNCT__ protect health care __PUNCT__ make sure our kid get the best educ __PUNCT__ care for our veteran __PUNCT__ all these thing that make up a middl class life __PUNCT__ thei all tie togeth __PUNCT__
thei all central to that idea that if you work hard you can get ahead __PUNCT__
that the promis that our parent and our grandpar and our great __PUNCT__ grandpar made to futur gener __PUNCT__
some of them came here as immigr __PUNCT__ some came here not want to come __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ when thei got here __PUNCT__ all of us __PUNCT__ whether thei were work on farm or whether thei were work in mine or work in __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ in a factori __PUNCT__ that idea that if i work hard now __PUNCT__ thing will be better for my kid __PUNCT__ that what built thi countri __PUNCT__
and over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side go to spend more monei than we ever seen in our lifetim on a bunch of neg ad __PUNCT__
and thei go to try to peddl thi econom theori that everybodi know we tri and didn't work __PUNCT__
and sinc thei know that probabl is not go to sell __PUNCT__ realli what these ad ar go to do is just sai __PUNCT__ the economi isn't where it need to be __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
that their messag __PUNCT__
thei us all those scari voic in the ad and __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but that basic their messag __PUNCT__
and that a plan for mayb win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan for creat job or help the middl class __PUNCT__
it not a plan for rebuild our economi __PUNCT__
and so i don't worri about the kind of monei thei spend becaus what you taught me in __NUM__ same thing i learn in my first campaign __PUNCT__ wa that when ordinari folk come togeth __PUNCT__ when thei cut through all the nonsens and thei rememb what make thi countri great __PUNCT__ thei tap into those core american valu and thei rememb what true about our live __PUNCT__ when you come togeth __PUNCT__ noth can stop you __PUNCT__
when you come togeth __PUNCT__ chang happen __PUNCT__
when you come togeth __PUNCT__ peopl get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ when you decid __PUNCT__
and that the choic you have now in thi elect __PUNCT__
so i have to tell you __PUNCT__ when i ran in __NUM__ i tri to make sure that ani promis i made __PUNCT__ i could keep __PUNCT__
so i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we end the war __PUNCT__
i said i keep your tax down __PUNCT__ and i lower tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ on averag __PUNCT__
if somebodi tell you i rais their tax __PUNCT__ tell them that ain't right __PUNCT__
