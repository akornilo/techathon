__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ for a lot of young peopl it a lot higher __PUNCT__ and that kind of debt mean pretti tough choic when you first start out __PUNCT__
it might mean put off start a famili or bui a home or put off chase that great idea that you got for a small busi __PUNCT__
when a big chunk of each paycheck goe toward pai off your loan debt __PUNCT__ that not just tough for middl class famili that ar try to make it and young peopl who ar try to get start __PUNCT__ it also pain for the entir economi becaus that mean that monei you might be spend on bui a new home or do someth els with it __PUNCT__ it go to that check that you write everi singl month __PUNCT__
it not go to the local busi __PUNCT__
and i have to sai __PUNCT__ thi is someth michel and i know firsthand about __PUNCT__
i not specul on thi __PUNCT__ becaus we been in your shoe __PUNCT__
neither of us came from wealthi famili __PUNCT__
both of us graduat from colleg and law school with a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
when we marri __PUNCT__ we got poorer togeth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we combin our liabil into on big liabil __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we paid more for our student loan than we paid on our mortgag each month __PUNCT__ and that went on for year __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ onc we had malia and sasha __PUNCT__ we need to start save for their colleg educ but we were still pai off our colleg educ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind we were lucki enough to land good job __PUNCT__ we had steadi incom __PUNCT__ but we did not finish pai off our student loan until about __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
i not __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you got an educ __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
i got an educ __PUNCT__ and it work out pretti good __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but the point i make is __PUNCT__ i onli stand befor you becaus of the chanc that my educ gave me __PUNCT__
so i can tell you with some experi that make higher educ more afford for our young peopl __PUNCT__ it someth i got a person stake in __PUNCT__
it someth that michel ha a person stake in __PUNCT__
we believ in it becaus we been there and we know that unless you provid those rung on the ladder of opportun __PUNCT__ young peopl who ar more talent than we ar mai not get a shot __PUNCT__
that why i made it a top prioriti of my presid __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ that is someth that is at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
that part of the reason why __DATE__ is so import __PUNCT__
and i sai thi becaus put a colleg educ within reach for work famili just doesn't seem to be a big prioriti for my oppon __PUNCT__
a few month ago __PUNCT__ just up the road __PUNCT__ in westervil __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ if you want to be success __PUNCT__ if you want to go to colleg or start a busi __PUNCT__ you can just __PUNCT__ and i quot here __PUNCT__ borrow monei if you have to from your parent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and when a high school student in youngstown ask him what he would do to make colleg more afford for famili like hi __PUNCT__ governor romnei didn't sai anyth about grant or loan program that ar critic to million of student to get a colleg educ __PUNCT__
he said noth about work __PUNCT__ studi program or rise colleg tuition __PUNCT__
he didn't sai a word about commun colleg or how import higher educ is to america futur __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ the best thing you can do is shop around __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the best thing i can do for you is to tell you to shop around __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
that it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that it __PUNCT__
that hi plan __PUNCT__
that hi answer to young peopl who ar try to figur out how to go to colleg and make sure that thei don't have a mountain of debt __PUNCT__ shop around and borrow more monei from your parent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
what ar we go to do __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i just got to __PUNCT__ i want to make sure everybodi understand __PUNCT__
not everybodi ha parent who have the monei to lend __PUNCT__
that mai be new to some folk __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it the truth __PUNCT__
so what governor romnei is offer is not an answer __PUNCT__
there noth a parent want more than to give opportun to their kid that thei never had __PUNCT__
and it pretti pain for a lot of parent if thei can't do that __PUNCT__
but as we fight back from the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ you got a lot of parent who ar out there struggl just to make end meet __PUNCT__
and i don't accept the notion that we should deni ani child the opportun to get a higher educ __PUNCT__
if thei been work hard __PUNCT__ if thei got the grade __PUNCT__ if thei got the determin to get a better futur for themselv __PUNCT__ i don't want them to be prevent just becaus their famili were hit hard by a recess __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what america is about __PUNCT__
we give everybodi a fair shot __PUNCT__
think about all the discoveri __PUNCT__ all the busi __PUNCT__ all the breakthrough that we would not have made if we told everi young person who ha got the drive and the will and the grade to go to colleg __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ too bad __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
we alwai made a commit to put a good educ within the reach of everybodi who is will to work for it __PUNCT__
that part of what make us special __PUNCT__
that what keep us at the front __PUNCT__ forefront of busi and scienc and technolog and medicin __PUNCT__
and thi date back for decad __PUNCT__
some of you know my grandfath fought in world war ii __PUNCT__
when he came back __PUNCT__ he had a chanc to go to colleg becaus thi countri decid everi return veteran of world war ii should be abl to afford it __PUNCT__
my mother wa abl to rais me and my sister becaus she wa abl to get grant and work her wai through school __PUNCT__
michel and i would not be here todai without the help of scholarship and student loan __PUNCT__
and i know steve wouldn't be here either __PUNCT__ and neither would a lot of you __PUNCT__
so in a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__ a colleg educ should be avail for everybodi __PUNCT__ not just the wealthi few __PUNCT__
whether it a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year colleg __PUNCT__ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year program __PUNCT__ higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess that everi famili in america should be abl to afford __PUNCT__
and that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
it on of the reason i run for presid of the unit state for a second term __PUNCT__
and i want __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and i want you to know that i have not just talk the talk __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you have walk the walk __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we have walk the walk __PUNCT__
sinc i took offic __PUNCT__ we have help more than __NUM__ million addit student afford a colleg educ with grant that go farther than thei did befor __PUNCT__
the econom plan my oppon ha would cut our invest in educ by nearli __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it would cut those grant so deepli that __NUM__ million of those student who we have help would no longer get a scholarship at all __PUNCT__
it would cut financi aid for nearli __NUM__ million student a year __PUNCT__
and keep in mind thei not make these cut to creat job __PUNCT__
thei not propos these cut to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__
governor romnei is propos these cut to pai for a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that weight toward the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
doe that sound like a better plan for america __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
doe that sound like a better plan for you __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
a plan that sai that we can't afford to help the next gener earn an educ __PUNCT__ but we can afford massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__ a plan that sai we can't afford our young peopl __PUNCT__ to offer our young peopl student loan becaus we got to protect corpor tax loophol __PUNCT__ it a vision that sai we can't help young peopl who ar try to make it becaus we got to protect the folk who alreadi have made it __PUNCT__
michel and i ar go to be abl to send malia and sasha to colleg __PUNCT__
we don't need an extra tax break __PUNCT__
you do __PUNCT__
their vision is wrong for move america forward __PUNCT__
it not a vision you got to accept __PUNCT__
that why __DATE__ is import __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
governor romnei make hi time as an investor in the privat sector the basi of hi candidaci __PUNCT__
that how he sai he go to fix the economi __PUNCT__ i wa in the privat sector __PUNCT__
and hi econom plan make on thing clear __PUNCT__ he doe not think invest in your futur is worth it __PUNCT__
he doesn't think that a good invest __PUNCT__
i do __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
that the choic in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that why we fought to make sure the interest rate on feder student loan didn't go up over the summer __PUNCT__
we won that fight __PUNCT__
some of these republican member of congress would have allow those rate to doubl __PUNCT__ cost more than __NUM__ million student an extra thousand dollar a year __PUNCT__
i said i want to extend the colleg tax credit that my administr creat so more famili can save up to __MONEY__ on their tuition over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
thei want to end that tax credit __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis we would reform a student loan system that wa give ten of billion of taxpay dollar to big bank and lobbyist instead of student __PUNCT__
there ar plenti of folk in washington who fought tooth and nail to keep that system as it wa __PUNCT__
we kept at it __PUNCT__ we won that fight __PUNCT__ we us it to doubl grant aid for student __PUNCT__
my oppon now want to go back to the wai thing were __PUNCT__
he want to go backward to the polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ part of our job is also to make sure you don't need a ph.d __PUNCT__ to appli for financi aid in the first place __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so we put in place thi new consum protect watchdog __PUNCT__ the consum financ protect bureau __PUNCT__ put in place __PUNCT__ and it work with the depart of educ to develop a simpl new fact sheet on student loan and financi aid so you can have all the inform you need to make your own best choic about how to pai for colleg __PUNCT__
we call it __PUNCT__ know befor you ow __PUNCT__
know befor you ow __PUNCT__
that a good idea __PUNCT__
but my oppon want to get rid of thi new consum protect agenc and let for __PUNCT__ profit colleg keep prei on veteran and work famili __PUNCT__
that on of the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that america onc again lead the world in educ our kid __PUNCT__ train our worker __PUNCT__
i want to make sure more of our student ar prepar for colleg by help our secondari and elementari school hire and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg __PUNCT__ learn the skill that local busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
i put colleg and univers on notic __PUNCT__ if thei can't stop tuition from go up __PUNCT__ the fund thei get from taxpay will go down __PUNCT__
we want to give them some incent to start lower tuition __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that what you go to be have to think about when you go to that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis that we would end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
thank to the servic and the sacrific of our incred men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ that what we done __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ all our troop ar out of iraq __PUNCT__
we ar begin to bring our troop home from afghanistan __PUNCT__
but the kei is make sure that thei ar get the same good deal that my grandfath got when he came home from the war __PUNCT__
so we made sure to keep the post __PUNCT__ 9/11 gi bill strong so that everybodi who ha serv our countri ha the chanc to earn a degre __PUNCT__
as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ i promis you we will care for our veteran and serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
if you fought for thi countri __PUNCT__ you shouldn't have to fight for a colleg educ or for a job or for a roof over your head when you come home __PUNCT__
so that what we fight for __PUNCT__ columbu __PUNCT__
that just on exampl __PUNCT__ in the educ arena __PUNCT__ of what at stake __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next 2½ month __PUNCT__ the other side will spend more monei than we have ever seen __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei got folk write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
thei should be contribut that to a scholarship fund to send kid to colleg __PUNCT__
but instead __PUNCT__ thei ar go to spend more monei than we ever seen on ad __PUNCT__
