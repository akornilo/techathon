when we invest in your futur __PUNCT__ we invest in america futur __PUNCT__
the fact is that countri that out __PUNCT__ educ us todai __PUNCT__ thei out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to lose that race to make sure we got the most highli educ __PUNCT__ most skill workforc in the world __PUNCT__
and when compani and busi ar look to locat __PUNCT__ that what thei look for __PUNCT__
and i don't want them look ani farther than reno __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ the state of nevada __PUNCT__ the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__ and i want to keep it that wai __PUNCT__
and your educ is just get more import __PUNCT__
i not tell you anyth you don't know __PUNCT__
more than half of the new job over the next decad will requir some form of higher educ __PUNCT__
and i don't think it also ani new to you that higher educ is get harder and harder to afford __PUNCT__
it is tough for a lot of folk __PUNCT__
over the past coupl of decad __PUNCT__ over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ tuition and fee at america colleg and univers have more than doubl __PUNCT__
the averag student who borrow to pai for colleg now graduat with about __MONEY__ in student loan debt __PUNCT__
and live with that kind of debt mean you got to make tough choic __PUNCT__ especi when you first start out __PUNCT__
it mai mean put off start a famili or bui a home __PUNCT__
it mai mean you don't have enough save to try to start that new busi idea that you got __PUNCT__
when a big chunk of each paycheck goe just toward servic your loan debt __PUNCT__ that not just tough for middl class famili that ar try to make it __PUNCT__ it also not good for the economi __PUNCT__ becaus it mean you not spend that monei with local busi __PUNCT__
and i want you to understand i speak from experi here __PUNCT__
michel and i know about thi firsthand __PUNCT__
we didn't come from wealthi famili __PUNCT__
my mom wa a singl mom __PUNCT__
michel dad wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__
her mom wa a secretari __PUNCT__
michel parent never went to colleg __PUNCT__
both of us graduat from colleg and law school with a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
so when we got marri __PUNCT__ we pool our liabil __PUNCT__ not our asset __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we got poorer __PUNCT__ not richer __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we paid more for our student loan than we paid on our mortgag each month __PUNCT__ when we final were abl to afford to bui a condo __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ onc we had malia and sasha __PUNCT__ now we suppos to be save for their colleg educ __PUNCT__ but we still pai off for our colleg educ __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ we were luckier than most __PUNCT__
we had land good job with steadi incom __PUNCT__
even with that __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ we onli finish pai off our student loan about __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ think about that __PUNCT__
i becam presid 3Â½ year ago __PUNCT__
i wa a u. __PUNCT__ senat about __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
so i had been work and michel had been work for over a decad befor we got all our loan paid off __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ i onli stand here befor you todai becaus of the chanc that that educ gave me __PUNCT__
so i think i can speak with some experi and sai __PUNCT__ make higher educ more afford for young peopl is someth i got a person stake in __PUNCT__
it not someth i believ in abstractli __PUNCT__
it someth michel ha a person stake in __PUNCT__
we believ in it becaus we been in your shoe __PUNCT__
we know what it like __PUNCT__
we understand that unless you provid those rung on the ladder of opportun __PUNCT__ then young peopl __PUNCT__ mani of whom ar more talent than michel and i __PUNCT__ mai not get a shot __PUNCT__
and that why i made thi on of the top prioriti of my presid __PUNCT__
it part of what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
when all of you walk in to that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you go to have a choic __PUNCT__
and part of it is the choic of how we treat educ in thi countri __PUNCT__
and i sai thi becaus put a colleg educ within reach for work famili doe not seem to be a prioriti that my oppon share __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ a few month ago __PUNCT__ governor romnei told a crowd of young peopl __PUNCT__ just like you __PUNCT__ that if you want to be success __PUNCT__ if you want to go to colleg or you want to start a busi __PUNCT__ then you can just __PUNCT__ and i quot here __PUNCT__ borrow monei if you have to from your parent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
harri __PUNCT__ did your parent have a whole bunch of monei to lend you __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
my parent didn't have a lot of monei to lend me __PUNCT__
i bet a bunch of your parent don't have a lot of monei to lend __PUNCT__
it not becaus thei don't want to __PUNCT__ thei don't have it __PUNCT__
when a high school student ask governor romnei what he would do to make colleg more afford for famili __PUNCT__ governor romnei didn't sai anyth about grant or loan program that have help million of student earn a colleg educ __PUNCT__
he didn't sai anyth about work __PUNCT__ studi program or rise colleg tuition __PUNCT__
he did not sai a singl word about commun colleg or how import higher educ is to america econom futur __PUNCT__
here what he said __PUNCT__ the best thing i can do for you is to tell you to shop around __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ to shop around __PUNCT__
so thi is hi plan __PUNCT__
that hi answer to a young person hope to go to colleg __PUNCT__ shop around and borrow monei from your parent if you have to __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that not an answer __PUNCT__
that not an __PUNCT__ not onli is it not a good answer __PUNCT__ it not even an answer __PUNCT__
there is noth a parent want to do more than to give their kid opportun that we never had __PUNCT__
there ar veri few thing more pain than a parent not be abl to do it __PUNCT__
but we still fight back from the worst econom crisi in our lifetim __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of parent out there who ar work realli hard __PUNCT__ but still struggl to make end meet __PUNCT__
and i do not accept the notion that we should deni their children the opportun of a higher educ and a brighter futur just becaus their famili were hard hit by a recess __PUNCT__
think about all the discoveri __PUNCT__ all the busi __PUNCT__ all the breakthrough that we wouldn't have had if we had told everi american that want to go to colleg __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ too bad __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
shop around __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
shop around __PUNCT__
thi countri ha alwai made a commit to put a good educ within the reach of all who ar will to work for it __PUNCT__
that part of what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__
that what kept us at the forefront of busi and scienc and technolog and medicin __PUNCT__
and thi is not just a new commit we made __PUNCT__
my grandfath had the chanc to go to colleg becaus after fight on behalf of america in world war ii __PUNCT__ he came back to a countri that decid __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ we go to make sure everi veteran should be abl to afford colleg __PUNCT__
my mother wa abl to rais me and my sister by herself and go to colleg becaus she wa abl to get grant and work her wai through school __PUNCT__
michel and i would not be here without the help of scholarship and student loan __PUNCT__
we ar onli here becaus the chanc our educ gave us __PUNCT__ and i want everi young person to have that chanc __PUNCT__
and listen __PUNCT__ govern can't help folk who won't help themselv __PUNCT__
parent have to parent __PUNCT__ and young peopl have to stai disciplin and focus __PUNCT__
but if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ a colleg educ in the __NUM__ centuri should be avail to everybodi __PUNCT__ not just the wealthi few __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
whether it a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year educ __PUNCT__ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year program __PUNCT__ higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is a necess __PUNCT__
and everi american famili should be abl to afford it __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
it on of the reason i run for presid __PUNCT__
sinc __PUNCT__ and listen __PUNCT__ i want you to understand __PUNCT__ i not just talk the talk __PUNCT__
i not just make promis __PUNCT__
sinc i took offic __PUNCT__ we help over __NUM__ million more student afford a colleg educ with grant that go farther than thei did befor __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ the econom plan of governor romnei could cut our invest in educ by about __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
so the grant that we us __PUNCT__ that alejandra mai be take advantag of __PUNCT__ mani of you mai be take advantag of __PUNCT__ those grant could be cut so deepli that __NUM__ million of the student who been help __PUNCT__ would no longer get scholarship __PUNCT__
it would cut financi aid for nearli __NUM__ million student a year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ and here the worst part __PUNCT__ thei not make these cut to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
thei not make these cut so thei can creat more job __PUNCT__
thei do it to pai for a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut weight toward the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
doe that sound like a plan for a better futur for you __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it a plan that sai we can't afford to help the next gener __PUNCT__ but we can afford massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__
we can't offer our young peopl student loan becaus we got to protect corpor tax loophol __PUNCT__
it a vision that sai we can't help young peopl who ar try to make it becaus we got to protect the folk who alreadi have made it __PUNCT__
that not a vision we have to accept __PUNCT__
governor romnei like to talk about hi time as an investor as on of the base for hi candidaci __PUNCT__ but hi econom plan make clear he doesn't think your futur is worth invest in __PUNCT__
and i do __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
that the choic thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we ar go to make sure that america onc again lead the world in educ our kid and train our worker __PUNCT__
there ar busi owner across the countri who sai thei can't fill the skill posit thei have open __PUNCT__ and you got a million __PUNCT__ million of peopl who ar out there look for work __PUNCT__
so i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg just like thi on __PUNCT__ to learn the skill that local busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
commun colleg like trucke meadow educ the backbon of our workforc __PUNCT__
thi is where young peopl and some not __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ young peopl can come and get train as nurs and firefight and comput programm and folk who manufactur clean energi compon __PUNCT__
and these ar the vital pathwai to the middl class __PUNCT__ and we shouldn't weaken them __PUNCT__ we should strengthen them __PUNCT__
earlier thi summer __PUNCT__ harri reid and i __PUNCT__ we fought to make sure the interest rate on feder student loan didn't go up __PUNCT__
we won that fight __PUNCT__
the republican plan in congress would have allow those rate to doubl __PUNCT__ cost more than __NUM__ million student an extra thousand dollar a year __PUNCT__
with the help of harri reid __PUNCT__ we set up a colleg tax credit so that more middl class famili can save up to __MONEY__ on their tuition over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to repeal it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis we would reform a student loan system that wa give ten of billion of taxpay dollar to big bank and lobbyist instead of give it to student __PUNCT__
so thei were take a cut out of the student loan program even though thei had no risk becaus the feder govern wa guarante the loan __PUNCT__ __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__ worth __PUNCT__
so we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ let cut them out __PUNCT__ let give thi monei directli to student __PUNCT__
we won that fight __PUNCT__
that what we us to doubl the grant for student who ar in need __PUNCT__
my oppon is run to return the system back to wai it wa __PUNCT__
he want to go backward to polici where bank were take out billion of dollar out of the student loan program __PUNCT__
he want to go back to polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want to move forward __PUNCT__ he want to go backward __PUNCT__
we ar not go to let him __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
and we promis we go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__
we promis to blunt the momentum of the taliban and then start turn over secur respons to the afghan so we can start bring our troop home __PUNCT__
we ar keep these promis becaus of the tremend sacrific of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ all of our troop ar out of iraq __PUNCT__ and we ar wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
but we got to make sure that we keep faith with those folk who fought for us __PUNCT__
so we made sure to keep the post __PUNCT__ 9/11 gi bill strong __PUNCT__
everybodi who ha serv thi countri should have a chanc to get their degre __PUNCT__ and as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ thi countri will care for our veteran and serv them as well as thei have serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or fight for a colleg educ or fight for a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that part of what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i have to tell you __PUNCT__ over the cours of the next 2Â½ month __PUNCT__ the other side will not talk much about educ __PUNCT__ becaus thei don't realli have a plan __PUNCT__
thei won't be talk about much __PUNCT__ but thei will spend more monei than we ever seen on ad that just try to repeat the same thing over and over again __PUNCT__ the economi is not do as well as it should __PUNCT__ and it all obama fault __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it like go to a concert __PUNCT__ and thei just keep on plai the same song over and over again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the reason thei got to try to just repeat that over and over again is becaus thei know their econom plan is not popular __PUNCT__
thei know that the american peopl ar not go to bui anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ most of which goe to wealthi american and that will be paid for by you __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei know gut educ to pai for a massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair is not go to sell __PUNCT__
so sinc thei can't advertis their plan __PUNCT__ thei go to bet on the fact that you get discourag __PUNCT__ that you get cynic __PUNCT__ that you decid your vote doesn't matter __PUNCT__
thei bet that each __MONEY__ million check from some wealthi donor drown out million of voic __PUNCT__
thei don't see that as a problem __PUNCT__ that their strategi __PUNCT__
i count on someth differ __PUNCT__
i count on you __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ part of what you taught me in __NUM__ is that when the american peopl join togeth __PUNCT__ thei can't be stop __PUNCT__
when we rememb our parent and our grandpar and great __PUNCT__ grandpar and all the sacrific thei made and we remind that thi countri ha alwai risen and fallen togeth __PUNCT__ when we rememb that what make us special is the idea that everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ when that our focu __PUNCT__ you can't be stop __PUNCT__
so here what i go to need from everybodi __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ you got no excus not to regist to vote __PUNCT__
we got staff and volunt who ar here __PUNCT__
thei will grab you at the door __PUNCT__
you won't be abl to escap __PUNCT__

you __PUNCT__ gotta __PUNCT__ grab some neighbor __PUNCT__
you __PUNCT__ gotta __PUNCT__ take them to the poll __PUNCT__
you __PUNCT__ gotta __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
let prove the cynic wrong on more time __PUNCT__
let show them your vote count __PUNCT__
let prove your voic is more power than lobbyist and special interest __PUNCT__
let keep the promis of thi countri aliv __PUNCT__ that no matter what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
we got more student to educ __PUNCT__ more teacher to hire __PUNCT__ more troop to bring home __PUNCT__ more school to rebuild __PUNCT__ more good job to creat __PUNCT__ more homegrown energi to gener __PUNCT__ more door of opportun to open for everybodi who will to work hard __PUNCT__
