now __PUNCT__ both side have now made their argument __PUNCT__
the other gui __PUNCT__ thei came down to florida __PUNCT__ and so now you know what the choic is __PUNCT__ and you got a big choic to make __PUNCT__
and i honestli believ thi is the clearest choic of ani time in a gener __PUNCT__
it is not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__ it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__ it a choic between two differ path for america __PUNCT__ two differ vision for our futur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here what __PUNCT__ here our vision __PUNCT__
we fight to restor that basic bargain that built the largest middl class the world ha ever known __PUNCT__ that built the greatest economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and the whole bargain is real simpl __PUNCT__ the promis that if you work hard __PUNCT__ it will pai off __PUNCT__ the promis that if you act respons __PUNCT__ you be reward __PUNCT__ that everybodi in thi countri get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from main street to wall street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some of you know i start my career in public servic work in the shadow of steel mill that had close and work with folk try to rebuild their neighborhood __PUNCT__
and that process of job disappear oversea __PUNCT__ famili struggl with the cost that keep on go up even though their paycheck aren't go up __PUNCT__ peopl take more and more debt just to pai for tuition or ga or food on the tabl __PUNCT__ that process had been go on for a decad __PUNCT__
and then it culmin in the worst financi crisi and depress we had __PUNCT__ or recess that we had sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and million of peopl lost their job __PUNCT__ lost their home __PUNCT__ lost their save __PUNCT__
and it that tragedi that we been fight to recov from ever sinc __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we made progress __PUNCT__
but we know we haven't made enough __PUNCT__
we got more work to do __PUNCT__
nobodi is satisfi with the statu quo __PUNCT__
there ar too mani folk out there who still need a job __PUNCT__ too mani folk whose home ar still underwat __PUNCT__
we got a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
and the question is not whether we need to make more progress __PUNCT__
the question is how do we do it __PUNCT__ our friend at the republican convent were more than happi to talk about everyth thei think is wrong with america __PUNCT__ but thei didn't have much to sai about how to make it right __PUNCT__
thei want your vote __PUNCT__ but thei don't want you to know their plan __PUNCT__
that becaus thei offer the same wornout plan that thei had for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ roll back some regul __PUNCT__ and then let have some more tax cut __PUNCT__
tax cut when time ar good __PUNCT__
tax cut when time ar bad __PUNCT__
tax cut to lose an extra few pound __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ tax cut to improv your love life __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ whatev the issu __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ when i said that at the last stop we had __PUNCT__ in st __PUNCT__ petersburg __PUNCT__ a gui yell out in the crowd __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ it didn't work __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ i cut tax for folk who need it __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis that we would lower the tax burden on middl class famili __PUNCT__ and the typic famili is pai __MONEY__ less in feder tax compar to when i came into offic __PUNCT__
we cut tax for small busi __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
but i don't believ that anoth round of tax break for millionair is go to bring back job from oversea or bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
i don't think that fire teacher is go to strengthen our economi __PUNCT__ or i don't believ kick student off of financi aid will help us compet against engin come out of china __PUNCT__
i sure don't believ __PUNCT__ after everyth we gone through with the crash on wall street __PUNCT__ that roll back regul on wall street somehow is go to help local busi here in florida or strengthen our hous market __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__
we have tri that __PUNCT__
it didn't work __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__
we not go back __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we go forward __PUNCT__
we go forward __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i won't __PUNCT__ i will not pretend that the path i offer is easi or quick __PUNCT__
i didn't promis in __NUM__ that it wa go to be easi or quick __PUNCT__ becaus these problem have been go on for decad __PUNCT__
bill clinton made that point on wednesdai night __PUNCT__
he said you can't expect that we go to solv these massiv challeng that we been deal with for year overnight __PUNCT__
but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ we will solv these problem __PUNCT__
you got my oppon and hi vice presid sai the nation in declin __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't know whether thei sai that just becaus thei want to win some vote or becaus thei actual believ it __PUNCT__
but either wai __PUNCT__ thei wrong __PUNCT__
america ha got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best research __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__ and the best colleg __PUNCT__
we ar a young nation __PUNCT__
we got a divers of talent just like you see in thi auditorium __PUNCT__
peopl ar come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
why do you think thei want to come here __PUNCT__ becaus thei know that no matter what the other side sai __PUNCT__ no matter how dark thei try to paint the pictur __PUNCT__ most folk __PUNCT__ thei would do anyth to have a chanc to be right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so our problem can be solv __PUNCT__
our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
the path we offer is harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
and i ask you to choos that futur __PUNCT__
i ask you to ralli not around me __PUNCT__ but ralli around a set of goal for our countri in manufactur and educ and energi __PUNCT__ nation secur __PUNCT__ reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
i got a plan that will lead to new job and more opportun and rebuild thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
and we can keep make the kind of progress that need over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ which is the reason i run for a second term __PUNCT__ becaus i confid we can get to where we need to go __PUNCT__
i confid about it __PUNCT__
but in case you miss it __PUNCT__ in case you miss what i said __PUNCT__ what dai wa that __PUNCT__ thursdai __PUNCT__ what todai __PUNCT__ what dai is it todai __PUNCT__ is it saturdai __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ i just on the road all the time __PUNCT__
i forget what date it is __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ so it wa thursdai __PUNCT__ now it saturdai __PUNCT__
in case you miss it on thursdai __PUNCT__ let me sai again what our plan is __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ i got a plan to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
so after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ thi countri creat over half a million new manufactur job in the last 2½ year __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
you can go along with the plan you heard in tampa and give more tax break to corpor that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can start give tax break to compani that ar open new plant and train new worker and creat new job here in florida __PUNCT__ in kissimme __PUNCT__ here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that my plan __PUNCT__
we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ here in florida __PUNCT__ you the gatewai for an entir market in latin america __PUNCT__ which is why when you hear these folk talk about the recoveri act and he didn't do thi and he didn't do that __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ we expand port and infrastructur here in florida precis becaus we can export more __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ becaus we sell good around the world stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in the u.s.a __PUNCT__ made in the u.s.a __PUNCT__ made in the u.s.a __PUNCT__ that part on of our plan __PUNCT__ make it here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__
so you got a choic on that issu __PUNCT__
let me give you anoth choic __PUNCT__
we need to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will get twice as __PUNCT__ go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__
we doubl our us of renew energi __PUNCT__ which is not onli produc power for busi and home here in florida __PUNCT__ but it also creat thousand of job build wind turbin and solar panel and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
so we __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ we made progress __PUNCT__
and now the big idea come out of tampa wa to revers the progress we made __PUNCT__
that option on __PUNCT__
option two is to build on that progress __PUNCT__
so unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
i not go to let them continu to collect __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__
we want to keep invest in wind and solar and cleaner coal __PUNCT__
and we want farmer and scientist to har new biofuel to power our car and our truck __PUNCT__
we want to put construct worker back to work rebuild factori and home so thei more energi effici __PUNCT__ so thei wast less energi __PUNCT__
we can develop a hundr year __PUNCT__ suppli of natur ga that beneath our feet here in the unit state __PUNCT__
and if you choos the path i offer __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and we can support __NUM__ new job just in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
but that path is open onli if you take it through your vote __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ so that two __PUNCT__
number three __PUNCT__ i got a plan to give more american the chanc to gain the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa a __PUNCT__ wa the kei to opportun for me __PUNCT__
it wa the kei for michel __PUNCT__
it wa the kei for mani of you __PUNCT__
it the gatewai to a middl class life __PUNCT__
so what have we alreadi done __PUNCT__ for the first time in a gener __PUNCT__ nearli everi state ha answer our call to rais their standard for teach and learn __PUNCT__
some of the worst school in the countri have made real gain in math and read __PUNCT__
million of student ar pai less for colleg becaus we stop us bank and lender as middlemen for student loan __PUNCT__ save billion of dollar __PUNCT__ and sent that directli to student to help million get a better educ and not have as much debt __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you got a choic __PUNCT__
we could revers some of those thing that we done __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can decid in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have their dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom __PUNCT__
no famili should be excit about a colleg accept letter and then realiz __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ honei __PUNCT__ we can't afford to send you there __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find worker here in florida or here in the unit state that had the skill thei need __PUNCT__
so my path is let recruit and train anoth hundr thousand math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__
let improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
let give __NUM__ million more worker the chanc to get better skill at commun colleg __PUNCT__ skill that will lead directli to a job __PUNCT__
and let work with colleg and univers to cut in half the growth in tuition so that everybodi can afford it __PUNCT__
we can meet that goal togeth __PUNCT__
these ar achiev goal __PUNCT__
that the path i want you to choos __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ we need to reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
it import for us to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
it import for us to do it in a respons wai __PUNCT__
we don't have to do it all at onc __PUNCT__ but we got to get start on it __PUNCT__
an independ analysi show that my plan would cut our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
and i work with republican in congress to cut a trillion dollar in spend alreadi __PUNCT__ and i readi to do more __PUNCT__
i want to reform the tax code so that it is simpl and so that it is fair __PUNCT__
i want to get rid of program that don't work __PUNCT__
i want to consolid some agenc so thei more effici and more custom friendli __PUNCT__
but i also want to ask the wealthiest household to pai a littl bit higher tax on incom over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ over __MONEY__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ let sai you make a million dollar __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that sound good to you __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ you still keep your tax cut for the first __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so it not like you not get ani relief at all __PUNCT__
the first __NUM__ you still get your tax break __PUNCT__
but for everi dollar you make after __NUM__ we go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ when our economi creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ when we had all kind of small busi succeed and start up __PUNCT__ when we had the biggest surplu in histori and a lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason why thi work is becaus thi whole top __PUNCT__ down thing doesn't work __PUNCT__
if you give a teacher or a construct worker or a receptionist __PUNCT__ just work folk __PUNCT__ if you give them a littl more monei __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and if thei spend it __PUNCT__ then busi have more custom __PUNCT__
and then busi make more profit __PUNCT__
and then the busi sai __PUNCT__ let build anoth plant and let hire more worker __PUNCT__
and now everyth get roll in a posit direct __PUNCT__
so that how we build an economi __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
it help everybodi when you do it that wai __PUNCT__
and if you concern about the deficit __PUNCT__ the first thing you should be concern about is grow the economi __PUNCT__
but let sai even if all you were think about is how do we close the deficit gap __PUNCT__ as presid clinton point out __PUNCT__ the thing that miss from my oppon plan is arithmet __PUNCT__
it doesn't add up __PUNCT__
he sai that we can give a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ mostli to wealthi individu __PUNCT__ and that somehow the deficit go to get smaller __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ how do you think that go to work __PUNCT__ that not go to work __PUNCT__
that not go to work __PUNCT__
and the onli wai it doe work is if you ar gut educ __PUNCT__ you stop __PUNCT__ you not invest in basic scienc and research __PUNCT__ where we not rebuild our infrastructur and we ar frai our safeti net and we voucher medicar __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and mayb __PUNCT__ to top it off __PUNCT__ we increas tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that doesn't sound like a good plan __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it doesn't add up __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ it doe not add up to job either __PUNCT__
some peopl look at romnei plan __PUNCT__ and thei said __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ thi actual would make the recoveri slower __PUNCT__
slower __PUNCT__
i refus to let that happen __PUNCT__
i refus to let that happen __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for a tax cut for me __PUNCT__
i not go to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick kid off head start program or elimin health insur for the poor and the elderli and the disabl so those with the most can pai less __PUNCT__
and i want you to know __PUNCT__ aarp __PUNCT__ i want you to know i will never turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
these gui ar out there run these ad about how somehow we weaken medicar __PUNCT__
we strengthen medicar __PUNCT__ extend it life for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
don't take my word for it __PUNCT__ aarp sai the same thing __PUNCT__
becaus i believ no american should ever have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
after a lifetim of labor __PUNCT__ you should retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
you earn it __PUNCT__
so we do have to reform and we will strengthen medicar over the long haul __PUNCT__ but we go to do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
and we go to keep the promis of social secur __PUNCT__
we take respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ not by turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there on last point i want to make __PUNCT__ and that about foreign polici __PUNCT__ becaus these thing ar connect __PUNCT__
our prosper at home is link to our polici abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
while a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ as we come up on __DATE__ we know that al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
so i want you to know __PUNCT__ as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
when our troop take off the uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv america __PUNCT__
nobodi who fight for thi countri should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon got a differ view __PUNCT__
he said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ for me to end the war in iraq as i did __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i did it anywai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ didn't even mention it in hi speech at hi convent __PUNCT__
my oppon would spend more monei on militari program that our joint chief don't even want __PUNCT__ won't make us safer __PUNCT__
i go to us that monei we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__
let do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that will make us safer __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
there a choic on everi issu __PUNCT__
over and over we been told by the other side that bigger tax cut __PUNCT__ fewer regul __PUNCT__ thei the onli wai to go __PUNCT__ that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their basic theori is if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ don't get sick __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
a compani releas pollut in the air that our children breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford colleg __PUNCT__ take their advic and ask your parent if you can borrow the monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i got a differ idea __PUNCT__ becaus i don't think that what our countri is about __PUNCT__
we insist on hard work and person respons and individu initi __PUNCT__
and we know we not entitl to success __PUNCT__ we got to earn it __PUNCT__
we honor the striver and the dreamer and the entrepreneur __PUNCT__ the risk taker who alwai been the drive forc behind our free enterpris system __PUNCT__
and we believ it __PUNCT__ that free enterpris system is the greatest engin of growth and prosper the world ever known __PUNCT__
that what attract peopl to our shore __PUNCT__
but we also believ that the market doesn't work __PUNCT__ thi countri doesn't work __PUNCT__ unless we accept certain oblig to on anoth __PUNCT__ unless we think about futur gener __PUNCT__ unless we believ in someth call citizenship __PUNCT__ that we understand america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ it about what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and on peopl __PUNCT__
so the elect __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ it wasn't about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you __PUNCT__
you the chang __PUNCT__
the american peopl rose up __PUNCT__ and as a result of what you did __PUNCT__ senior across florida ar save an averag of __MONEY__ everi year on prescript drug __PUNCT__
that becaus of obamacar __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason a woman in doral __PUNCT__ who is alreadi work full time dure the dai __PUNCT__ now can afford to go to school at night becaus she got the financi aid that she need __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason there a work famili over in hollywood who wa abl to save their home from foreclosur and keep their piec of the american dream __PUNCT__
you made that possibl __PUNCT__
you the reason that a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason why we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
you the reason why our troop ar come home __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
don't let anybodi tell you you can't make a differ __PUNCT__
don't let anybodi tell you that somehow you have no influenc __PUNCT__ that you can't chang the system __PUNCT__
we mai not be abl to chang everyth all at onc just the wai we want it __PUNCT__ becaus thi is a big __PUNCT__ complex democraci __PUNCT__ and not everybodi ha got a same opinion __PUNCT__
and there noth wrong with that __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ sometim thing get tangl up in washington __PUNCT__ and sometim it frustrat and chang isn't happen the wai it should __PUNCT__
but whenev the american peopl stand up __PUNCT__ whenev you get involv __PUNCT__ whenev you particip __PUNCT__ then amaz thing happen __PUNCT__ becaus the american peopl have great instinct __PUNCT__
you ar a good and decent peopl __PUNCT__
and so if you turn awai now __PUNCT__ if you turn awai now __PUNCT__ and you bui into the cynic that you won't make a differ __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ chang won't happen __PUNCT__
you know who will fill the void __PUNCT__ who will step in where you should have been __PUNCT__ lobbyist __PUNCT__ special interest __PUNCT__ the folk write the __MONEY__ million check try to bui thi elect __PUNCT__ the folk who ar try to make it harder for peopl to vote __PUNCT__
