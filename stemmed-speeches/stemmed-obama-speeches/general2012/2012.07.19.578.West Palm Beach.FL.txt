__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ sometim __PUNCT__ it would be rain __PUNCT__ and i be try to find my umbrella __PUNCT__
by the time i got into the event __PUNCT__ i be soak __PUNCT__
but i have such great memori of those first campaign __PUNCT__
and the reason is becaus everywher i went __PUNCT__ and illinoi is a big state __PUNCT__ so you go to inner citi and farm town and suburb and peopl of everi walk of life __PUNCT__ everywher i went __PUNCT__ i hear peopl stori __PUNCT__
and those stori remind me of my own stori __PUNCT__
so if i saw a coupl that wa __NUM__ or __NUM__ and i think about my grandpar who fought in world war ii __PUNCT__ my grandfath fought in world war ii and my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when my grandfath came home __PUNCT__ he wa abl to get a colleg educ becaus of the gi bill and wa abl to bui their first home us the __PUNCT__ with the help of the fha __PUNCT__
and i wa remind of that greatest gener __PUNCT__ everyth thei did on behalf of build thi great countri that we live in __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
and we still here __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
there you go __PUNCT__
and then if i met a singl mom __PUNCT__ i think about my own mom __PUNCT__
my dad left when i wa an infant and so i didn't know him __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ and my mom didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ but with the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__ she wa abl to work and put herself through school and then give a great educ to me and my sister __PUNCT__
and i think about how thi countri is so great becaus peopl have opportun __PUNCT__ even if thei don't come from a fanci background __PUNCT__
and i meet a work coupl __PUNCT__ and i think about michel parent __PUNCT__
michel dad had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ ms __PUNCT__
and by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__ had to us two cane and had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els to get dress to get to work __PUNCT__
he work as a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker at the water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai of work __PUNCT__
and michel mom work as a secretari __PUNCT__
but with those modest job __PUNCT__ thei were abl to look after michel and her brother and end up send them to some of the best colleg and univers in the countri __PUNCT__
and i thought about how that stori wa true for so mani other famili all across illinoi __PUNCT__
and then when i began to run for presid __PUNCT__ i realiz that wa true all across america __PUNCT__
and so the thing that i love __PUNCT__ at thi point __PUNCT__ a cell phone rang __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
who call __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ is that michel __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that becaus she heard all those women were kiss me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ she got a littl nervou __PUNCT__
she feel a littl jealou __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but what all these stori remind me of is that all across america __PUNCT__ peopl of everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter where you come from __PUNCT__ there thi central idea that make thi countri great __PUNCT__ the idea that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your faith __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
you can get ahead __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
american __PUNCT__ we don't want handout __PUNCT__
we want to work for what we earn __PUNCT__ but we do want hard work to pai off __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we do expect that __PUNCT__ if you will to put in the effort __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai a live wage __PUNCT__
you shouldn't go broke just becaus you get sick __PUNCT__
you should be abl to send your kid to a good school __PUNCT__
you should retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and you should be abl to provid your children and __PUNCT__ hopefulli __PUNCT__ your grandchildren with opportun that you might not even have imagin __PUNCT__ that thei go to do even better than you did __PUNCT__
that what america is all about __PUNCT__
that at the heart of the american idea __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i ran in __NUM__ becaus that basic bargain __PUNCT__ that belief that hard work should pai off __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ it seem as if that simpl american dream wa at risk like never befor __PUNCT__
for more than a decad __PUNCT__ it had been slip awai from too mani hardwork peopl __PUNCT__
job and factori were ship oversea __PUNCT__
folk at the veri top were do better than ever befor __PUNCT__ but the middl class __PUNCT__ the folk who ar the heartbeat of thi countri __PUNCT__ for middl class famili and those try to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ it seem as if paycheck were get smaller and bill were get bigger __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ in washington trillion of dollar were spent on two war and tax cut __PUNCT__ and we went from record surplus to record deficit __PUNCT__
and on wall street __PUNCT__ you had a cultur of anyth goe that led to reckless bet and ultim result in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
ever sinc i ran for offic __PUNCT__ i said that it go to take more than on year or on term or even on presid to solv some of these problem __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and let __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ let face it __PUNCT__ there so much more work to do __PUNCT__
thi crisi made thing that much tougher __PUNCT__
and when you go through someth as bad as anyth sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ it a challeng to make sure that we get the economi move and everybodi is back to work and peopl properti valu and their home ar back to where thei need to be __PUNCT__
but when i hear peopl sai that somehow our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ i tell them __PUNCT__ you don't know the american peopl __PUNCT__ the courag __PUNCT__ the charact __PUNCT__ the determin of the american peopl __PUNCT__
becaus as i travel across the countri and i meet a small busi person who sacrif some of their own perk and mayb even their own pai to make sure that thei could keep all those famili on the job __PUNCT__ or when i talk about some of autowork in michigan and ohio __PUNCT__ who were never suppos to be build car again __PUNCT__ but now can't build them fast enough __PUNCT__ when i meet men and women in their 50 who go back to commun colleg __PUNCT__ sit with a bunch of __NUM__ year old becaus thei don't give up just becaus thei got laid off and thei retrain and suddenli thei find new job in health care or medic technolog or in some advanc manufactur __PUNCT__ that spirit __PUNCT__ that understand that we mai get knock down __PUNCT__ but we alwai get back up and that we alwai believ in our capac to bring about the kind of chang that keep america move __PUNCT__ that tenac and determin __PUNCT__ that undiminish __PUNCT__
it still there __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
prais the lord __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it is still there __PUNCT__
and so there mai not be ani quick fix and easi solut to some of the challeng we face __PUNCT__ but we go to fix them __PUNCT__
i have everi bit of confid __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the problem we have right now is not that we don't have good idea for thing like hous and educ and make sure that we bring down our deficit and protect senior __PUNCT__ medicar and social secur __PUNCT__
the problem is not that we don't know how to do it __PUNCT__
the problem is we got a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we got the best scientist __PUNCT__
we got the best univers __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur __PUNCT__
we got the best system __PUNCT__
we got more divers and ingenu and talent come from everi part of the globe __PUNCT__
so everi other countri on earth __PUNCT__ thei be happi to trade place with us __PUNCT__
but we do have thi stalem in washington becaus there ar a group of folk who want us to go backward __PUNCT__
i don't believ in go backward __PUNCT__ i believ in go forward __PUNCT__
i believ in go forward __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i want us to go forward __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi friend in congress __PUNCT__ thei got an econom plan __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
their econom don't work __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it sound like you heard the plan __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ their plan is to cut tax more for the wealthi __PUNCT__ cut more regul on bank and insur compani and unscrupul lender __PUNCT__ and cut more invest in thing like educ and research and hope that somehow all that is go to creat more prosper for everybodi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that a good theori if we hadn't just tri it __PUNCT__
we tri it for a decad befor i got elect __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
it got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
i think most of you __PUNCT__ like most of america __PUNCT__ understand that america work best not with top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ but with a middl __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__ with a bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
when everybodi ha opportun __PUNCT__ then everybodi doe well __PUNCT__ includ those at the top __PUNCT__
that how we becam the most prosper nation on earth __PUNCT__
that how we built the greatest middl class in histori __PUNCT__
and it becaus i want to restor that basic bargain that i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i run becaus i don't believ that you can reduc the deficit without ask the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ includ __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ folk like me __PUNCT__ to give up the tax cut that thei been benefit from for the last decad __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't want to just keep those tax cut __PUNCT__
he want to pile on anoth __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut __PUNCT__ includ a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ percent tax cut for everi millionair in the countri __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but wait __PUNCT__ it get better __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ to pai for thi __PUNCT__ he have to gut job train program for worker __PUNCT__ financi aid for our student __PUNCT__
he potenti have to rais tax on the middl class __PUNCT__ the folk who can least afford it __PUNCT__
he want to roll back the afford care act __PUNCT__ health care reform __PUNCT__ forc __NUM__ floridian to pai more for their prescript drug __PUNCT__
he plan to turn medicar into a voucher program __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ understand how that work __PUNCT__
if the voucher isn't worth what it take to bui health insur in the privat marketplac __PUNCT__ you out of luck __PUNCT__
you got to make up the differ __PUNCT__
you on your own __PUNCT__
so on independ __PUNCT__ nonpartisan studi found that under a similar plan __PUNCT__ senior would have to pai nearli __MONEY__ for medicar than thei do todai __PUNCT__
where ar you go to get that from __PUNCT__ where ar you go to get it from __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ how mani peopl here want to __PUNCT__ think that a good idea __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ to financ tax cut for folk who don't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ that is wrong __PUNCT__
it wrong to ask you to pai more for medicar so that peopl who ar do well right now get even more __PUNCT__
that no wai to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be squeez more monei out of our senior __PUNCT__
my plan is to squeez more monei out of the health care system that is be wast with wast and abus and fraud __PUNCT__
and we been __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ crack down on medicar fraud harder than just about anybodi becaus those dollar should be go to you and your care __PUNCT__ not to folk who ar cheat the system __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we go to cut __PUNCT__ and look __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ there ar some govern program that don't work __PUNCT__
and we can't afford to wast monei __PUNCT__ so we alreadi made a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of cut __PUNCT__
we will to cut spend on stuff that is not help the middl class and not help us grow __PUNCT__
but we also got to balanc that by make sure that everybodi do their fair share __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ just like we tri their wai and it didn't work __PUNCT__ the wai i talk about __PUNCT__ we tri that too __PUNCT__ under a gui name bill clinton __PUNCT__
and we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and we had a surplu instead of a deficit __PUNCT__ and medicar wa protect __PUNCT__ and social secur wa protect __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ wealthi peopl did pretti well too __PUNCT__
becaus when middl class famili ar do well and thei got a littl monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ that mean thei spend it with the local restaur and the local busi __PUNCT__
so suddenli __PUNCT__ busi have more custom and thei start hire more worker __PUNCT__
and you get a virtuou cycl where everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that the recip for success __PUNCT__
but thi isn't the onli place where i got a differ with mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we talk about the auto industri __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
romnei said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
there were a million job at stake __PUNCT__
so i said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
let bet on american manufactur __PUNCT__
and now gm is number on again __PUNCT__
and chrysler and ford ar on the move __PUNCT__
the auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so i want to make sure that what we did with the auto industri __PUNCT__ let do it with manufactur all across the countri __PUNCT__ right here in florida __PUNCT__ all across the countri __PUNCT__
let put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
and on of the wai we can do it is instead of give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ let give tax break to compani that ar invest here in the unit state and hire american worker __PUNCT__
i want to sell good around the world made in america __PUNCT__
that what i believ in __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i run becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time for us to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
america is safer and more respect becaus of the unbeliev servic of our troop __PUNCT__
and becaus of their effort __PUNCT__ we end the war in iraq as i promis __PUNCT__
we been abl to refocu on al qaida and those who caus 9/11 __PUNCT__ and we have decim their leadership and taken out bin laden __PUNCT__
we been abl to set a timelin to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and we strengthen our allianc and stood with countri that share our valu __PUNCT__
i know a lot of peopl in thi commun care about the state of israel __PUNCT__ and we ar heartbroken __PUNCT__ and it an import time to talk about thi becaus of these barbar attack that happen in bulgaria __PUNCT__ young peopl be kill becaus of thi ruthless terrorist attack __PUNCT__
and i want everybodi here to know __PUNCT__ under my administr __PUNCT__ we haven't just preserv the unbreak bond with israel __PUNCT__ we have strengthen it __PUNCT__
we stood by israel side in the face of critic __PUNCT__
our militari and intellig cooper ha never been closer __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ thi is a moment of great uncertainti in the middl east given what happen in syria and what happen in other place __PUNCT__
so now is the time to make sure that we ar do everyth we can to protect israel secur __PUNCT__
and i want you to know that that someth that should transcend parti __PUNCT__
that not a republican or a democrat issu __PUNCT__ that is an issu of how we work with on of our closest alli in the world that share our valu and believ in democraci __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the good new is our allianc ar stronger and our homeland is safer becaus of the courag of our arm forc __PUNCT__
but that also mean that we got to take care of our own respons __PUNCT__
the idea that anybodi who wore the uniform of the unit state arm forc is homeless right now is unaccept __PUNCT__
the notion that thei should be fight for a job or a roof over their head after have fought for us is unaccept __PUNCT__
and that why we ar go to meet that sacr trust and make sure everi veteran get the care that thei have earn and the servic that thei have earn __PUNCT__
that on of the reason i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so there more __PUNCT__ there more __PUNCT__ more work to do __PUNCT__
i want to take about half of the save that we been spend on war __PUNCT__ let rebuild america __PUNCT__
let put worker back to work rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ rebuild our port __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i just took a step todai that will save __PUNCT__ shave year off of the renov of the jacksonvil port __PUNCT__
all across florida __PUNCT__ there ar port that ar gatewai for trade and commerc and job __PUNCT__ and we want to acceler those thing __PUNCT__
and it import for the local economi __PUNCT__ but it also import for the american economi __PUNCT__
we us to have the best stuff __PUNCT__ the best airport __PUNCT__ the best road __PUNCT__ the best everyth __PUNCT__
but we been slip becaus we haven't been make those invest __PUNCT__
and you know what happen when you defer mainten __PUNCT__
if you don't fix the roof __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ that go to cost you more later on __PUNCT__
why wouldn't we want to put some folk back to work right now rebuild america __PUNCT__ that good for the economi __PUNCT__
it good for our futur __PUNCT__
i run to make sure america onc again ha the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
i want our school to hire and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to get train at commun colleg for the job that local busi ar hire right now __PUNCT__
i want colleg and univers to bring down their tuition so that young peopl aren't load up with debt __PUNCT__
higher educ isn't a luxuri anymor __PUNCT__ it an econom necess __PUNCT__
it mai not be at a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year colleg __PUNCT__ but __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ you need an advanc degre of some sort to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
and we got to make it afford for all of our young peopl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ we got a lot of differ __PUNCT__ and i just mention a few __PUNCT__
here in florida __PUNCT__ we all still concern that the hous market is weak __PUNCT__
you start to see some sign of life around the countri __PUNCT__ but it still __PUNCT__ a lot of home underwat __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan is to just let the market bottom out __PUNCT__
that hi plan __PUNCT__
that not a solut __PUNCT__ that a problem __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we alreadi help million of respons homeown refin at histor low rate __PUNCT__ refin their mortgag __PUNCT__ so i run to make sure that everybodi can refin and save about __MONEY__ monei in your pocket that you can us either to build back the equiti in your home or spend it at a local busi __PUNCT__ which will further strengthen the economi __PUNCT__
that a differ between me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
i believ it wa the right thing to do to pass health care reform __PUNCT__
all of you know what it mean to have secur when it come to your health care __PUNCT__
a lot of folk here mai alreadi be on medicar __PUNCT__
but imagin if you had been unlucki and end up get laid off at the ag of __NUM__ or __NUM__ and mayb you alreadi had an ill __PUNCT__ and now you try to get back in the workforc __PUNCT__ but it take a long time __PUNCT__
and you lose your health insur __PUNCT__
or you get a job that doesn't offer you health insur __PUNCT__
or mayb you a small busi person and you got to go into the individu market __PUNCT__ and it turn out that becaus of a preexist condit __PUNCT__ you can't get it or it cost so much you could never even afford it __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
so that why we pass the afford care act __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha now spoken __PUNCT__ and we ar go to implement thi plan becaus we move forward __PUNCT__ we not go backward __PUNCT__
we not go to go backward when it come to tell outstand servicememb that thei can't serv thi countri thei love just becaus of who thei love __PUNCT__
we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we not go backward when it come to the need for immigr reform __PUNCT__
we a nation of law __PUNCT__ but we also a nation of immigr __PUNCT__
and so we need to have a smart system that sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ those who ar will to work hard and act respons __PUNCT__ you got a chanc to succe here in america just like previou gener __PUNCT__
and all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it bring manufactur or construct job back or protect your health care or make sure your grandkid can stai on your __PUNCT__ their parent health insur plan if thei don't have a job that provid health insur or make sure that our veteran ar care for or make sure that young peopl can afford colleg __PUNCT__ all these thing go back to that origin idea __PUNCT__ the idea that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it in thi countri __PUNCT__
you can get ahead __PUNCT__
that the promis that our parent and our grandpar made to us __PUNCT__
and that what we now have to pass on to our kid and grandkid __PUNCT__
and so over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side is go to spend more monei than we ever seen __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and thei have a bunch of ad with scari voic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and most of what you hear __PUNCT__ you can pretti much just go mute __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ just press the mute button __PUNCT__
that the good thing about the remot __PUNCT__
or you can us the dvr and fast forward __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the reason you don't realli have to pai much attent is becaus these ad ar go to sai the same thing over and over again __PUNCT__
thei know __PUNCT__ the other side know thei can't sell their econom plan __PUNCT__ becaus we tri it and it didn't work __PUNCT__
and everybodi rememb that __PUNCT__
so instead __PUNCT__ what thei go to sai is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ the economi is still bad and it obama fault __PUNCT__
that their messag over and over again __PUNCT__
so it doesn't matter what on the screen __PUNCT__
you know that what thei sai __PUNCT__
plu __PUNCT__ some of the pictur of me will be unflatt __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ my face is all a littl distort __PUNCT__ on ey is all droopi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ i look all grim __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so you know what thei sai __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that mai be a wai __PUNCT__ that mai be their plan to win an elect __PUNCT__
