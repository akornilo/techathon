for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we had a presid who share these belief __PUNCT__ a gui name bill clinton __PUNCT__
and so our belief were put to the test __PUNCT__
hi econom plan ask the wealthiest american to pai a littl bit more so we could continu to invest in our peopl __PUNCT__ continu to invest in idea and innov __PUNCT__ invest in our infrastructur __PUNCT__
and at the time __PUNCT__ the republican congress and a senat candid by the name of mitt romnei __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__

but at the time __PUNCT__ mitt romnei said bill clinton plan would hurt the economi and kill job __PUNCT__
it turn out __PUNCT__ hi math back then wa just as bad as it is todai __PUNCT__
becaus by the end of presid clinton second term __PUNCT__ america had creat __NUM__ million new job and incom were up and poverti wa down and our deficit becam the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__
so our idea were tri and test __PUNCT__ and thei work __PUNCT__
their idea were also tri __PUNCT__ and thei didn't work out so well __PUNCT__
becaus rememb __PUNCT__ in the __NUM__ year after bill clinton left offic __PUNCT__ thei tri thi top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ thei tri thi you __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ your __PUNCT__ own econom __PUNCT__

so we tri our idea __PUNCT__ thei work __PUNCT__
we tri their idea __PUNCT__ didn't work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ governor romnei __PUNCT__ he a veri gift salesman __PUNCT__
so he been try in thi campaign __PUNCT__ as hard as he can __PUNCT__ to repackag these idea that didn't work __PUNCT__ the veri same polici that did not work __PUNCT__ and he try to pretend that thei chang __PUNCT__
have you heard him __PUNCT__ he go around sai __PUNCT__ i the candid of chang __PUNCT__
except when you look at the polici __PUNCT__ thei the same on that didn't work __PUNCT__

give more power to the biggest bank __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that favor the wealthi is not chang __PUNCT__
refus to answer question about the detail of your polici until after the elect __PUNCT__ not chang __PUNCT__

that exactli what we need to chang __PUNCT__
kind of massag the fact when thei inconveni to your campaign __PUNCT__ that definit not chang __PUNCT__
that the oldest trick in the book __PUNCT__
that what governor romnei ha been do these last few week __PUNCT__
you been see it __PUNCT__
right here in ohio __PUNCT__ folk who work at the jeep plant have been have to call up their employ becaus thei worri __PUNCT__ thei ask if their job ar be ship to china __PUNCT__
and the reason thei worri is becaus thei saw ad run by governor romnei sai jeep plant were go to be ship job to china __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ it turn out __PUNCT__ it not true __PUNCT__
the car compani themselv have told governor romnei to knock it off __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ knock it off __PUNCT__
that what thei said __PUNCT__
gm __PUNCT__ gener motor said __PUNCT__ we think creat job in the unit state should be a sourc of bipartisan pride __PUNCT__
that what thei said __PUNCT__ and thei right __PUNCT__
i couldn't agre more __PUNCT__
and i understand governor romnei ha a tough time here in ohio becaus he wa against save the auto industri __PUNCT__
and the auto industri account for on out of eight job here in ohio __PUNCT__
so i get that it a problem for him __PUNCT__
but you can't run awai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ dai befor an elect __PUNCT__ run awai from that posit __PUNCT__ especi when you on videotap sai the word __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
you said it __PUNCT__
and you can't try to scare peopl __PUNCT__
listen __PUNCT__ thi is not a game __PUNCT__
these ar peopl job __PUNCT__
these ar peopl live __PUNCT__
the auto industri __PUNCT__ thei spend a lot of monei advertis and brand and let folk know that we back and we here in america and we make american car with american worker __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ suddenli __PUNCT__ you got a gui go out there sai someth that not true __PUNCT__ you don't scare hardwork american just to scare up some vote __PUNCT__
that not what be presid is about __PUNCT__
when i first made the decis to rescu the auto industri __PUNCT__ some of you don't rememb thi __PUNCT__ but it wa not veri popular __PUNCT__
even in ohio and michigan __PUNCT__ it wasn't popular __PUNCT__ but i knew it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
bet on american worker wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
bet on american ingenu and know __PUNCT__ how and manufactur __PUNCT__ that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
