but i can tell you thi __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ thi is america __PUNCT__
our problem can be solv __PUNCT__ and our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best businesspeopl and entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
there not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so the path i offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
i offer a practic __PUNCT__ five __PUNCT__ point plan to creat job and grow the middl class and rebuild the economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
so let me break it down in case you gui miss the convent __PUNCT__ just in case __PUNCT__
or just in case you onli saw michel __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ i want to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
when my oppon said we should __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ we came togeth to reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
in the last 2Â½ year __PUNCT__ we creat more than half a million new manufactur job in thi countri __PUNCT__
so now you have a choic __PUNCT__
we can build on that progress __PUNCT__ or we can do what the other folk want to do and give more tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we can continu to see outsourc __PUNCT__ or we can do some insourc and reward compani that open new plant and train new worker and creat new job right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i want to help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can make that happen __PUNCT__
but i go to need your help __PUNCT__
number two __PUNCT__ i want us to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi we gener from sourc like wind and solar __PUNCT__
thousand of american have job todai build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
you can do what mr __PUNCT__ romnei want to do and revers all that progress __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ or we can build on it __PUNCT__
i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
i don't want them to keep collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better plan where we keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog and farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and our truck __PUNCT__ where we put more construct worker back to work retrofit home and factori so thei wast less energi __PUNCT__
we can develop nearli a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
and my plan would cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and support more than __NUM__ new job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
but i go to need your help to make it happen __PUNCT__
number three __PUNCT__ i want to give more american the chanc to learn the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
governor warner __PUNCT__ senat warner said it well __PUNCT__ we got to invest in our workforc __PUNCT__
and educ wa the gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__ it wa the gatewai of opportun for michel __PUNCT__
it the gatewai of opportun for mani of you __PUNCT__
it the gatewai to a middl class life __PUNCT__
and we alreadi been work on thi __PUNCT__ so million of student ar right now pai less for colleg becaus we took on a system that wa wast billion of dollar in taxpay monei to bank and lender __PUNCT__
we said __PUNCT__ let give it directli to student __PUNCT__
but now you got a choic __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ thei want to gut educ to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
i think that the wrong wai to go __PUNCT__
i think we can decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei didn't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find on with the right skill right here in virginia __PUNCT__
so i ask you to help me recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher in the next __NUM__ year and improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
let give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn skill at a commun colleg for job that ar hire right now __PUNCT__
and let work to __PUNCT__ with colleg and univers to cut the growth of tuition cost __PUNCT__ becaus we don't want our young peopl load up with debt __PUNCT__
we want them to be abl to get the educ thei need to compet in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
that the path we have to choos togeth __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we got to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
and i put forward a plan that independ expert have look at the number __PUNCT__ it cut the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i alreadi work with the republican to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__ and i will to do more __PUNCT__
i want to reform our tax code so it simpler and fairer __PUNCT__ but the onli wai we go to reduc the deficit is also to ask wealthiest household to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ to go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and understand __PUNCT__ the reason why i want to do thi __PUNCT__ it becaus that how an economi grow __PUNCT__
if we keep tax low for middl class famili __PUNCT__ if you got a littl more monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you spend it __PUNCT__
mayb you bui that new comput for your kid __PUNCT__
mayb you final trade in that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car you got __PUNCT__
and that mean that busi now ha more custom __PUNCT__ and thei make more profit __PUNCT__ which mean thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
everybodi doe better when we grow togeth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon __PUNCT__ he got a plan __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
but as presid clinton point out __PUNCT__ there no math in it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it miss arithmet __PUNCT__
thei sai the biggest prioriti __PUNCT__ we got to reduc our debt __PUNCT__ reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
you see their ad __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ we got to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
and then the first thing thei want to do is spend trillion of dollar on new tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
and when you ask them __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how doe that work __PUNCT__ thei can't explain it __PUNCT__
thei won't sai how thei pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
thei want to spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion on new militari spend that our militari sai we don't need __PUNCT__
the reason thei can't explain it is becaus the math doesn't work __PUNCT__
and i tell you what __PUNCT__ i want you to be clear __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ i want to work with republican to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
i don't want continu gridlock on capitol hill __PUNCT__ but i not asham to sai i will refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais kid just so millionair get anoth tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children off of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american __PUNCT__ includ the poor and the elderli and the disabl __PUNCT__ just to pai for more tax cut that we can't afford __PUNCT__
and i promis you __PUNCT__ i will refus to turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
american who have work hard shouldn't have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with the care and the digniti thei have earn __PUNCT__
so we reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
just like we keep the promis of social secur __PUNCT__ but we will not be slash benefit or turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__ like some have propos __PUNCT__
that the wrong wai to go __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ i talk about what we need to do here at home __PUNCT__ but it connect to what we do abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
thirti __PUNCT__ three thousand more troop have now left afghanistan __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ a new tower is rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
but as we saw last week __PUNCT__ we still face seriou threat in the world __PUNCT__
we have to make sure that not onli our militari __PUNCT__ but also our diplomat oversea ar protect __PUNCT__
we got to go after anybodi who harm american oversea __PUNCT__
and as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop come home and take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who have __PUNCT__ who ha fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon ha got a differ idea __PUNCT__
he sai it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ still won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and i us the monei we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and put more folk to work back here in the unit state rebuild road and bridg __PUNCT__ runwai __PUNCT__ broadband line __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__
after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
so that the choic we now face __PUNCT__
thi is what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
over and over __PUNCT__ we been told by the other side __PUNCT__ the oppon __PUNCT__ that bigger tax cut and fewer regul ar the onli wai to go __PUNCT__ that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their basic attitud is __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if some plant is releas pollut into the air that your children breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ just borrow some monei from your parent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i got a differ vision __PUNCT__
i don't think that who we ar __PUNCT__
i don't think that what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
we don't think govern can solv all our problem __PUNCT__
but we don't think govern is the sourc of all our problem either __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we don't think anybodi is the sourc of all our problem __PUNCT__ not welfar recipi __PUNCT__ not corpor __PUNCT__ not union __PUNCT__ not immigr __PUNCT__ not gai __PUNCT__
not all the other group that we told to blame for our troubl __PUNCT__ becaus we believ that here in america we all in it togeth __PUNCT__
we believ america onli work when we accept respons for ourselv __PUNCT__ but also certain respons for each other and for our countri __PUNCT__ to creat a countri that fill with more opportun and possibl than ani other nation on earth __PUNCT__
we understand that america is not what can be done for us __PUNCT__ but what can be done by us togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
and that what the campaign wa about __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
i sai it again __PUNCT__ it wa not about me __PUNCT__
