now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ we had independ and even some republican come togeth __PUNCT__ becaus we want to restor the basic bargain that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that built the greatest middl class and the most prosper economi in the histori of the world __PUNCT__

incom had gone down __PUNCT__ when you account inflat __PUNCT__ even though the cost of everyth from health care to colleg had gone up __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
so we knew restor thi dream __PUNCT__ reinstat thi basic bargain wa not go to be easi __PUNCT__
and we understood it would take more than on year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the middl class got clobber by thi financi crisi __PUNCT__
and a lot of our friend and neighbor lost their job __PUNCT__ lost their home __PUNCT__ lost their save __PUNCT__ and it made that dream seem even further out of reach __PUNCT__
but here the good new __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar tougher than tough time __PUNCT__
not onli is there a fundament good and decenc to the american peopl __PUNCT__ but there also grit and resili __PUNCT__
and when we get knock down __PUNCT__ we get back up __PUNCT__
and so for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we work to make sure that we didn't slip into a great depress __PUNCT__
and we creat 4½ million new job __PUNCT__
we save an auto industri on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__
and although we ar far awai from where we need to be __PUNCT__ at thi point __PUNCT__ there wa a disturb in the audienc __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

and keep in mind __PUNCT__ thi would not be to pai down our deficit __PUNCT__
it wouldn't be to grow job or invest in educ or make colleg more afford or invest in scienc and research or clean energi __PUNCT__ becaus he want to gut all those thing __PUNCT__
he want to cut awai that stuff __PUNCT__
your tax increas would be to pai for anoth __MONEY__ tax cut for peopl make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ it didn't work __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to cut the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for folk like me __PUNCT__
we need tax relief for work famili __PUNCT__
we need tax cut for folk who ar try to make sure their kid get a good educ __PUNCT__ try to keep their kid healthi __PUNCT__ try to keep a roof over their head __PUNCT__ try to send them to colleg __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ becaus our work is not yet done __PUNCT__
i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__
i did that __PUNCT__
the averag __PUNCT__ typic famili __PUNCT__ their incom tax __PUNCT__ their tax burden is about __MONEY__ lower than it is now __PUNCT__
i want to keep tax exactli where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
i alreadi told congress __PUNCT__ let get it done __PUNCT__
we should do it befor the elect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ is __NUM__ percent of american famili and __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__ under my plan __PUNCT__ your incom tax would not increas a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
that my plan __PUNCT__
but if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ if thi countri ha bless you the wai it bless me __PUNCT__ you still get a tax cut on the first __MONEY__ of incom __PUNCT__
it just that after that __PUNCT__ we go to ask you to contribut a littl bit more so we can pai down our deficit respons and invest in thing like help young peopl go to colleg __PUNCT__ invest in basic scienc and research __PUNCT__ rebuild our road __PUNCT__ all the thing that help us grow and make the middl class strong __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ thi doesn't mean that we don't still have more work to do to make govern more effici __PUNCT__
i not somebodi who believ govern can solv everi problem __PUNCT__
govern ha to do it part by cut out spend that we don't need __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ a trillion __PUNCT__ that with a __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ out of our budget __PUNCT__
and we can do more to make govern more effici __PUNCT__ more custom friendli __PUNCT__
but that doesn't do enough to bring down the deficit __PUNCT__
so all i ask is that folk like me go back to the rate that we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ you mai rememb __PUNCT__ we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole bunch of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
becaus what happen is __PUNCT__ when a construct worker or a polic offic __PUNCT__ thei got a littl more monei to spend __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ mayb thei go out and bui that new car __PUNCT__
and suddenli __PUNCT__ the car compani ha more profit __PUNCT__ which mean that hire more worker __PUNCT__ and everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
when a teacher or a receptionist ha a littl bit more monei to spend __PUNCT__ mayb thei go to that local restaur __PUNCT__
mayb thei bui a comput for their kid for school __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ suddenli __PUNCT__ all busi ar do better __PUNCT__
that the histori of america __PUNCT__
when we grow from the middl class out __PUNCT__ when we provid ladder of opportun for those who want to get into the middl class and ar will to work hard to do it __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__ top __PUNCT__ middl __PUNCT__ bottom __PUNCT__
we ar in thi thing togeth __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thi differ in vision __PUNCT__ it show up on all sort of issu __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million job at stake __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei said __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ let bet on america worker __PUNCT__
and we got manag and worker to come togeth __PUNCT__ make better car than ever __PUNCT__
and now gm is number on again __PUNCT__ and the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so now i want to sai what we did with the auto industri __PUNCT__ we can do it in manufactur across america __PUNCT__
let make sure advanc __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur job take root here __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__
let have them here in colorado __PUNCT__
and that mean support invest here __PUNCT__
governor romnei talk about hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__
but he invest in compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
i don't want to outsourc __PUNCT__ i want to insourc __PUNCT__
let reform our tax code __PUNCT__ and let make it simpler __PUNCT__
and let make sure that we provid tax break to compani that ar invest here in colorado spring __PUNCT__ here in colorado __PUNCT__ not oversea __PUNCT__
thei the on who need tax break __PUNCT__
let give tax break to compani that ar invest here __PUNCT__
it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
at a moment when homegrown energi is creat new job in state like colorado and iowa __PUNCT__ my oppon want to end tax credit for wind produc __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the wind industri support about __NUM__ job across thi technologiesst __PUNCT__
without those tax credit __PUNCT__ job would be at risk __PUNCT__ __NUM__ job across thi countri would be at risk __PUNCT__
why would we want to stop promot clean __PUNCT__ renew energi that can make our environ better __PUNCT__ put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ free our depend from foreign oil __PUNCT__ we should stop spend billion of taxpay subsidi on the oil industri that is veri profit __PUNCT__
let keep invest in a clean energi industri that never been more promis __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
here anoth choic __PUNCT__
i promis in __NUM__ i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
we end it __PUNCT__
i said we go after bin laden and al qaida __PUNCT__
we did __PUNCT__
we transit in afghanistan and start to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
and so none of thi could have been accomplish had it not been for our outstand men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
we ar safer and more respect becaus of them __PUNCT__
but now we got to make sure that the countri thei come back to is go on all cylind __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ let set up a veteran job corp that help return veteran get job as firefight and polic offic in commun that need them __PUNCT__
let make sure that thei ar get the train that thei need __PUNCT__

and i want to make colleg and univers tuition lower so young peopl aren't burden with ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ worth of debt __PUNCT__
we can do it __PUNCT__
becaus higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it an econom necess in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
my oppon doesn't have a plan for higher educ __PUNCT__
he doesn't have a plan for homeownership __PUNCT__
he wa ask __PUNCT__ what should we do about the hous crisi __PUNCT__
