and as i point out last night __PUNCT__ and you gui heard yourselv __PUNCT__ it realli a on __PUNCT__ point plan __PUNCT__
it realli a on __PUNCT__ point plan __PUNCT__
it sai folk at the veri top can plai by their own set of rule __PUNCT__
that why thei can pai lower tax than you do or thei can us offshor account __PUNCT__
or thei can invest in a compani __PUNCT__ bankrupt it __PUNCT__ fire the worker __PUNCT__ take awai their pension __PUNCT__ ship the job oversea __PUNCT__ and still make monei do it __PUNCT__
it the on __PUNCT__ point plan that sai it okai for wall street to keep engag in the reckless behavior that got us into the mess we been fight back from for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
it the same philosophi that been squeez middl class famili for more than a decad __PUNCT__
it the same philosophi that we saw in the previou administr __PUNCT__
and i have seen too much pain and too much struggl to let thi countri go down that same road again __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__ we can't __PUNCT__ i want you to know __PUNCT__ folk here in iowa understand thi __PUNCT__ you cannot grow thi economi from the top down __PUNCT__
you grow thi economi from the middl class out __PUNCT__
we not go to go back to what we were do befor __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__

but when folk start crunch the number __PUNCT__ it fell apart even faster than hi tax plan __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ turn out hi job math isn't ani better than hi tax math __PUNCT__
the washington post call it a __PUNCT__ bait and switch __PUNCT__

we made sure insur compani have to let parent keep their children on their parent __PUNCT__ plan until thei __NUM__ year old if thei don't have health insur __PUNCT__
we said to insur compani __PUNCT__ you got to charg women the same as men becaus be a woman is not a preexist condit __PUNCT__
we repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ so no on is ever kick out of the militari becaus of who thei love __PUNCT__
when governor romnei said we should just let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ we said thank but no thank __PUNCT__ and we reinvent a dy auto industri that come roar back to the top of the world __PUNCT__
last time i wa here __PUNCT__ i said to student __PUNCT__ we go to help you make sure you can afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__ and we took __MONEY__ billion that wa go to bank and middlemen in the student loan program __PUNCT__ we said let cut out the middleman __PUNCT__ let give that monei directli to student __PUNCT__
and as a consequ __PUNCT__ million of student have benefit from lower interest rate and pell grant __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year after the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ we move forward again __PUNCT__
after lose __NUM__ job a month when i took offic __PUNCT__ our busi have now ad more than __NUM__ million new job over the past 2Â½ year __PUNCT__

our assembl line ar start to hum again __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ we got a lot more work to do __PUNCT__ but we got to build on that progress __PUNCT__
and i got a plan to grow the economi and creat job and build more secur for middl class famili __PUNCT__
i talk about it last night __PUNCT__
i want to export more product __PUNCT__ outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
we can keep give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can give those tax break to compani that ar invest right here in iowa __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ rebuild our manufactur base __PUNCT__
i want to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
you heard last night __PUNCT__ oil product is up __PUNCT__
natur ga product is up __PUNCT__
but what we also said is we got to develop new sourc of energi __PUNCT__ and we got to be more effici with our economi __PUNCT__
and so we rais fuel __PUNCT__ effici standard on car so by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
we have doubl the amount of renew energi that we gener from wind and solar and biofuel __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
and so the question __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__
so the choic you have __PUNCT__ you heard last night __PUNCT__ it not a choic between oil versu solar or natur ga versu wind __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ we all agre we got to increas oil product __PUNCT__
we all agre we got to increas natur ga product __PUNCT__
but the question is whether we build on the progress for the new energi sourc of the futur __PUNCT__
i not go to keep on give corpor __PUNCT__ taxpay __PUNCT__ fund welfar to oil compani __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__ when we could be us that monei to continu to promot wind and solar and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__ and put american back to work right now __PUNCT__ see that technolog develop here in the unit state instead of china or germani or some other countri __PUNCT__
and i got to tell you __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__ thi is not a pipedream __PUNCT__ there ar nearli __NUM__ job in iowa right now depend on wind energi __PUNCT__
last night governor romnei claim he didn't have a plan to end wind job in iowa __PUNCT__ but he call these job __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
hi plan would end tax credit for wind energi produc __PUNCT__
that is a fact __PUNCT__
my plan will keep these invest __PUNCT__ and we keep reduc the carbon pollut that also heat the planet __PUNCT__ becaus climat chang isn't a hoax __PUNCT__
the drought we seen __PUNCT__ the flood __PUNCT__ the wildfir __PUNCT__ those aren't a joke __PUNCT__
thei a threat to our children futur __PUNCT__
and we can do someth about it __PUNCT__
that part of what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want to give more american the chanc to get a great educ and get the skill thei need to compet in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
i tri to talk about educ last night __PUNCT__
we kept on get waylaid __PUNCT__
but if you talk about job and econom growth __PUNCT__ what more import than make sure everybodi ha got the skill thei need __PUNCT__ i onli here becaus of a great educ __PUNCT__
all the young peopl who ar make an invest in their colleg educ right now __PUNCT__ you gui understand you got to be equip __PUNCT__
michel __PUNCT__ her gatewai into the middl __PUNCT__ into opportun wa her educ system __PUNCT__
her dad wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__ her mom wa a secretari __PUNCT__
and right now __PUNCT__ as i said __PUNCT__ becaus of the action we alreadi took __PUNCT__ million of young peopl ar pai less for colleg becaus we final took on that system that wa wast taxpay dollar __PUNCT__ gave it directli to student __PUNCT__
rachel __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ i took a photo with her parent backstag __PUNCT__ and she talk about how __PUNCT__ the fact that we put in place a tax credit for middl incom famili to send their kid to colleg is help her attend school right now __PUNCT__
but what you saw last night __PUNCT__ even though we weren't abl to talk about it as much as i would have like __PUNCT__ is a fundament differ __PUNCT__
governor romnei sai hire more teacher won't grow our economi over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ it will __PUNCT__
but more importantli __PUNCT__ what about our kid over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ what about our economi for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we could gut educ __PUNCT__ pai for governor romnei __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ or we can recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher over the next decad __PUNCT__ help our young peopl refocu on scienc and technolog __PUNCT__ engin __PUNCT__ math __PUNCT__
we should make sure all our young peopl __PUNCT__ our daughter as well as our son __PUNCT__ ar thrive in these field __PUNCT__
thi should be a nation mission __PUNCT__
i got to tell you __PUNCT__ we don't have to collect a bunch of binder to find qualifi __PUNCT__ talent __PUNCT__ driven young women readi to learn and teach in these field right now __PUNCT__
and when young women graduat __PUNCT__ thei should get equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
that should be a simpl question to answer __PUNCT__
when governor romnei wa ask about it __PUNCT__ hi campaign said __PUNCT__ we get back to you __PUNCT__
that shouldn't be a complic question __PUNCT__ equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
i want my daughter paid just like somebodi els son ar paid for the same job __PUNCT__
that straightforward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to sai __PUNCT__ last night governor romnei top advisor final admit __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ the governor didn't realli support that bill __PUNCT__
you don't have to wait for an answer from me __PUNCT__
the lilli ledbett fair pai act wa the first bill i sign into law as presid __PUNCT__ the first bill __PUNCT__
governor romnei didn't want to talk much last night about how he want to end fund for plan parenthood __PUNCT__ how he support legisl that would turn certain decis about a woman health care over to their employ __PUNCT__
he didn't want to talk about it becaus he know he can't sell it __PUNCT__
i don't think your boss should control the health care you get __PUNCT__
i don't think insur should control the health care you get __PUNCT__
i certainli don't think politician should control the health care that you get __PUNCT__
we pass obamacar __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i like the term __PUNCT__ we pass it __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ becaus i do care __PUNCT__ and i want to put these choic in your hand where thei belong __PUNCT__
fourth plan __PUNCT__ fourth part of the plan to creat job right here is us some of the monei we save from end those war in iraq __PUNCT__ wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ to pai down our deficit __PUNCT__ put our peopl back to work __PUNCT__ includ our veteran __PUNCT__ rebuild road and bridg and school all across america __PUNCT__
governor romnei and i just have a differ theori on thi __PUNCT__
he said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ the wai we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ doubl down on the belief in a speech just last week __PUNCT__ said we should have kept troop on the ground in iraq __PUNCT__
i disagre __PUNCT__
i know these troop __PUNCT__
i know their famili __PUNCT__
i know how dedic thei ar and the sacrific thei and their famili make __PUNCT__
and it wa time to bring those troop home to their famili __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and everi brave american who wear the uniform of thi countri __PUNCT__ thei need to know __PUNCT__ as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we go to maintain the strongest militari in the world __PUNCT__
and when those troop take off the uniform __PUNCT__ we go to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi should have to fight for a job after thei fought for our countri __PUNCT__
nobodi should have to fight for a roof over their head or the health care thei need after thei fought for america __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i want to cut the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and i work with republican and democrat alreadi to cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__
i readi to cut more spend that is not contribut to our growth __PUNCT__
but we can't just cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
we got to make invest in scienc and research and infrastructur __PUNCT__
and we can't do all that and reduc our deficit unless we ask the wealthiest household to pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__
so keep in mind __PUNCT__ somebodi make __MONEY__ thei still keep the tax break for the first __NUM__ but after that __PUNCT__ let go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ our economi creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__
governor romnei wa ask __PUNCT__ is it fair that he pai a lower tax rate than a teacher who make __MONEY__
he said __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i think it fair __PUNCT__ i think that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
he wrong __PUNCT__
there the __PUNCT__ you look at our econom histori __PUNCT__ that not how we grew an economi __PUNCT__ by just have a few folk at the top pai even less than folk in the middl __PUNCT__
i not go to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home __PUNCT__ or rais their kid __PUNCT__ or send their kid to colleg just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to ask the student here to pai more for colleg so i have a littl more monei in my pocket __PUNCT__
i don't need it __PUNCT__
i not go to kick children out of head start program __PUNCT__ or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor __PUNCT__ or elderli __PUNCT__ or disabl __PUNCT__
and governor romnei again last night __PUNCT__ over and over again __PUNCT__ he sai __PUNCT__ i can cut tax for everybodi __PUNCT__ i can increas militari spend by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ i will lower tax for middl class famili and i go to close the deficit __PUNCT__
he keep on sai it __PUNCT__
and when peopl ask __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what ar you go to cut __PUNCT__ becaus i don't know about you gui __PUNCT__ but if i look at my budget and i try to shrink my debt __PUNCT__ i got to cut someth out __PUNCT__
so so far __PUNCT__ what he offer is elimin fund for plan parenthood and get rid of big bird __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and end wind tax credit __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it add up to less than 1/100th of __NUM__ percent of the feder budget __PUNCT__
so he claim hi __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ that wa an estim __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__
i wa do that off the top of my head __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he claim hi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut will creat million of new job and pai for themselv __PUNCT__
we have heard thi pitch befor __PUNCT__
you know where we heard it __PUNCT__ in the previou administr __PUNCT__
we know it doesn't work __PUNCT__
we know what we talk about doe creat job __PUNCT__
and now the choic is up to you __PUNCT__
the elect now is up to you __PUNCT__
it come down to thi __PUNCT__
over and over again __PUNCT__ our oppon tell us that becaus govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
if a compani releas harm pollut into the air __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what america is about __PUNCT__
we ar in thi thing togeth __PUNCT__
that what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ that we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__
we understand __PUNCT__ america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ but what can be done by us __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__
iowa __PUNCT__ you the reason that we got shutter factori in place like newton that ar now hum again with worker manufactur compon for amaz wind turbin __PUNCT__
you made that happen becaus you believ we could do thi togeth __PUNCT__
you the reason a mother in cedar rapid __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ a mother right here in thi audienc __PUNCT__ doesn't have to worri about surgeri for her daughter becaus the insur compani can't limit her coverag __PUNCT__
you the reason a student in am or iowa citi or cornel colleg can get help pai for a colleg educ and we got a new gi bill for our return veteran to get the educ thei need __PUNCT__
that all happen becaus of you __PUNCT__
and we got to do it again __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr is not go to be sent awai from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason that we were abl to bring our troop home and those famili ar reunit with their love on __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
so if we don't fight as hard as we can over the next __NUM__ week __PUNCT__ all that could be set asid __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
you cannot turn awai __PUNCT__
and if your voic aren't heard __PUNCT__ then the lobbyist and the special interest __PUNCT__ thei fill the void __PUNCT__ the folk who ar write the __MONEY__ million check to try to bui thi elect __PUNCT__ the folk who ar try to make it harder for peopl to vote in thi elect __PUNCT__
and you can't let that happen __PUNCT__
i not go to let that happen __PUNCT__
we work too hard togeth over the last __NUM__ year to let that happen __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ it start here in iowa __PUNCT__
you the on who first show america that chang wa possibl __PUNCT__
and everyth we fought for is now at stake __PUNCT__
and we can choos to go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down polici that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__ or you can choos to move us forward with the polici that have been get us out of thi mess __PUNCT__
you can choos to go back to a foreign polici that get us into war with no plan for get out __PUNCT__ or you can help move us forward and end the afghan war respons and bring our troop home and focu on the terrorist who were go to attack us __PUNCT__
you can choos to turn back the clock __NUM__ year for women and for immigr and for gai and for lesbian __PUNCT__ or you can stand up and sai __PUNCT__ we want to move forward __PUNCT__
we believ in the countri where no matter who you ar or what you look like or where you come from or who you love __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what i still believ in __PUNCT__
and if that what you still believ in __PUNCT__ then we got to fight as hard as we can for the next __NUM__ week __PUNCT__
and i promis you __PUNCT__ if you ar will to stand with me and knock on door with me and work as hard as you can __PUNCT__ and talk to your friend and your neighbor and your classmat __PUNCT__ and if you will vote for me __PUNCT__ we will win linn counti again __PUNCT__
