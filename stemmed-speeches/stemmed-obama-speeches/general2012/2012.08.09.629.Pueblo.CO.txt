__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but listen __PUNCT__ unless you been abl to hide from your tv set or your cabl is broke __PUNCT__ you probabl awar right now that we got a pretti intens campaign go on __PUNCT__
and the reason it so intens is becaus the choic that we face thi __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
more than ani elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ path for our countri __PUNCT__ two fundament differ vision of where thi countri need to go __PUNCT__
and the direct that we choos __PUNCT__ the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ it won't make a differ just in our live __PUNCT__ it will make a differ in our kid __PUNCT__ live and our grandkid __PUNCT__ live for decad to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ rememb that __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ as democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and republican __PUNCT__ to restor the basic bargain that built the greatest middl class and the most prosper economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and it a bargain that sai __PUNCT__ it veri simpl __PUNCT__ it sai __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ hard work should be reward __PUNCT__
it an idea that sai if you put in the effort __PUNCT__ if you take respons for yourself and your commun __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you should be abl to afford a home that you can call your own __PUNCT__
you should be abl to count on health care if you get sick __PUNCT__
you should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most importantli __PUNCT__ you should be abl to give your kid the kind of educ and opportun that let them dream even bigger than you dream and do even better than you did __PUNCT__
that idea is at the heart of america __PUNCT__
that the american promis __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we understood that restor that promis wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__
it would take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ we had been come off a decad in which the middl class had been get hammer __PUNCT__ job had been get ship oversea __PUNCT__ wage and incom were go down __PUNCT__ the cost of everyth from health care to groceri wa go up __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ a crisi that rob too mani of our friend and neighbor of their job and their home and their save and put the american dream even further out of reach __PUNCT__
so we knew that we had a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
and over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we have focus on right the ship __PUNCT__ make sure that we didn't slip into a depress __PUNCT__ save an auto industri __PUNCT__ creat 4½ million new job __PUNCT__ half a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__ get health care done __PUNCT__ help young peopl go to colleg __PUNCT__
we have been work to get us move forward __PUNCT__
to get move forward __PUNCT__
and as tough as thing have been __PUNCT__ and we know our job is not done yet __PUNCT__ what we learn over these last 3½ year is that the crisi didn't chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang our charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what ha made us great __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang why we came togeth __PUNCT__ what we believ in __PUNCT__ why we feel such an urgenc to get to work __PUNCT__
becaus we understand that we need to build an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ so that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ what you look like __PUNCT__ where you come from __PUNCT__ what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ there ar no quick fix __PUNCT__
there ar no easi solut to the challeng we face __PUNCT__
but i know in my bone that we have the capac to meet those challeng __PUNCT__
think about what we got go for us __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best busi peopl in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best research __PUNCT__ the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__
we ar a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got a divers of talent and ingenu that come from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so when you hear peopl sai __PUNCT__ america is in declin or you hear folk for polit reason try to paint thing as dark as thei can __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ there isn't a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
what is stand in our wai right now isn't the lack of technic solut or good plan __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai is the polit in washington __PUNCT__ folk who think compromis is a dirti word __PUNCT__ folk who think the onli thing we can do to grow the economi is to go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and i promis you __PUNCT__ that their onli idea __PUNCT__ to go back to the thing that didn't work __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ hi friend in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ __PUNCT__ thei got two idea __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
two __PUNCT__ thei want to get rid of regul that help keep our air and water clean __PUNCT__ regul that protect our consum __PUNCT__ regul that make sure that wall street doesn't do the same kind of thing that creat the financi crisi __PUNCT__
and their idea is __PUNCT__ is that if we give these big tax cut to folk who don't need them and ar do realli well and we let corpor run roughshod __PUNCT__ even if thei not do the right thing __PUNCT__ that somehow that go to lead to job and prosper for everybodi __PUNCT__
that what thei propos __PUNCT__
that what thei will do if thei win thi elect __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ crystal mention thi __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of mr __PUNCT__ romnei entir econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it is go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
but last week __PUNCT__ we found out he expect the middl class to pick up the tab to pai for it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so you got a __MONEY__ trillion tax plan and to pai for it you rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__ not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ not to grow job __PUNCT__ not to invest in educ __PUNCT__ but just to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to peopl make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ thei have tri to sell us thi trickl __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ tax cut fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
it did not work __PUNCT__
it did not work then __PUNCT__
it is not go to work now __PUNCT__
it is not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it is not a plan to cut the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
we do not need __PUNCT__ i do not need a tax cut __PUNCT__
we don't need tax cut for folk who ar do realli __PUNCT__ realli __PUNCT__ realli well __PUNCT__
we need to keep tax low for work american like you __PUNCT__
we need to keep tax cut in place for famili who ar try to rais kid and keep them healthi and send them to colleg and keep a roof over their head __PUNCT__
and that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis that i would cut middl class tax __PUNCT__
i kept that promis __PUNCT__
and the averag middl class famili __PUNCT__ their tax ar about __MONEY__ lower than when i came into offic __PUNCT__
so if you talk to your friend and thei sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ he some big tax democrat __PUNCT__ you tell them __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ he cut your tax __PUNCT__
now i want to keep tax exactli where thei ar on the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if you a famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ which is __NUM__ percent of american famili __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax go up by on singl dime __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ if you make more than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you still get a tax cut on your first __MONEY__
but if you make __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__ then we go to go take the rest of it and tax that a littl bit more at the rate we tax it under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and listen __PUNCT__ the reason we do that is not becaus we love tax __PUNCT__
i would end up have to pai more under my plan __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ and it not like i love pai tax __PUNCT__ but i understand that i got to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
i been so bless __PUNCT__
and it will help us bring down our deficit and invest in thing like educ that will help us grow as an economi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ understand also __PUNCT__ we go to make sure that govern doe it part __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar of spend that we didn't need __PUNCT__ and we keep streamlin govern to make it more effect __PUNCT__
but we just ask folk like me to go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ and that wa a time when the economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__
and it actual wa good for busi and good for folk at the top too __PUNCT__
becaus you know what happen __PUNCT__ if a steelwork or a construct worker __PUNCT__ thei got a job and thei got a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ mayb thei bui that new car __PUNCT__
and that mean that now that busi ha more profit __PUNCT__ mayb thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
if a teacher or a receptionist ha a littl bit more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ mayb thei go over to anoth restaur __PUNCT__
mayb thei go to romero __PUNCT__ and thei eat out __PUNCT__
and now the restaur hire a coupl more worker __PUNCT__
everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
that how the economi grow best __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__
when all of us share in prosper __PUNCT__ we all do better __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__ becaus i believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we got a bunch of exampl of the differ __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ million job at stake __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i said i believ in american worker __PUNCT__ i believ in thi american industri __PUNCT__ and now the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__ and gm is number on again __PUNCT__
so now i want to do the same thing with manufactur job not just in the auto industri __PUNCT__ but in everi industri __PUNCT__
i don't want those job take root in place like china __PUNCT__ i want them take root in place like pueblo __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ governor romnei brag about hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__ but it wa mostli invest in compani __PUNCT__ some of which were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
i don't want to be a pioneer of outsourc __PUNCT__ i want to insourc __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ let give those tax break to compani that ar invest here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ make american product with american worker and sell them around the world __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
here anoth differ __PUNCT__
at a moment when homegrown energi __PUNCT__ renew energi is creat new job in state like colorado and iowa __PUNCT__ my oppon want to end tax credit for wind energi produc __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

the wind industri support about __NUM__ job across thi state __PUNCT__
without those tax credit __PUNCT__ __NUM__ american job __PUNCT__ includ potenti hundr of job right here __PUNCT__ would be at risk __PUNCT__
colorado __PUNCT__ it time to stop spend billion in taxpay subsidi on an oil industri that alreadi make a lot of profit __PUNCT__
and let keep invest in new energi sourc that have never been more promis __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
i run becaus in __NUM__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i end it __PUNCT__
i promis to go after al qaida and go after bin laden __PUNCT__ and we did it __PUNCT__
we set a timelin to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ to make afghan respons for their own secur __PUNCT__
and we could not have done all thi if it had not been for our outstand men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
here in pueblo __PUNCT__ the home of hero __PUNCT__ you know what it mean to care for our veteran __PUNCT__
i want to thank you for everyth you done and ar do to look after our men and women who have worn the uniform __PUNCT__
and i promis you that as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ thi countri will care for our veteran and serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi who ha fought for our countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
so my plan will creat a veteran job corp __PUNCT__ so we can put return hero back to work as cop and firefight in commun that need them __PUNCT__
and i want to take about half the monei that we no longer spend on war __PUNCT__ and let put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
let renew our road and our runwai and our wireless network __PUNCT__

i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to studi at commun colleg and get the skill thei need for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
i want to get colleg and univers to bring tuition down onc and for all __PUNCT__
becaus in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it an econom necess __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure none of our young peopl who ar will to put in the effort ar lock out of opportun __PUNCT__
so the stake ar big in thi elect on everi issu __PUNCT__
on homeownership __PUNCT__ my oppon sai __PUNCT__ let just let foreclosur bottom out __PUNCT__

women can make their own decis __PUNCT__
we don't need politician do it __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei think __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ wa a good idea __PUNCT__
i think anybodi who love thi countri should be abl to serv thi countri __PUNCT__
that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei believ in someth call self __PUNCT__ deport __PUNCT__ think arizona is a model for immigr law across the countri __PUNCT__

that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we go forward __PUNCT__ not backward __PUNCT__
on everi singl on of these issu __PUNCT__ there is a choic __PUNCT__
and it about whether we go back to the fail polici of the past or whether we actual final start onc again work around that core idea that built thi countri __PUNCT__ the idea that if you work hard here you can make it __PUNCT__
the idea that in america __PUNCT__ everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
the idea that in america we rise or fall togeth and govern can't solv everi problem and it shouldn't try and it certainli can't help folk who ar aren't will to help themselv __PUNCT__
but there ar some thing that we can do togeth as a peopl that make us all better off __PUNCT__ that make our countri strong __PUNCT__ and that our economi work best when the middl class is grow and feel secur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ we got less than __NUM__ month left in thi elect __PUNCT__ less than __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
