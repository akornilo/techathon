now __PUNCT__ unless you manag to complet avoid your televis set __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ or your cabl is broken __PUNCT__ you ar awar that there is a pretti intens campaign go on right now __PUNCT__
and the reason it intens is becaus the choic that we face in __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__
it not even just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
more than ani elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ path for our countri futur __PUNCT__
and the direct that you choos __PUNCT__ the direct you choos when you walk into that vote booth __NUM__ month from now __PUNCT__ will have a direct impact not just on your live __PUNCT__ but on the live of your children and the live of your grandchildren __PUNCT__
and that true for everybodi __PUNCT__
but it especi true for the women in thi countri __PUNCT__ from work mom to colleg student __PUNCT__ to senior __PUNCT__
becaus when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ it bad enough that our oppon want to take us back to the same polici of the last decad __PUNCT__ the same polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__ the same polici that saw job go oversea and end up see peopl wage and incom go down even as the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__ polici that culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress and that we spent __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ 3½ year try to recov from __PUNCT__
that bad enough __PUNCT__
but when it come to a woman right to make her own health care choic __PUNCT__ thei want to take us back to the polici more suit to the 1950 than the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ you got to make sure it doe not happen __PUNCT__
the decis that affect a woman health __PUNCT__ thei not up to politician __PUNCT__ thei not up to insur compani __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei up to you __PUNCT__
and you deserv a presid who will fight to keep it that wai __PUNCT__
that the presid i been __PUNCT__
that the presid i will be if i get a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ to keep move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
on the issu that matter __PUNCT__ you don't have to take my word for it __PUNCT__ you can take me at my record __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i deliv on my promis to pass health reform befor the end of my first term __PUNCT__
that what we did __PUNCT__
the afford health __PUNCT__ the afford care act __PUNCT__ also known as obamacar __PUNCT__ i actual like the name __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ becaus i do care __PUNCT__
that why we fought so hard to make it happen __PUNCT__
the afford care act help make sure you don't have to worri about go broke just becaus on of your love on get sick __PUNCT__
insur compani can no longer place lifetim limit on your care __PUNCT__
thei can no longer jack up your premium without reason __PUNCT__
thei can no longer drop your coverag when you need it most __PUNCT__
thei can no longer discrimin against children with preexist condit __PUNCT__
and pretti soon __PUNCT__ thei no longer be abl to deni you coverag base on a preexist condit __PUNCT__ like breast cancer or cervic cancer __PUNCT__ or charg you more for care just becaus you a woman __PUNCT__
thei can't do that anymor __PUNCT__
those dai ar over __PUNCT__
thi is a law that allow young adult under the ag of __NUM__ to stai on their parent __PUNCT__ health care plan __PUNCT__ and that alreadi help __NUM__ million young american __PUNCT__
if you a littl bit over __NUM__ it give senior a discount on their prescript drug __PUNCT__ a discount that alreadi save million of senior on medicar hundr of dollar each __PUNCT__
right now nearli __NUM__ million american ar get a rebat from insur compani __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__ thei send you a check __PUNCT__ becaus under the law __PUNCT__ we cap the amount of monei that thei can spend on administr cost and ceo bonus instead of your health care __PUNCT__
and when thei violat that rule __PUNCT__ thei got to send you a check __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ obamacar secur new access to prevent care like mammogram and cancer screen __PUNCT__ with no co __PUNCT__ pai __PUNCT__ no deduct __PUNCT__ no out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ pocket cost __PUNCT__ for more than __NUM__ million women __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ insur compani began cover even more servic __PUNCT__
and now most health plan ar go to begin cover the cost of contracept care __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ understand thi is crucial for women health __PUNCT__
doctor prescrib contracept not just for famili plan __PUNCT__ but as a wai to reduc the risk of ovarian and other cancer __PUNCT__
and it good for our health care system in gener __PUNCT__ becaus we know the overal cost of care is lower when women have access to contracept servic __PUNCT__
and listen __PUNCT__ we recogn that mani peopl have strongli held religi view on contracept __PUNCT__ which is why we made sure church and other hous of worship __PUNCT__ thei don't have to provid it __PUNCT__ thei don't have to pai for it __PUNCT__
we work with the cathol hospit and univers to find a solut that protect both religi liberti and a woman health __PUNCT__
so the fact is nearli __NUM__ percent of women have reli on contracept at some point __PUNCT__ and more than half of all women between the ag of __NUM__ and __NUM__ have struggl to afford it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and we chang that __PUNCT__
befor health care reform __PUNCT__ mani health care plan charg high deduct or co __PUNCT__ pai for all these prevent servic __PUNCT__ or thei just didn't cover them at all __PUNCT__
and accord to on studi __PUNCT__ more than half of all women put off the care thei need becaus of that __PUNCT__
how mani of you have gone without care that you need or a checkup becaus you knew that you might not be abl to afford the insur co __PUNCT__ pai __PUNCT__ and you had to choos between ga or groceri or your kid new soccer uniform __PUNCT__
i don't think a work mom in denver should have to wait to get a mammogram just becaus monei is tight __PUNCT__
i don't think a colleg student in colorado spring should have to choos between textbook or the prevent care that she need __PUNCT__
that why we pass thi law __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon ha a differ view __PUNCT__
as sandra said __PUNCT__ he said he would take the afford care act and __PUNCT__ kill it dead __PUNCT__ on the first dai of hi presid __PUNCT__ kill it dead __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
which __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ just understand what thi mean __PUNCT__
thi mean __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million young peopl don't have health insur __PUNCT__
the prevent care gone __PUNCT__
senior pai more for prescript drug __PUNCT__
preexist condit __PUNCT__ you out of luck __PUNCT__
then he said he __PUNCT__ get rid of __PUNCT__ plan parenthood __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
then he said he would have support an extrem measur in mississippi that could have outlaw some form of contracept __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
then he join the far right of hi parti to support a bill that would allow ani employ to deni contracept coverag to their employe __PUNCT__
so it would be up to the employ to decid __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ your boss tell you what best for your health and your safeti __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ denver __PUNCT__ i don't think your boss should get to control the health care that you get __PUNCT__
i don't think insur compani should control the care that you get __PUNCT__
i don't think politician should control the care that you get __PUNCT__
i think there on person to make these decis on health care __PUNCT__ and that is you __PUNCT__
you should make that decis __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei is run as the candid of conserv valu __PUNCT__
there noth conserv about a govern that prevent a woman from make her own health care decis __PUNCT__
he sai he the candid of freedom __PUNCT__
but freedom is the chanc __PUNCT__ the opportun to determin for yourself the care that you need __PUNCT__ when you need it __PUNCT__
it the abil to chang job or start your own busi without fear of lose your health insur __PUNCT__
we not go back to the dai when it wa accept to charg women more than men for health care __PUNCT__
and we not go back to the dai when women with preexist condit __PUNCT__ like be a cancer survivor __PUNCT__ were deni afford care __PUNCT__
we not go to kick more than a million young women off their parent plan __PUNCT__
we ar not go backward __PUNCT__ denver __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid again __PUNCT__
and understand thi __PUNCT__ at a time when women make up nearli half the workforc __PUNCT__ an increas share of famili breadwinn __PUNCT__ these aren't just health issu __PUNCT__ and thei not just women issu __PUNCT__
these ar econom issu __PUNCT__
thei affect everi famili in america __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__
think about what it mean when a woman is the main breadwinn for her famili __PUNCT__ but she take less pai home __PUNCT__ do the same work as a man __PUNCT__ just becaus she a woman __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
when my oppon campaign wa ask if he fight to guarante an equal dai pai for an equal dai work __PUNCT__ you know what the campaign said __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ we get back to you on that __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that not a good answer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we get back to you on that __PUNCT__ he won't sai what he do about it __PUNCT__
you got my answer __PUNCT__ uphold the principl of equal pai for equal work wa the first bill i sign into law __PUNCT__
the lilli ledbett act __PUNCT__ first bill i sign __PUNCT__
and on other thing __PUNCT__
todai is the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year anniversari of sonia sotomayor take her seat on the suprem court __PUNCT__
yesterdai wa the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year anniversari of elena kagan take her seat on the suprem court __PUNCT__
so let be veri clear __PUNCT__ the next presid could tip the balanc of the court in a wai that turn back the clock for women and famili for decad to come __PUNCT__
the choic between go backward and move forward ha never been so clear __PUNCT__
and let me sai thi __PUNCT__
when i talk about women issu __PUNCT__ i talk about the experi that i seen in my own life __PUNCT__
everybodi know michel __PUNCT__
the fact that we ar partner in thi process __PUNCT__ thi journei of life __PUNCT__ ha been my sourc of strength __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that she ha control over her health care choic __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that when she work __PUNCT__ she is get paid the same as men __PUNCT__
i got to sai __PUNCT__ first ladi right now don't __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ even though that a tough job __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ my own mom would have been __NUM__ year old thi year __PUNCT__
and my sister and i lost her to cancer when she wa just __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
and she got to meet michel __PUNCT__ but she never got a chanc to meet her granddaught or watch them grow up __PUNCT__
and i often think about what might have happen if a doctor had caught her cancer sooner __PUNCT__ or if she had been abl to spend less time focus on how she wa go to pai her bill and more time on get well __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
she is still with us __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
she is still with us __PUNCT__

i think about malia and sasha __PUNCT__ and i think to myself __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we not go to have an america where thei have fewer opportun than somebodi son __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i don't want them have fewer choic than anybodi boi do __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ as i had the privileg to travel all across thi countri and meet american from all walk of life __PUNCT__ i heard so mani stori like mine __PUNCT__
and i decid nobodi els should have to endur the heartbreak of a broken health care system __PUNCT__
no on in the wealthiest nation on earth should go broke becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
nobodi should be abl to tell their daughter or son that the decis thei can and cannot make for themselv ar constrain becaus of some politician in washington __PUNCT__

and __PUNCT__ denver __PUNCT__ we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
we got too much work to do to implement health care __PUNCT__
we got too much work to do to creat good job __PUNCT__
we got too mani teacher that we got to hire __PUNCT__
we got too mani school we got to rebuild __PUNCT__
we got too mani student who still need afford higher educ __PUNCT__
there more homegrown energi to gener __PUNCT__
there ar more troop that we got to bring home __PUNCT__
there ar more door of opportun that we got to open to anybodi who will to work hard and walk through those door __PUNCT__
we got to keep build an economi where no matter what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ you can make it here if you try __PUNCT__
and you can leav someth behind for the next gener __PUNCT__
that what at stake right now __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
