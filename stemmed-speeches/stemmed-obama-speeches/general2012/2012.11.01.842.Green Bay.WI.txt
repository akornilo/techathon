we here todai becaus we believ that if thi countri invest in the skill and idea of it peopl __PUNCT__ then good job and busi will follow __PUNCT__
we believ that america free market ha been the engin of america progress __PUNCT__ driven by risk taker and innov and dreamer __PUNCT__
but we also understand that in thi countri __PUNCT__ peopl succe when thei got a chanc to get a good educ and learn new skill and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ so do the busi that hire those peopl or the compani that those folk start __PUNCT__
we believ that when we support research into medic breakthrough or new technolog __PUNCT__ then entir new industri will start here and stai here and hire here __PUNCT__
we don't believ govern should poke it nose into everyth we do __PUNCT__

we grow faster when our tax code reward hard work and compani that creat job here in america __PUNCT__
and we believ that qualiti __PUNCT__ afford health care and a dignifi retir aren't just achiev goal __PUNCT__ thei a measur of our valu as a nation __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we had a presid who share these belief __PUNCT__
hi name wa bill clinton __PUNCT__
when he wa first elect __PUNCT__ he ask the wealthiest american to pai a littl more __PUNCT__ so we could reduc the deficit and still make invest in thing like educ and train __PUNCT__ scienc and research __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ plenti of folk who were run for congress at the time said it would hurt the economi __PUNCT__ that it would kill job __PUNCT__
and if that argument sound familiar __PUNCT__ on of those candid back then happen to be run for presid right now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and it turn out their math wa just as bad back then as it is todai __PUNCT__
becaus by the end of bill clinton second term __PUNCT__ america had creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and incom were up __PUNCT__ and poverti wa down __PUNCT__
and our deficit becam the biggest surplu in our histori __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ we know the idea that work __PUNCT__
we also know the idea that don't work __PUNCT__
becaus in the __NUM__ year after bill clinton left offic __PUNCT__ hi polici were revers __PUNCT__
the wealthiest american got tax cut thei didn't need and that we couldn't afford __PUNCT__
compani enjoi tax break for ship job oversea __PUNCT__
insur compani and oil compani and wall street were given free licens to do what thei pleas __PUNCT__
folk at the top got to plai by a differ set of rule than the rest of us __PUNCT__
and the result of thi top __PUNCT__ down econom wa fall incom __PUNCT__ record deficit __PUNCT__ the slowest job growth in half a centuri __PUNCT__ and an econom crisi that we been clean up for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in the close week of thi campaign __PUNCT__ governor romnei ha been us all hi talent as a salesman to dress up these veri same polici that fail our countri so badli __PUNCT__ the veri same polici we been clean up after for the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__

leav million without health insur isn't chang __PUNCT__
anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that favor the wealthi isn't chang __PUNCT__
turn medicar into a voucher is chang __PUNCT__ but we don't want that chang __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ refus to answer question about the detail of your polici isn't chang __PUNCT__
rule out compromis by pledg to rubberstamp the tea parti agenda as presid __PUNCT__ that definit not chang __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
chang is a countri where american of everi ag have the skill and educ that good job now requir __PUNCT__
and govern can't do thi alon __PUNCT__ but don't tell me that hire more teacher won't help thi economi grow or help young peopl compet __PUNCT__
don't tell me that student who can't afford colleg should just borrow monei from their parent __PUNCT__
that wasn't an option for me __PUNCT__ and i bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be end colleg tax credit to pai for millionair __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ we should be make colleg more afford for everyon who will to work for it __PUNCT__
we should recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher so that high __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage job aren't creat in china __PUNCT__ thei creat right here in green bai __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__
we should work with commun colleg to train anoth __NUM__ million american with skill that busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
that my plan for the futur __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
that the america we fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang come when we live up to our legaci of innov and make america home to the next gener of manufactur __PUNCT__ scientif discoveri __PUNCT__ technolog breakthrough __PUNCT__
i proud i bet on american worker and american ingenu and the american auto industri __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ we not just build car again __PUNCT__ we build better car __PUNCT__ car that by the middl of the next decad will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar thousand of worker build long __PUNCT__ last batteri and wind turbin and solar panel all across the countri __PUNCT__ job that weren't there __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
and sure __PUNCT__ not all technolog we bet on will pan out __PUNCT__
some of the busi we encourag will fail __PUNCT__ but i promis you thi __PUNCT__ there is a futur for manufactur here in america __PUNCT__
there is a futur for clean energi here in america __PUNCT__
and i refus to cede that futur to other countri __PUNCT__
i don't want tax code reward compani for creat job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to reward compani that creat job here in america __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that subsid oil compani profit __PUNCT__ i want to support the energi job of tomorrow and the new technolog that will cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__
that my plan for job and growth __PUNCT__
that the futur of america that i see __PUNCT__
chang is final turn the page on a decad of war to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
but it time to us the save from end the war in iraq and afghanistan to start pai down our debt here and rebuild america __PUNCT__
right now we can put peopl back to work fix up road and bridg __PUNCT__
right now we can expand broadband into rural neighborhood and make sure our school ar state of the art __PUNCT__
let put american back to work do the work that need to be done __PUNCT__
and let especi focu on our veteran __PUNCT__ becaus no on who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that thei need when thei come home __PUNCT__
that my plan to keep us strong __PUNCT__
that my commit to you __PUNCT__
and that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang is a futur where we reduc our deficit in a wai that balanc and respons __PUNCT__
i sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend cut __PUNCT__
i intend to do more __PUNCT__
and i work with both parti to streamlin agenc and get rid of program that don't work __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about the deficit __PUNCT__ we also got to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the tax rate thei paid when bill clinton wa in offic __PUNCT__
becaus as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i will never turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i will never allow thi nation to be plung into anoth battl over health care reform just so insur compani can jump back into the driver seat __PUNCT__
and i will never allow politician in washington to control health care choic that women should be make for themselv __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ we know what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__
we don't need a big govern agenda or a small govern agenda __PUNCT__ we need a middl class agenda that reward hard work and respons __PUNCT__
we don't need a partisan agenda __PUNCT__ we need a commonsens agenda that sai when we educ a poor child __PUNCT__ we all be better off __PUNCT__ that sai when we fund the research of a young scientist __PUNCT__ her new discoveri will benefit everi american __PUNCT__
we need a vision that sai we don't just look out for ourselv __PUNCT__ we look out for on anoth other __PUNCT__ we look out for futur gener __PUNCT__ and we meet those oblig by work togeth __PUNCT__
that the chang we believ in __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let be clear __PUNCT__ achiev thi agenda won't be easi __PUNCT__
it never been easi __PUNCT__
we alwai knew that __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ when we talk about chang __PUNCT__ i told you i wasn't just talk about chang presid __PUNCT__
i wasn't just talk about chang parti __PUNCT__
i wa talk about chang our polit __PUNCT__
i ran becaus the voic of the american peopl __PUNCT__ your voic __PUNCT__ had been shut out of our democraci for wai too long __PUNCT__ by lobbyist and special interest and politician who believ that compromis is somehow a dirti word __PUNCT__ by folk who would sai anyth to win offic and do anyth to stai there __PUNCT__
the protector of the statu quo ar a power forc in washington __PUNCT__
and over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ everi time we tri to make a chang __PUNCT__ thei fought back with everyth thei got __PUNCT__
thei spent million to stop us from reform health care and wall street and student loan __PUNCT__
and their strategi from the start wa to engin pure gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that both democrat and republican had support in the past __PUNCT__
and what thei count on now __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ is that the american peopl will be so worn down by all the squabbl __PUNCT__ so tire of all the dysfunct __PUNCT__ that you actual reward obstruct and put peopl back in charg who advoc the veri polici that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ their bet is on cynic __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ my bet is on you __PUNCT__
my bet is on the decenc and good sens of the america peopl __PUNCT__ becaus despit all the resist __PUNCT__ despit all the setback __PUNCT__ we won some great fight __PUNCT__
and i never lost sight of the vision we share __PUNCT__ that you would have a voic __PUNCT__ that there would be somebodi at the tabl fight everi singl dai for middl class american who work hard __PUNCT__
sometim __PUNCT__ republican in congress have work with me to meet our goal __PUNCT__ to cut tax for small busi and famili like your __PUNCT__ to open new market for american good or final repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
and sometim we had big fight __PUNCT__ fight that were worth have __PUNCT__ like when we forc the bank to stop overcharg for student loan and made colleg more afford for million __PUNCT__
like when we forc wall street to abid by the toughest rule sinc the 1930 __PUNCT__
like when we stop insur compani from discrimin against american with preexist condit like cancer or diabet so that nobodi in america goe bankrupt just becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
i didn't fight those fight for ani partisan advantag __PUNCT__
i shown my willing to work with anybodi of ani parti to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and if you want to break the gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ you vote for leader __PUNCT__ whether thei ar democrat __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ or independ __PUNCT__ who feel the same wai __PUNCT__
but if the price of peac in washington is cut deal that will kick student off of financi aid or get rid of fund for plan parenthood or elimin health care for million on medicaid who ar poor or elderli or disabl just to give a millionair a tax cut __PUNCT__ i not have it __PUNCT__
that not a deal worth have __PUNCT__
that not bipartisanship __PUNCT__
that not chang __PUNCT__
that surrend to the same statu quo that ha hurt middl class famili for wai too long __PUNCT__
and i not readi to give up on that fight __PUNCT__
i hope you aren't either __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i hope you aren't either __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ the folk at the veri top in thi countri don't need anoth champion in washington __PUNCT__
thei alwai have a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__
thei alwai have access and influenc __PUNCT__
the peopl who need a champion ar the american whose letter i read late at night __PUNCT__ the men and women i meet on the campaign trail everi dai __PUNCT__
