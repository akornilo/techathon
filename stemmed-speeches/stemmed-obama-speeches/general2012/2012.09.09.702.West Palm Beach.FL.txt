both side have now made their argument __PUNCT__
and there a choic that we got to make __PUNCT__ and it the clearest choic we seen in a gener __PUNCT__ not just between two candid or two parti __PUNCT__ but a choic between two fundament differ vision of our futur __PUNCT__
we want to restor the basic bargain that built the largest middl class and the strongest economi the world ever known __PUNCT__ a bargain that sai hard work pai off __PUNCT__ that respons is reward __PUNCT__ that everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from main street to wall street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
that the basic bargain that led me to run for presid __PUNCT__
it what allow me and michel to have extraordinari opportun in our live __PUNCT__
and we want to make sure the next gener ha those same opportun __PUNCT__
and we had just gone through a decad in which job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__ and famili were have troubl make end meet __PUNCT__ and thei were have to rack up more debt just to pai tuition or fill up a ga tank __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
we spent the last 3Â½ year try to recov from all the damag that wa done __PUNCT__
and we made progress __PUNCT__ but not enough __PUNCT__
we got more to do __PUNCT__
and so now the question is __PUNCT__ which direct do we go __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the republican __PUNCT__ thei disagre with you __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
i love you __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__
thei had their convent here in florida and thei talk a lot about me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but thei didn't talk a lot about you __PUNCT__
thei talk about everyth thei think is wrong with america __PUNCT__ but thei didn't realli talk about how to make it right __PUNCT__
thei want your vote __PUNCT__ but thei didn't realli talk about their plan __PUNCT__
and that becaus their plan boil down to tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ gut a few regul __PUNCT__ and then some more tax cut __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ tax cut when time ar good __PUNCT__
tax cut when time ar bad __PUNCT__
tax cut when we got a surplu __PUNCT__
tax cut when we have a deficit __PUNCT__
tax cut to help you lose a few pound __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ tax cut to improv your love life __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ whatev is wrong with you __PUNCT__ thei think tax cut __PUNCT__ especi for folk at the top __PUNCT__ will cure all ill __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i cut tax for folk who need it __PUNCT__
for middl class famili __PUNCT__ for small busi __PUNCT__
but i don't believ anoth round of tax cut for millionair ar go to bring job back from oversea __PUNCT__
i don't think anoth round of tax cut for billionair that involv slash aid to student to pai for it or ask middl class famili to pai more __PUNCT__ that somehow that go to reduc the deficit or help grow our economi __PUNCT__
i certainli don't think that it make a lot of sens for us to be look at creat a voucher for medicar to pai for some tax cut for folk who don't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not how we made progress in thi countri __PUNCT__
i don't think roll back regul on wall street so that we don't have anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout is a smart idea __PUNCT__
i don't think roll back health care that is help american all across florida and all across the countri is a good idea __PUNCT__
i don't want to go backward __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__
we have done that __PUNCT__
it didn't work __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__

i never have __PUNCT__
these problem built up over decad __PUNCT__ thei go to take more than a few year to solv __PUNCT__
but we can move forward in the right direct __PUNCT__
and i am confid we got what it take __PUNCT__
our oppon __PUNCT__ thei been talk about how america is in declin __PUNCT__

we got the best univers in the world __PUNCT__ the best research in the world __PUNCT__

there not anoth nation on earth that wouldn't trade place with us __PUNCT__
our problem can be solv __PUNCT__

we ar go to put togeth a real __PUNCT__ achiev plan to build thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
it start with no longer ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let export good made here in america __PUNCT__
after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ we now creat half a million job over the last __NUM__ year just in manufactur __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top __PUNCT__
so we can take mr __PUNCT__ romnei advic and continu to give even more tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can reward compani that ar invest in new job and new worker and new factori here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
i want to help american factori and small busi export more __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
you can make that happen __PUNCT__
second part of our plan __PUNCT__ let control our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on the same gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that good for your pocketbook __PUNCT__
it good for the environ __PUNCT__
we doubl our us of renew energi like wind and solar __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ thousand of american have job build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ the unit state is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
so you have a choic __PUNCT__
we can build on that progress __PUNCT__ or we can revers it like my oppon recommend __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i think he wrong __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i don't intend to let oil compani write our countri energi plan or endang our coastlin __PUNCT__
and i don't want them to keep collect __MONEY__ billion of corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__
we keep invest in wind and solar __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and truck __PUNCT__ construct worker build home and factori that ar more energi effici __PUNCT__ develop a hundr year __PUNCT__ suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__
we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and support more than __NUM__ new job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
that move forward __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we go to build on the reform we have initi and make sure that american ar get the chanc to get the skill thei need to compet in thi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
educ wa the kei to opportun for me __PUNCT__ the kei to opportun for michel __PUNCT__ the kei to opportun for mani of you __PUNCT__
it the gatewai to a middl class life __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ for the first time in a gener __PUNCT__ we push everi state almost __PUNCT__ to answer our call to rais standard for teach and __URL__ of the worst school in the nation have made real gain in read and math __PUNCT__
million of student ar save monei __PUNCT__ pai less for colleg __PUNCT__ becaus of the work we did to keep the student loan program on track and improv the pell grant program __PUNCT__
so you can take their advic and gut educ __PUNCT__
or we can decid in the unit state __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom or becaus a famili can't afford to send her to colleg __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for a worker someplac els becaus thei couldn't find the right skill for worker here in the unit state __PUNCT__
so i need you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
let provid __NUM__ million more worker the chanc to learn skill at commun colleg for job that ar out there right now __PUNCT__
and let work with colleg and univers to lower tuition __PUNCT__ becaus it is not a luxuri for young peopl __PUNCT__
it is a necess __PUNCT__
that what i mean when i sai we need to move forward __PUNCT__ not backward __PUNCT__
we can meet these goal togeth __PUNCT__
my plan would reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
independ analysi show my plan would reduc our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
we got the math all done __PUNCT__
we laid it out there __PUNCT__
peopl have evalu it __PUNCT__
peopl have analyz it __PUNCT__
i alreadi work with the republican in congress to cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__
and i will to do more with republican __PUNCT__
i want to reform our tax code so that it simpl and it fair __PUNCT__
but i also think it make sens for folk like me to pai higher tax on our incom over __MONEY__ the same rate bill clinton had when he wa presid __PUNCT__ the same rate that creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ a lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i guess my oppon ha a plan __PUNCT__
but there on thing miss from it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
arithmet __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
arithmet __PUNCT__
give that young ladi an __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ she been do her homework __PUNCT__
when governor romnei and hi alli in congress sai that the most import thing is to lower our deficit __PUNCT__ and then he start by call for trillion of dollar more in new tax break for wealthi folk __PUNCT__
and thei were ask about it todai __PUNCT__
thei couldn't answer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei couldn't answer the question of how __PUNCT__ you alreadi have deficit __PUNCT__ you add __MONEY__ trillion of new tax cut __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion in new defens spend __PUNCT__ and somehow you go to close the deficit without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__ thei did not take their arithmet cours __PUNCT__
thei need to talk to thi young ladi and get some tutor __PUNCT__
thei need to stai after school __PUNCT__
thei need to get some extra studi hall in there __PUNCT__
no recess for you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i refus to go along with a plan that ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor and elderli or disabl just so those with the most can pai less __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ and i want you to hear me now __PUNCT__ i will never turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
we won't do that __PUNCT__
here what you need to know __PUNCT__
i have strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
we ad year to the life of medicar __PUNCT__
we did it by get rid of taxpay subsidi to insur compani that weren't make peopl healthier __PUNCT__
the other side know that __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ it wa in their budget __PUNCT__ all the save we achiev __PUNCT__
now thei pretend like somehow it affect beneficiari when thei know it doesn't __PUNCT__
we took that monei that wa go to the insur compani __PUNCT__ us part of it to help lower prescript drug cost for senior __PUNCT__ to offer free prevent care for senior __PUNCT__
we thought that wa a good idea __PUNCT__
thei mai think it a bad idea __PUNCT__ but i don't __PUNCT__
thei want to give the monei back to the insur compani __PUNCT__ put them in charg of medicar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
there wa on report that just said that by the end of the next decad under their plan __PUNCT__ you would see as much as __MONEY__ to __NUM__ billion in new profit for insur compani __PUNCT__ paid for by taxpay __PUNCT__
why would we do that __PUNCT__ the cost to folk who ar current on medicar could rise by thousand of dollar so that insur compani ar make those billion of dollar in profit __PUNCT__
that not a good plan __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so here the bottom line __PUNCT__ their plan bankrupt medicar over the long term and __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ over the short term __PUNCT__ mean the trust fund run out of monei by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
our plan strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
i believ no american should ever have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
i believ everi american who work hard should be abl to retir with the digniti that thei have earn __PUNCT__
and i want to be honest with you __PUNCT__ we go to have to strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ and that requir some reform __PUNCT__
but we do it by reform the wai that health care deliveri system work so that we reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by ask senior to pai thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
and we go to keep the promis of social secur by take the respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ not by turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ our prosper at home is link to our polici abroad __PUNCT__ and i got a track record that you can look at __PUNCT__
i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
i said we begin bring troop home from afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
and while a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ and as we paus to rememb those that were lost thi come tuesdai on __DATE__ we know that al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
so we got a track record that you can look at __PUNCT__
and as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
our troop when thei take off those uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus thei shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
but my oppon ha a differ idea __PUNCT__
he said the wai we end the war in iraq wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ doesn't have a plan to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ if you don't even mention afghanistan __PUNCT__ that a problem when you accept the nomin __PUNCT__
so i assum he doesn't have a plan __PUNCT__
and while my oppon would spend more monei on militari program that our joint chief don't even want __PUNCT__ at a time when we suppos to be reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ i us the monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and put more peopl back to work rebuild bridg and road and school and runwai __PUNCT__
we need to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that what we need to do __PUNCT__
so that the choic we now face __PUNCT__
that what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
the other side sai bigger tax cut and fewer regul ar the onli wai __PUNCT__
