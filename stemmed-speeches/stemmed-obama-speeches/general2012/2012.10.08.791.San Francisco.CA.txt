we alreadi work with democrat and republican to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__

but we cannot just cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
we cannot get thi done unless we ask the wealthiest household to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ creat a whole lot of millionair and success small busi as well __PUNCT__

that is not what ha built thi countri __PUNCT__
that is not what we believ __PUNCT__
that is not what go to happen __PUNCT__
we ar go to go forward __PUNCT__ not backward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ san francisco __PUNCT__ california __PUNCT__ thi is the choic we now face __PUNCT__
it what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
over and over __PUNCT__ we ar told by oppon that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
basic philosophi is __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
compani ar releas pollut that our kid ar breath __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that just the price of progress __PUNCT__
you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ just borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ in individu initi __PUNCT__
we believ that we can't help folk who don't want to try to help themselv __PUNCT__ but we also believ in opportun __PUNCT__
we also believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we also understand that america is not about what can be done for us __PUNCT__
it about what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
that what you all understood in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that what chang wa about __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ all of us __PUNCT__ come togeth __PUNCT__
you the reason there a littl girl somewher here in california who is go to get the care she need becaus an insur compani can't impos some sort of lifetim limit on her coverag __PUNCT__
you the reason a factori worker who lost hi job in toledo or lordstown __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ is back on the line build some of the best car in the world __PUNCT__
you the reason that a student right here ha help pai for a colleg educ or a veteran can go to school on the new gi bill __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here __PUNCT__ pledg allegi to our flag __PUNCT__ will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason why a soldier who ha serv us so brave will not be kick out of the militari becaus of who thei love __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you the reason that soldier can come home to hi love on and hear those word __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__

and so i need you in thi elect __PUNCT__
the next __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to be complac __PUNCT__ and we cannot afford to be cynic __PUNCT__
we got to look back at the progress we made __PUNCT__ and that should give us confid __PUNCT__
but we have to understand __PUNCT__ we got a lot more to do __PUNCT__
and if we don't do it __PUNCT__ then chang won't happen __PUNCT__
your voic will make a differ __PUNCT__
and if you don't make that differ __PUNCT__ then other peopl will fill the void __PUNCT__
lobbyist and special interest and the folk who write the __MONEY__ million check to try to win thi race and the on who ar try to make it harder for peopl to vote __PUNCT__ the politician in washington who somehow think that thei got a better idea than women about women health care choic __PUNCT__ those ar the folk that ar go to be make decis if you ar not make those decis __PUNCT__
onli you can make sure those thing don't happen __PUNCT__
onli you got the power to move us forward __PUNCT__
i will be there with you __PUNCT__ but thi is a team __PUNCT__ peopl __PUNCT__
from the dai we began thi campaign __PUNCT__ i alwai said that chang take time __PUNCT__

we said it would take more than on parti __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it doesn't just take me __PUNCT__
that not the deal __PUNCT__
the deal is it take all of us __PUNCT__
that the deal __PUNCT__
it won't happen if you got somebodi who write off half the nation even befor he take offic __PUNCT__
but it also won't happen if half the nation write off itself by not particip or doesn't vote __PUNCT__
