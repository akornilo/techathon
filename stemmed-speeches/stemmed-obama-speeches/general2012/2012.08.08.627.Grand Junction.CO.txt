but unless you been abl to hide the televis complet or your cabl is broke __PUNCT__ then you mai be awar there a pretti intens campaign go on right now __PUNCT__
and the reason it such an intens campaign is becaus the choic that we face in __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__
thi is not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
it a choic about two fundament differ vision for the countri __PUNCT__ two fundament differ path __PUNCT__
and the direct that we choos __PUNCT__ the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth in less than __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ is go to have a direct impact not just on our live __PUNCT__ but on the live of our children and our grandchildren for decad to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and some republican __PUNCT__ to restor the basic bargain that had built thi countri __PUNCT__ that had made us the most prosper nation on earth __PUNCT__
and it a veri simpl bargain __PUNCT__
it sai __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ your work will be reward __PUNCT__
it sai that if you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ you can find a job that pai a decent wage __PUNCT__ pai the bill __PUNCT__ that you can afford to have a home that you call your own __PUNCT__ that you have health care you can count on when you get sick __PUNCT__ that after a lifetim of labor __PUNCT__ you can put awai enough to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ that you can give your kid the kind of educ and opportun that allow them to dream even bigger and do even better than you could ever imagin __PUNCT__
that the promis of america __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that the promis of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when we came togeth __PUNCT__ we knew restor that bargain __PUNCT__ that deal __PUNCT__ that compact __PUNCT__ wa not go to be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it would take more than on year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ becaus we had seen what had happen in the previou decad __PUNCT__
job had move oversea __PUNCT__
folk were work harder and harder __PUNCT__ but their wage or incom __PUNCT__ thei were stai flat __PUNCT__ sometim even go down __PUNCT__
the cost of everyth from health care to colleg wa go up __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ it all culmin in the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ a crisi that rob too mani of our friend and our neighbor of job __PUNCT__ the valu of their home __PUNCT__ their save __PUNCT__
and all that push the american dream even further out of reach for too mani work peopl __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ we spent the last 3½ year dig ourselv out of that hole __PUNCT__
we avert a depress __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ __NUM__ in manufactur __PUNCT__
we save an auto industri __PUNCT__
we made sure that we work to make colleg more afford __PUNCT__
we work to make sure that health care wa secur for famili __PUNCT__
and what we discov dure the cours of these difficult time is that a crisi doesn't chang our charact __PUNCT__
it doesn't chang who we ar as a peopl __PUNCT__
it doesn't chang what make us great __PUNCT__ our tough __PUNCT__ our grit __PUNCT__ our resili __PUNCT__ and our abil to come togeth and work togeth on behalf of thi countri __PUNCT__
and when we came togeth in __NUM__ we understood that there is a core decenc __PUNCT__ that there is a good to the american peopl __PUNCT__ and we need to make sure that that reflect in what happen in washington __PUNCT__
and our mission ha never been more urgent __PUNCT__
so after 3½ tough year __PUNCT__ we still go __PUNCT__
we here to build an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ so that no matter who you ar or what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ understand __PUNCT__ there ar no quick fix or easi solut to some of these challeng __PUNCT__
but here the thing that i constantli am remind of wherev i travel across the countri __PUNCT__ we have the capac to meet ani challeng __PUNCT__ becaus we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research in the world and the best colleg and the best univers in the world __PUNCT__
we still a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__ and peopl want to come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
and so no matter what the naysay tell us __PUNCT__ no matter how dark the other side tri to make thing look __PUNCT__ the fact is __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that would not gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so we can solv our problem __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai is not that we don't have good idea or we don't have solut to problem like energi independ or improv our school __PUNCT__
what is stand in our wai is our polit __PUNCT__
you got a bunch of folk in washington who think the onli wai is their wai and who think that the onli wai to go forward is to go right back to the same polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei believ in the old top __PUNCT__ down econom that we spent an entir decad try and that did not work __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ i not exagger here __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ and hi friend in congress __PUNCT__ when you look at their econom idea __PUNCT__ when you look at __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ thei spent a lot of time on commerci __PUNCT__ sai how there aren't enough job and the economi is not grow fast enough __PUNCT__
and then you ask them __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what is it that you think about do __PUNCT__ and you know __PUNCT__ i am not exagger __PUNCT__ it boil down to two thing __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ thei want to give more tax cut to folk at the veri top __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
five trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of tax cut on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ so that idea number on __PUNCT__
idea number two is let get rid of regul that we put into place to make sure that wall street doe not misbehav again and we don't have anoth meltdown or get rid of regul that help protect our air and our water or get rid of regul that protect consum from unscrupul lender __PUNCT__
that their basic idea __PUNCT__
you get rid of regul __PUNCT__ and you cut tax for wealthi american __PUNCT__ and somehow job and prosper will all rain down on all of us __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thi is the path thei propos __PUNCT__
if you think i exagger __PUNCT__ you go to their web site __PUNCT__ you look at the bill that have been pass by thi hous of repres __PUNCT__
that is where thei will take us if thei win __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of mr __PUNCT__ romnei entir econom plan is thi new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ i want you to pai attent here __PUNCT__ we go to do a littl math __PUNCT__
i know it not everybodi favorit subject __PUNCT__ but math is import __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
i love math __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i like that __PUNCT__ somebodi said thei love math __PUNCT__
there you go __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ so we known for a while that a lot of thi new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut would go to the wealthiest __NUM__ percent of all household __PUNCT__
but last week __PUNCT__ an independ nonpartisan organ crunch the number __PUNCT__
thei look __PUNCT__ what doe thi mean __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ the defens budget is about __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
so a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut is __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ year is like a tax cut that as big as our entir defens budget everi singl year __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ so these gui were try to analyz what doe thi mean __PUNCT__
thei found that governor romnei plan would rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason is __PUNCT__ as he sai __PUNCT__ that thi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut he pai for by do other thing __PUNCT__ by slash educ or make medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but even after he make all the cut to educ and train and scienc and research and transport and environment protect __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__ it turn out __PUNCT__ he is still short __PUNCT__
so the onli wai that you could actual pai for it is to have you pick up the bill __PUNCT__
so you would then pai __MONEY__ extra everi year not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ not to help our kid get an educ __PUNCT__ not to rebuild our road and our bridg or lai broadband line into rural commun __PUNCT__
he would ask the middl class to pai more in tax so he could give anoth __MONEY__ to peopl make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ he wa ask about thi __PUNCT__ hi campaign wa ask about it __PUNCT__ and if thi sound like an idea that would be difficult to explain to the american peopl __PUNCT__ you right __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ let just sai there wa a whole differ kind of gymnast be perform by mr __PUNCT__ romnei than what been happen in the olymp __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so thei were twist __PUNCT__ and thei were turn and do backflip and try to sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi is a bias report __PUNCT__ despit the fact that the head of thi nonpartisan center us to work for presid bush __PUNCT__
but it not surpris that he wa try to scrambl a littl bit __PUNCT__ becaus thei tri to sell thi old __PUNCT__ trickl __PUNCT__ down tax cut fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you know what __PUNCT__ it did not work then __PUNCT__
it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to lower the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
it not a plan to build the middl class __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for folk like me __PUNCT__
we need tax cut for work american who ar try to rais a famili and keep our famili healthi and send our kid to colleg and keep a roof over their head __PUNCT__
that who need some help __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that why i run for presid __PUNCT__ to fight for you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you gui still bend your knee __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__
you got some water __PUNCT__ get hydrat __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
sing for us __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
michel made me promis that i can't sing to other anymor __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus she want me to just sing to her __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but look __PUNCT__ grand junction __PUNCT__ i got a differ plan for america __PUNCT__
their idea aren't go to work __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__
that exactli what i done __PUNCT__
the typic famili ha seen their tax go down by about __MONEY__
so when you talk to your friend or neighbor and thei sai __PUNCT__ he a big __PUNCT__ spend __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__ rais democrat __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you got to tell them __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ if you in the middl class __PUNCT__ your tax have gone down __PUNCT__
so now i want to keep tax exactli where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make under __NUM__ __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of american do __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi do __PUNCT__ you will not see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
that my plan __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i told congress __PUNCT__ i told the republican in congress __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ let do it now __PUNCT__
you gui sai you don't want to see anybodi tax go up __PUNCT__ i don't want to see anybodi who make __MONEY__ or less see their tax go up __PUNCT__
let go ahead and sign a bill __PUNCT__
but shockingli enough __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei haven't agre so far __PUNCT__ becaus thei hold you gui hostag to try to get tax cut for the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ you still go to get a tax cut on the first __MONEY__ of your incom __PUNCT__
so if you make __NUM__ the first __NUM__ you still keep all that tax cut __PUNCT__
it just that littl bit over __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you make __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__ you can afford it __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ all we ask for folk who have been bless __PUNCT__ like me __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ i not be self __PUNCT__ interest here __PUNCT__
it not like i love pai tax __PUNCT__ but i understand i got certain oblig becaus thi countri ha been so good to me __PUNCT__
so what i __PUNCT__ all we sai is for folk in the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ let go back to what we were pai under bill clinton __PUNCT__
let contribut a littl bit more so we pai down our deficit and we can still invest in thing like educ that help our kid succe __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ just in case you talk to your friend or neighbor again and thei sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that just __PUNCT__ a littl bit of tax increas on the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that won't cut the deficit __PUNCT__ thei right __PUNCT__
we got to do more __PUNCT__
so we alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
feder spend is grow at a slower rate than ani time sinc dwight eisenhow __PUNCT__
i make sure govern continu to do it part __PUNCT__ and we cut out spend we don't need __PUNCT__
but i not go to pai for a massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair by gut invest that have alwai made us strong as a countri __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ just like we test their plan under the previou administr and it didn't work __PUNCT__ we test my plan becaus __PUNCT__ as you recal __PUNCT__ under bill clinton __PUNCT__ when those tax were a littl bit higher on folk like me __PUNCT__ the economi grew faster than it ha in year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
we went from a deficit to a surplu __PUNCT__
and folk at the top did well __PUNCT__
we creat a lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and the reason is that __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ when a construct worker ha a got a littl monei in hi pocket __PUNCT__ now he start think about bui a new car __PUNCT__
when a teacher ha secur in her job __PUNCT__ now she might go to a restaur onc in a while __PUNCT__
and so what happen is __PUNCT__ when the middl class is strong __PUNCT__ suddenli __PUNCT__ busi have more custom __PUNCT__ busi have more profit __PUNCT__ busi decid to hire more worker __PUNCT__
everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that how we build a strong economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
obama __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai __PUNCT__ you can see how thi plai out on a whole bunch of issu __PUNCT__ not just tax and the deficit __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ million job at stake __PUNCT__ governor romnei sai __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i said let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so now i want to make sure that the job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ includ advanc manufactur job __PUNCT__ that thei not take root in china or germani __PUNCT__
i want them to take root in colorado __PUNCT__ in ohio __PUNCT__ in michigan __PUNCT__
governor romnei and i have a differ theori __PUNCT__
he spent hi privat sector experi invest in compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
i want to insourc __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give those tax break to compani that ar invest in colorado __PUNCT__ invest in grand junction __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ sell american product __PUNCT__ stamp those good with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei sai it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ for me to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ like i promis __PUNCT__
i think after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
thank to the incred servic of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ iraq is in charg of it own destini __PUNCT__
we ar bring troop home from afghanistan __PUNCT__
we went after bin laden and al qaida __PUNCT__ and we got them __PUNCT__
so now let take half of the save that we were spend on war __PUNCT__ and let us it to put peopl back to work rebuild school __PUNCT__ rebuild bridg __PUNCT__ rebuild road __PUNCT__ improv our airport system __PUNCT__ improv our port so that we can move good and servic that will make our economi strong not just now __PUNCT__ but in the futur __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that also help us pai for provid servic that our men and women in uniform have earn __PUNCT__
our veteran fought too hard for us for them to have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that is a sacr trust we got to keep __PUNCT__
i run to make sure america onc again lead the world in educ our kid __PUNCT__
i want to hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
help __NUM__ million peopl go to commun colleg to train for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that everi young person can afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__
we have alreadi expand student aid __PUNCT__ now we need to bring tuition down __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__ to give our young peopl a chanc __PUNCT__
on everi issu __PUNCT__ there a differ __PUNCT__
on hous and foreclosur __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei sai let the market just bottom out __PUNCT__
i sai let let everi american refin their home at histor low rate __PUNCT__ save __MONEY__ per famili __PUNCT__ per homeown __PUNCT__
that could actual boost the economi and strengthen the hous market __PUNCT__
when it come to health care __PUNCT__ he want to kill obamacar __PUNCT__
i implement obamacar becaus it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ as we speak __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million young peopl under the ag of __NUM__ can stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__
million of senior have save hundr of dollar on their prescript drug __PUNCT__ and we close the doughnut hole __PUNCT__
individu and busi ar get rebat from their insur compani becaus insur compani have to us most of the monei thei get in premium to provid care __PUNCT__ not for ceo bonus and administr cost __PUNCT__
if your child ha a preexist condit __PUNCT__ insur compani can't turn them down __PUNCT__
soon __PUNCT__ adult who have preexist condit cannot be turn down __PUNCT__
so if that what mr __PUNCT__ romnei want to get rid of __PUNCT__ despit the fact that he did the same thing in massachusett and it work pretti well __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ then that a differ __PUNCT__ that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i don't think we should be refight some of the battl he want to refight __PUNCT__
i think it wa the right thing to do to end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
i think you should be abl to serv your countri no matter who you ar __PUNCT__
i don't think it make sens for us to take awai control that women have over their own health care decis __PUNCT__
but most of all __PUNCT__ most of all __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that that origin bargain that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that basic idea that if you work hard you can make it __PUNCT__ that that is restor __PUNCT__
and everyth we do __PUNCT__ from health care to educ __PUNCT__ to manufactur __PUNCT__ to our infrastructur __PUNCT__ to our invest in scienc and research __PUNCT__ all of thi is design to make sure that we got a strong middl class go forward __PUNCT__ that no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ where you come from __PUNCT__ that everybodi ha got a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
that the same promis our parent and our grandpar and our great __PUNCT__ grandpar believ in __PUNCT__
and now we got to pass on that same promis to the next gener __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the last __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ to be precis __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the other side will be spend more monei than we ever seen __PUNCT__
you got these gui write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
you got these super pac that ar just go crazi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__
i don't know why thei run all these ad __PUNCT__ becaus basic __PUNCT__ thei onli have on ad __PUNCT__
it just a variat on the same ad __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it should be and it obama fault __PUNCT__
that their basic argument __PUNCT__
becaus thei know thei can't sell their actual plan __PUNCT__ thei don't have plan __PUNCT__
their messag is design to try to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
but i do __PUNCT__
and so when you talk to your friend and your neighbor __PUNCT__ and thei sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ he ran a busi and i think mayb that might work __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ if you believ that try what we alreadi tri and it didn't work is worth try again __PUNCT__ if you believ it okai to cut tax for folk who ar do realli well and ask folk who ar struggl to do more __PUNCT__ if you think it okai for us to cut back on our invest in educ and scienc and set our sight lower __PUNCT__ then their __PUNCT__ that your choic __PUNCT__
that how our democraci work __PUNCT__
try it out __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ if you believ that we on the right track __PUNCT__ if you think like i do that we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__ then i go to need you __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
we got too mani good job to creat __PUNCT__
we got too mani good teacher to hire __PUNCT__
we got too mani great school to build __PUNCT__
we got too mani student we need to help go to colleg __PUNCT__
we got too much homegrown clean energi to gener __PUNCT__
we got more troop to bring home __PUNCT__
we got more door of opportun to open to everybodi who is will to work hard __PUNCT__ to walk through that door __PUNCT__
we got to leav someth behind for the next gener so thei can do even better __PUNCT__ so thei can do even bigger than we ever imagin __PUNCT__
that what at stake __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
and if you will to stand with me and if you still believ in me just like i believ in you __PUNCT__ we will win __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
we will win thi elect __PUNCT__
