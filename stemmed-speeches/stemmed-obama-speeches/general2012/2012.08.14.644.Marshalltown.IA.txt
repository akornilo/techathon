four year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ we had independ __PUNCT__ we had some republican __PUNCT__ becaus we understood that the basic bargain that built thi countri wa at stake __PUNCT__
we had gone through a decad where job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__ where incom were go down even while the cost of health care and a colleg educ and groceri were go up __PUNCT__ and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and what we understood then wa we had to work hard to get back to that basic bargain __PUNCT__ that basic deal that built thi countri __PUNCT__

that is what the american promis is all about __PUNCT__
that what we been fight for __PUNCT__
that what we been fight for __PUNCT__
and we knew it wasn't go to happen overnight __PUNCT__
we knew it wa go to take more than on term __PUNCT__ mayb even on presid __PUNCT__ to get thi countri back to the place where everybodi ha got a fair shot __PUNCT__
but we start __PUNCT__
and 3½ year ago __PUNCT__ we save ourselv from go into a great depress __PUNCT__
and 4½ million job have been creat __PUNCT__ and half a million manufactur job __PUNCT__
and the auto industri got save __PUNCT__
we ar now at a point where a lot of folk ar still struggl __PUNCT__
and so we got to move forward and not backward __PUNCT__
we got to move forward __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
best presid __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
and we a young nation __PUNCT__
we a young nation __PUNCT__ in part becaus we got thi incred divers __PUNCT__
peopl ar will to come here from all corner of the globe becaus thei understand there someth special about thi place __PUNCT__
and so for all the naysay out there and the folk who try to paint thing as dark as thei can __PUNCT__ especi dure elect time __PUNCT__ the fact of the matter is there no nation on earth that wouldn't trade place with us __PUNCT__
so we got the tool to make sure that we ar live up to thi countri promis __PUNCT__ a countri where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what faith you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what race you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
that what we have the opportun to make sure continu for the next gener __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there is on thing hold back __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ and that is the polit in washington __PUNCT__
we got __PUNCT__ the other side ha decid that compromis is a dirti word __PUNCT__
and thei spend a lot of time try to beat me instead of move the countri forward __PUNCT__
but part of it is just an honest disagr about how we move the countri forward __PUNCT__
governor romnei chose a run mate thi weekend __PUNCT__ and i know congressman ryan __PUNCT__
he a good man __PUNCT__ he a good famili man __PUNCT__
but he got a fundament differ view about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
he an articul spokesperson for governor romnei view __PUNCT__
he the ideolog leader of the republican in congress __PUNCT__
but that vision is wrong __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ you can sum up governor romnei plan pretti simpli __PUNCT__
he want to elimin __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
everyth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__
he want to elimin regul on big bank and corpor __PUNCT__ some of which we put in place in the wake of the disast on wall street __PUNCT__
and he want to institut even more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of hi plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it which would go to folk like me who don't need it __PUNCT__
and here the kicker __PUNCT__
he expect all of you to pick up the tab __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ don't take my word for it __PUNCT__
independ analysi show that if hi plan wa institut __PUNCT__ the onli wai you could pai for it would be to have the averag middl class famili with children pai an extra __MONEY__ in tax __PUNCT__
how mani peopl think that a good idea __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
how mani peopl think that would actual grow the economi __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but that hi theori __PUNCT__
the theori is __PUNCT__ is that if folk up here ar do realli well __PUNCT__ then all the benefit ar go to trickl down __PUNCT__
the extra __MONEY__ you be pai wouldn't be us to pai down the deficit or the debt that we alreadi got __PUNCT__
it wouldn't be to invest in more teacher or a better school system or make colleg more afford or rebuild our road and bridg and find new wai to creat cheap energi __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ thi __MONEY__ would be to help financ an averag __MONEY__ tax break for folk make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i got to tell you __PUNCT__ we have heard thi sale pitch from these folk befor __PUNCT__
we heard thi trickl __PUNCT__ down fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it will not work now __PUNCT__
we don't think it a plan to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
it certainli not a plan to creat job and to help famili right now __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i believ in a differ theori __PUNCT__
when it come to tax __PUNCT__ i said in __NUM__ i wa go to lower middl class tax __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
so the averag famili __PUNCT__ the typic famili __PUNCT__ is pai __MONEY__ less in tax than thei were when i came into offic __PUNCT__
so what i believ now is i want to keep your incom tax right where thei ar for everybodi make __MONEY__ or less __PUNCT__ which is __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__
and folk who ar in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ who ar fortun enough to be in the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ thei still get a tax cut for the first __MONEY__
but after that __PUNCT__ we ask them to pai a littl bit more so we can financ thing like educ and reduc our deficit in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i still want to make sure that govern doe it part by be good steward of taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
so we cut a trillion dollar out of feder spend __PUNCT__ a trillion dollar that i alreadi sign into law __PUNCT__
we got an addit trillion that slate __PUNCT__
so we prepar to make some tough choic on thing we can't afford __PUNCT__
but we not go to reduc the deficit by gut educ invest __PUNCT__ gut invest that we make in our infrastructur __PUNCT__ gut our invest in basic scienc and research that can lead to discoveri in clean energi or lead to discoveri in cure cancer __PUNCT__
that not how we go to grow thi economi and make sure that the middl class is strong __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ when i sai ask folk like me to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__ we tri that befor too __PUNCT__ under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from a deficit to a surplu __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ marshalltown __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__ it actual wa good for rich peopl __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
becaus what happen is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ when a teacher or a construct worker or a receptionist or a nurs __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
thei spend it on necess __PUNCT__
and so mayb you got a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car __PUNCT__ and you go out and bui a new on __PUNCT__
or mayb you need a new applianc __PUNCT__ and you go out __PUNCT__ and you get a new applianc __PUNCT__
or mayb you bui a comput for your kid as thei go off to colleg __PUNCT__
and suddenli __PUNCT__ busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ and those busi get more profit __PUNCT__ and thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
we don't believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
the histori of thi countri ha been a middl class __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__ a bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
when everybodi is do well __PUNCT__ when everybodi ha opportun __PUNCT__ then we all succe and the countri move forward __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
you see the differ in philosophi on almost everi issu __PUNCT__
when the automak were on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ a million job at stake __PUNCT__ governor romnei said let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and 3½ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so we know american manufactur can succe in thi countri __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur __PUNCT__ advanc manufactur __PUNCT__ but we got to make sure we got a tax code that encourag it __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give tax break to compani that ar invest here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ make american product __PUNCT__
governor romnei ha got a differ view __PUNCT__
he talk about how he ha been in the privat sector __PUNCT__ so he know how to put folk back to work __PUNCT__
but it turn out most of hi busi wa invest on behalf of folk like him and invest in some case in what ha been call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
we don't need pioneer of outsourc __PUNCT__
we need folk who ar interest in insourc and bring some job back to marshalltown __PUNCT__ back to iowa __PUNCT__ and back to the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let me give you anoth exampl __PUNCT__
kirk wa just talk about wind power __PUNCT__
i wa just visit a wind farm close by __PUNCT__
it a work farm __PUNCT__
it ha about five windmil on on properti __PUNCT__ __NUM__ in thi area __PUNCT__ __NUM__ wind farm gener incred amount of energi and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ help famili farmer with a littl bit of extra incom __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ governor romnei ha decid that we should end the tax credit that we provid for wind power onc and for all __PUNCT__
that hi idea __PUNCT__
he want to get rid of it __PUNCT__
at a moment when homegrown energi is creat new job here in state like iowa __PUNCT__ he want to bring an end to it __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ and i quot here __PUNCT__ he said new sourc of energi like these ar __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
hi run mate __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ call them a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
then dure a speech a few month ago __PUNCT__ governor romnei explain hi energi polici thi wai __PUNCT__ you can't drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__
that what he said about wind power __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know he tri some other thing on top of a car __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i didn't know he had tri windmil on top of a car __PUNCT__
but mayb he tri it __PUNCT__
i would have like to have seen that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but mayb he need to come to iowa to learn someth about wind power __PUNCT__
he know if he came here that __NUM__ job have been creat here in iowa by the wind industri __PUNCT__ more than ani other state in america __PUNCT__
these job aren't a fad __PUNCT__ thei the futur __PUNCT__ and we got to be invest in them __PUNCT__
if he came to iowa __PUNCT__ he might know that not onli ar we put up these windmil __PUNCT__ but increasingli __PUNCT__ thei made right here in iowa __PUNCT__ made here in america __PUNCT__
that not imaginari __PUNCT__ that real __PUNCT__
if he came here to iowa __PUNCT__ he might know that __NUM__ percent of iowa electr now come from wind energi __PUNCT__
over the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ america ha doubl it __PUNCT__ the amount of electr that is produc from wind __PUNCT__ and thi is enough to power __NUM__ million home with clean and renew energi __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
it the equival of __NUM__ hoover dam worth of electr is be gener by wind power in thi countri __PUNCT__
that someth that worth invest in __PUNCT__
that someth we do for the next gener __PUNCT__
and so ar the __NUM__ american job that ar on the line if we let thi wind tax credit expir __PUNCT__
so thi is a differ between me and governor romnei __PUNCT__
i want to stop give __MONEY__ billion in taxpay subsidi everi singl year to the oil compani that ar do just great __PUNCT__ and let take some of that monei and continu to invest in homegrown __PUNCT__ renew energi right here in iowa and all across america that can put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
i give you anoth exampl of a differ __PUNCT__
i said in __NUM__ i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i said we refocu and go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
we bring our troop home from afghanistan __PUNCT__
all thi is possibl becaus of the extraordinari servic and sacrific of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
so we made some histor invest in the va __PUNCT__
my attitud is anybodi who ha fought for america __PUNCT__ thei shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
we got to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
but we also need to make sure that folk come home __PUNCT__ thei come back to a vibrant economi __PUNCT__
so what i said is let take half of the monei that we save after a decad of war and let put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
let creat a veteran job corp that can hire polic offic and firefight in commun that need them __PUNCT__
let get a whole bunch of construct worker to rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ our port and our airport __PUNCT__
let rebuild our school __PUNCT__
let lai broadband line into rural commun __PUNCT__
those invest ar good now becaus thei put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ and that mean folk have got more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__
and what do thei do when thei got more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei spend it __PUNCT__
and suddenli __PUNCT__ busi have more custom __PUNCT__
but it also good for the long run __PUNCT__ becaus if we got the best road __PUNCT__ the best bridg __PUNCT__ the best airport __PUNCT__ the fastest broadband line __PUNCT__ the best wireless network __PUNCT__ the best transmiss line __PUNCT__ all that make us more product __PUNCT__ and it mean our economi is go to grow in the futur __PUNCT__
so why wouldn't we start now __PUNCT__ that what we need to be invest in __PUNCT__
so look __PUNCT__ on more differ __PUNCT__ when it come to educ __PUNCT__ i believ that noth is more import than make our kid competit in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
our young peopl __PUNCT__ thei not just compet against folk in north carolina or new hampshir __PUNCT__ thei now compet against folk in india and china __PUNCT__
so i want to make sure that we help school district hire and retain the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that we creat __NUM__ million more slot in commun colleg so folk can get train in the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to make colleg more afford for young peopl __PUNCT__
we have alreadi made progress on thi front __PUNCT__
and i not just talk about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year colleg __PUNCT__ i talk about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year commun colleg __PUNCT__ get advanc train __PUNCT__
but the point is that some form of higher educ __PUNCT__ it is no longer a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure everi young person in america and everi young person in marshalltown can take advantag of those opportun __PUNCT__
that part of what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to repeal obamacar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ i don't mind the term obamacar __PUNCT__
i like it __PUNCT__ becaus i do care __PUNCT__
that why we pass the bill __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and becaus of it __PUNCT__ 6½ million young peopl can stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__
becaus of it __PUNCT__ we got million of senior out there who ar see more discount on their prescript drug and we close the doughnut hole __PUNCT__
becaus of what we do __PUNCT__ more peopl ar get prevent care __PUNCT__
becaus of what we do __PUNCT__ insur compani can't drop you right when you need insur most just becaus of some fine print __PUNCT__
so mayb governor romnei want to spend the next __NUM__ year reargu what we been argu about for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__ we ar implement thi law __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
we ar not go backward __PUNCT__
that is a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
we not go to undo the reform we put into place to make sure wall street doesn't ask for anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout __PUNCT__
we not go to go back to the dai when folk __PUNCT__ to serv thi countri __PUNCT__ it depend on who thei love __PUNCT__
if thei love thi countri __PUNCT__ thei should be abl to serv thi countri __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
we go to make sure that young peopl who ar brought to thi countri when thei were veri young and have grown up as american __PUNCT__ that thei have an opportun to contribut here in america __PUNCT__ the countri that thei love __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
we go forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i have to tell you that over the cours of the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ you will see more monei spent by the other side than we ever seen in histori __PUNCT__
and i don't want to lie __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we rais monei __PUNCT__ but these folk ar write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei got some friend in __PUNCT__ with a lot of monei __PUNCT__
and we ar see all these ad __PUNCT__ and you notic thei don't realli have a plan __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ you don't see these ad sai what thei go to do __PUNCT__ becaus thei know that their plan would not sell __PUNCT__
so instead __PUNCT__ what thei go to do is just repeat over and over again the same thing that thei been sai for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ and that is __PUNCT__ the economi is not do as well as it should and it obama fault __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ that their __PUNCT__ basic __PUNCT__ thei do differ ad __PUNCT__ but it the same theme __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ i might be a littl worri about it except __PUNCT__ what you taught me __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we have been outspent befor __PUNCT__ we have been count out befor __PUNCT__
but what i learn is that when the american peopl cut through the nonsens __PUNCT__ when thei pai attent and thei focus __PUNCT__ and thei think back to their own famili and their parent and their grandpar and everyth that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ when thei decid we go to make sure that we got a govern that is not just repres the power and the wealthi __PUNCT__ but just look after ordinari folk and recogn govern can't solv everi problem and nobodi expect a handout or a bailout __PUNCT__ but we do expect to make sure that togeth we ar do thing that help the next gener __PUNCT__ when the american peopl start focus on those core valu that have made thi countri great __PUNCT__ i tell you what __PUNCT__ you can't be stop __PUNCT__
