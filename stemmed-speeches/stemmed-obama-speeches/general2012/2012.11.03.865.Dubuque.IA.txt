and it not just in the auto industri __PUNCT__
there ar thousand of worker right here in iowa build wind turbin __PUNCT__ all across the countri __PUNCT__ build long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__ advanc manufactur __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that just subsid oil compani profit when thei make monei hand over fist __PUNCT__ i want to support the energi job of futur __PUNCT__ the new technolog that will creat new job and energi independ __PUNCT__ cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__

but if we seriou about reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ not just us it for a talk point dure elect __PUNCT__ if we seriou about it __PUNCT__ then we also got to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the rate thei paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
becaus budget ar about choic __PUNCT__ and if we go to cut back __PUNCT__ let make sure that we not cut back on thing that ar go to help us grow in the futur __PUNCT__
