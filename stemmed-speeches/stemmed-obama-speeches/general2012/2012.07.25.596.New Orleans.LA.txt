now __PUNCT__ thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i term limit __PUNCT__
you onli get two of these __PUNCT__
but it ha made me a littl nostalg __PUNCT__
it make me think about some of my first polit campaign __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
fire up __PUNCT__ readi to go __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when i first start in polit __PUNCT__ i wa a law professor __PUNCT__ i wa practic civil right law __PUNCT__ and then i decid to run for the state senat in my area __PUNCT__
and i didn't have a lot of backup __PUNCT__ so we have to go to kinko and print up flier __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and michel and me and some friend __PUNCT__ we just go knock on door __PUNCT__
and then when i ran for the unit state senat __PUNCT__ illinoi is a big state so we had to drive around all over the place __PUNCT__
but i didn't have marin on or air forc on or a motorcad __PUNCT__
we had me __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ in my car __PUNCT__
i usual have a staff person with me __PUNCT__
and the young peopl __PUNCT__ you wouldn't understand thi __PUNCT__ but back then we had to us these thing call map __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so thei were piec of paper __PUNCT__ and you had to unfold them and try to figur out where you were go __PUNCT__ and then you had to try to figur out how to fold them back __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and we would travel all across the state __PUNCT__ and i go to inner citi and farm town and suburban area __PUNCT__ and you meet peopl from all walk of life __PUNCT__ all incom level __PUNCT__
and what wa interest __PUNCT__ what inspir me __PUNCT__ what made me realiz that thi might be a worthi pursuit wa the sens that wherev i went __PUNCT__ no matter how differ peopl look on the surfac __PUNCT__ there wa a common thread to their stori __PUNCT__
and it connect with my stori __PUNCT__
so if i saw an elderli coupl __PUNCT__ thei remind me of my grandpar __PUNCT__
and i think about my grandfath __PUNCT__ who fought in world war ii and then came home __PUNCT__
my grandmoth __PUNCT__ dure the war __PUNCT__ work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__ like rosi the rivet __PUNCT__
but when my grandfath came back he wa abl to get a colleg educ becaus of the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to bui their first home with the help of an fha loan __PUNCT__
and i think about the journei thei had travel and everyth that that gener had done for america __PUNCT__ but also what america had done for them __PUNCT__
and sometim __PUNCT__ i meet a singl mom __PUNCT__ and i think about my mom __PUNCT__
my dad left __PUNCT__ and i didn't know him __PUNCT__
so my mother didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__
she had to work __PUNCT__ put herself through school __PUNCT__ but with the help of scholarship and grant __PUNCT__ she wa abl to get ahead __PUNCT__ and then she wa abl to pass on a great educ to me and my sister __PUNCT__
and i think about how in america __PUNCT__ unlik a lot of other countri __PUNCT__ she could make someth out of herself even in those circumst __PUNCT__
and then i meet a work coupl __PUNCT__ and i think about michel parent __PUNCT__
her dad __PUNCT__ by the time i met him __PUNCT__ could bare walk __PUNCT__
he had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ so he had to us two cane __PUNCT__ and he had to wake up an hour earli __PUNCT__ earlier than everybodi els becaus that how long it took him just to get dress and get readi and get to the job __PUNCT__
but he didn't miss a dai of work __PUNCT__ becaus he believ in hi respons and look after hi famili __PUNCT__
and michel mom work as a secretari at a bank __PUNCT__
and so thei never had a lot of monei __PUNCT__ but thei had a lot of love __PUNCT__ and thei understood the concept of hard work and respons __PUNCT__ and so thei were abl to pass on an extraordinari life to michel and her brother __PUNCT__
and as i travel around the state of illinoi __PUNCT__ it wa clear to me that my stori wasn't uniqu and the stori of peopl i wa meet weren't uniqu __PUNCT__
it wa the american stori __PUNCT__
it wa thi idea that here in thi countri __PUNCT__ we don't believ in handout __PUNCT__ we don't believ in bailout __PUNCT__ we believ in peopl earn what thei get __PUNCT__
we believ in peopl work hard __PUNCT__ we believ in peopl look after their own famili and take respons and take initi __PUNCT__
but we also believ that in thi countri __PUNCT__ hard work should pai off __PUNCT__ that respons should be reward __PUNCT__
and we believ that in thi countri __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ you should be abl to make it if you try __PUNCT__
that ha been the central notion that built thi countri __PUNCT__
that ha been our hallmark __PUNCT__
that been the core idea that drove america __PUNCT__ thi idea that in thi countri __PUNCT__ you can get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ and so if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
and that what creat thi econom superpow __PUNCT__ and that what creat the greatest and largest middl class in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ when i wa first run for presid __PUNCT__ we came togeth and a lot of you support me in that race becaus we believ in those valu and we believ in those idea __PUNCT__ and we had seen that __PUNCT__ for almost a decad __PUNCT__ that idea that had built america middl class seem as if it wa slip awai __PUNCT__
we had gone through a decad in which hard work wasn't alwai reward __PUNCT__
middl class folk saw their incom actual go down __PUNCT__
so while their paycheck ar shrink __PUNCT__ the cost of everyth from health care to a colleg educ kept on go up __PUNCT__
a few peopl were do realli well __PUNCT__ but the vast major wa struggl __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ in washington __PUNCT__ we financ two war on a credit card __PUNCT__ turn a surplu into a deficit __PUNCT__
and becaus nobodi wa make sure that folk on wall street were do what thei were suppos to be do __PUNCT__ all thi culmin in the worst financi crisi and the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__
we didn't know all that when i start to run __PUNCT__
but what we understood wa __PUNCT__ what we were fight for wa the kind of chang that would onc again make real thi idea that if you work hard you be reward and you can get ahead __PUNCT__
we were fight for polici that would grow the middl class and provid them with that sens of secur __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ it not just a matter of how much monei you have in your bank account when we talk about be middl class __PUNCT__
it the idea that if you work hard you can find a job that support your famili and you can mayb get a home you call your own and you not go to go bankrupt if you get sick __PUNCT__
you go to be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ that your kid and your grandkid can do even better than you did __PUNCT__ that thei can achiev what you didn't even imagin __PUNCT__
for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ everyth i have done as presid ha been focus on that principl __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ as we saw thi econom crisi unfold __PUNCT__ we understood that the chang we believ in would take more than on year __PUNCT__ more than on term __PUNCT__ and probabl take more than on presid __PUNCT__
but over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we start to steer thing in the right direct __PUNCT__
we were lose __NUM__ job a month when i wa sworn in __PUNCT__
now we seen more than __NUM__ year of job growth everi singl month __PUNCT__ more than 4½ million new job __PUNCT__
an auto industri on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ we made sure that we bet on american worker and american manufactur __PUNCT__
and it come roar back __PUNCT__
we move to make sure that colleg wa more afford for young peopl and that more american had access to health care __PUNCT__
and so over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ everyth we done ha been focus on how do we creat an economi that is built to last __PUNCT__ that not built on specul __PUNCT__ that doesn't just benefit the few __PUNCT__ but that consist build the middl class so that thei can achiev their dream __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ for all the work that we done __PUNCT__ we know we got more work to do __PUNCT__ becaus there ar still million of peopl out there out of work __PUNCT__
too mani peopl still have home whose valu have drop becaus of thi hous bubbl burst __PUNCT__
so we understand that we got more work to do __PUNCT__
but sometim __PUNCT__ particularli dure polit season __PUNCT__ when i hear cynic who sai that our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ i tell them __PUNCT__ you don't know the american peopl __PUNCT__
you don't know their grit __PUNCT__ and you don't know their determin __PUNCT__
you haven't met the small __PUNCT__ busi owner who decid to keep everybodi on payrol __PUNCT__ even if thei couldn't pai themselv __PUNCT__ becaus thei believ in do the right thing __PUNCT__
you haven't talk to some of these autowork in these plant that folk thought would never build anoth car again and now can't build them fast enough __PUNCT__
you haven't met folk who __PUNCT__ at the ag of __NUM__ or __NUM__ went back to commun colleg __PUNCT__ sit next to a bunch of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ becaus thei believ in retrain themselv and now ar find job in biotechnolog or clean energi __PUNCT__
when you travel around thi countri __PUNCT__ you understand that the american peopl ar tougher than ani tough time __PUNCT__
and although there ar no quick fix or easi solut __PUNCT__ there no doubt that we can solv everi challeng that we face __PUNCT__
what hold us back right now is not the lack of solut __PUNCT__
what hold us back is a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
what hold us back is a few folk who sai __PUNCT__ we ar go to take the uncompromis view that the onli path forward is to go back to what we were do that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__ the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that we ar now debat in thi campaign __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me be specif here __PUNCT__
thi afternoon the senat pass a bill that sai if you earn __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ your tax should not go up next year __PUNCT__
thi is someth i deepli believ in __PUNCT__ becaus the middl class is still struggl __PUNCT__ recov from thi recess __PUNCT__
you don't need your tax to go up __PUNCT__ and we could give you certainti right now __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ we deal with washington __PUNCT__
so republican in the hous __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ we go to hold the middl class tax cut hostag unless thei get anoth trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of tax cut for the wealthiest __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ thi make no sens __PUNCT__
if congress doesn't act __PUNCT__ the typic middl class famili is go to see their tax bill go up about __MONEY__
small busi will also see their tax go up __PUNCT__
so i call on the hous republican to drop their demand for anoth trillion __PUNCT__ dollar giveawai for millionair and billionair so that we can make sure that middl class famili and small busi have the financi secur and certainti that thei need __PUNCT__
but so far thei don't see it that wai __PUNCT__
governor romnei doesn't see it that wai __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus thei got a fundament differ vision about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
thei believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
their plan is to cut more tax for the wealthi __PUNCT__ cut more regul on bank and corpor __PUNCT__ cut more invest in thing like educ __PUNCT__ job train __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ research __PUNCT__ all with the thought that somehow that go to help us creat job __PUNCT__
that what mitt romnei believ __PUNCT__
that what washington republican believ __PUNCT__
i think thei wrong __PUNCT__
that not what i believ __PUNCT__
that not what you believ __PUNCT__
that not what most american believ __PUNCT__
we believ not in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ we believ in middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__
we believ in bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that what i have fought for for 3½ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so the good thing is you got the power to break thi stalem __PUNCT__
but you need to understand there ar two fundament differ vision about how we move forward __PUNCT__
there a real choic __PUNCT__
i believ that hard work should be reward __PUNCT__ and i believ that although all of us have to take individu initi __PUNCT__ there ar also some thing that we have to do togeth as a countri to make sure that we grow __PUNCT__
i don't believ that tax cut for folk like me who don't need them and weren't even ask for them is go to grow the economi __PUNCT__
but i do think that if we invest in outstand educ for everi child in new orlean and everi child across america __PUNCT__ that will help grow the economi __PUNCT__
so what i said is let help local school district hire the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
let help folk go to __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million more peopl go to commun colleg so that thei can retrain for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
let make sure __PUNCT__ build off the work we alreadi done to expand pell grant and to provid tuition tax credit for middl class famili __PUNCT__ let make sure that colleg tuition goe down instead of up __PUNCT__
becaus in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it an econom necess that everybodi should have access to __PUNCT__
that on of the reason i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ to make sure everybodi get a great educ __PUNCT__
here anoth differ __PUNCT__ i don't believ in give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that invest right here in new orlean __PUNCT__ right here in louisiana __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker to make american product to sell around the world __PUNCT__ stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi campaign __PUNCT__
my oppon got differ idea __PUNCT__
he sai he qualifi to turn around the economi becaus of all hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__
turn out that experi is invest in compani that have been call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
i don't believ in be a pioneer in outsourc __PUNCT__
i want some insourc __PUNCT__
i want to bring job back to the unit state __PUNCT__ not send them someplac els __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ i said i would end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
thank to the extraordinari servic of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ not onli have we given iraqi an opportun to determin their own destini __PUNCT__ but we were abl to refocu our attent on al qaida __PUNCT__ the folk who actual carri out the 9/11 attack __PUNCT__
so we got them on their heel and decim their leadership __PUNCT__ includ usama bin laden __PUNCT__
and if __PUNCT__ and now in afghanistan we start to transit and bring our troop home so that afghan can take a lead for secur their own countri __PUNCT__
so after almost a decad of war __PUNCT__ i think it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
i want to take half the monei that we ar save and put peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and port and new school __PUNCT__
that good for the construct industri __PUNCT__ it good for the construct worker __PUNCT__ but it also mean that those folk have some monei in their pocket and thei can come down to new orlean and spend some of that monei and help thi local economi __PUNCT__
and it lai the foundat for econom growth for decad to come __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei ha got differ idea __PUNCT__
and we tri those idea __PUNCT__ and thei didn't work __PUNCT__
i believ that we did the right thing in provid health care to everi american __PUNCT__
i don't think you should go bankrupt becaus you got sick __PUNCT__
i don't believ that children should not be abl to get health insur becaus of a preexist condit __PUNCT__
i think we did the right thing to make sure that young peopl could stai on their parent plan until thei __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i think we did the right thing to make sure that senior have lower prescript drug cost __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar go to implement thi law __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
we not go back to the dai when you had to scrambl and try to figur out how you were go to care for your love on if thei got sick __PUNCT__
we not go to go back to the dai when whether you could serv the countri you love depend on who you love __PUNCT__
we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we not go back __PUNCT__
we pass the lilli ledbett act to make sure that women got equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__ becaus i got two daughter and think that thei should be treat just like somebodi els son __PUNCT__
and we not go to go back to the dai when women did not have control of their health care choic __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__ we not go backward __PUNCT__
on almost everi issu there is a choic __PUNCT__
and you see it in term of how we deal with the deficit __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ the deficit a real problem __PUNCT__
we got to reduc it __PUNCT__
i inherit a big deficit __PUNCT__ and we got to now bring it down __PUNCT__
but we can't bring it down just on the back of the poor __PUNCT__
we can't bring it down on the back of the middl class __PUNCT__
we can't bring it down in a wai that prevent us from make invest in the futur __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we alreadi cut a trillion dollar in program that we don't need __PUNCT__ and i will to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__ but i not go to do more if we not ask folk who have been most bless by thi countri __PUNCT__ like me __PUNCT__ to just pai a littl bit more in tax __PUNCT__ to go back to the rate that exist under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we tri that __PUNCT__ and that work __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ surplu instead of deficit __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ new orlean __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__
we creat a lot of millionair then too __PUNCT__
becaus what happen is when peopl in the middl and at the bottom have a chanc and ar do well __PUNCT__ then lo and behold __PUNCT__ folk at the top got more custom __PUNCT__
everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
everybodi benefit __PUNCT__
we all grow __PUNCT__
so those ar the choic that we have in thi elect __PUNCT__ and you go to be the tiebreak __PUNCT__
you will break the stalem __PUNCT__
i got to tell you __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month you ar go to hear a lot of stuff __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that what it is __PUNCT__ stuff __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and sometim thei will plai around with thing i sai __PUNCT__
thei take out whole sentenc __PUNCT__
thei got an ad right now where thei just splice it and dice it __PUNCT__ make it seem like i don't appreci the incred work of small __PUNCT__ businesspeopl __PUNCT__
and i sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ everyth i done over the last 3½ year ha been focus on how do we creat greater opportun for entrepreneur and small __PUNCT__ businesspeopl __PUNCT__ cut their tax __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
i understand the sacrific and the sweat and the tear that thei put in __PUNCT__
but that not go to be how it present becaus that the natur of polit these dai __PUNCT__
we go to see more monei spent on neg ad than we ever seen befor __PUNCT__
you got folk write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
and the messag in all these ad is go to be the same __PUNCT__
there will be variat on it __PUNCT__ but it all go to be the same messag __PUNCT__ which basic is __PUNCT__ the economi is still struggl __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
it a veri succinct messag __PUNCT__
and the reason that that their messag is becaus thei know that their actual idea won't sell __PUNCT__ that their approach is not on that go to work and the american peopl have reject in the past __PUNCT__
so all thei can do is try to argu that just by get rid of me __PUNCT__ somehow everyth is go to be solv __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ when folk who ar write __MONEY__ million check ar go after you __PUNCT__ you think about it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ you think about it __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__
the reason i stand befor you feel good and feel confid about america futur __PUNCT__ not just about thi elect __PUNCT__ is becaus i been the underdog befor __PUNCT__ i been count out befor __PUNCT__ i been outspent befor __PUNCT__
but what i learn in those veri first campaign __PUNCT__ and ha been confirm for me ever sinc __PUNCT__ is that when the american peopl realli start focus and pai attent __PUNCT__ when thei start cut through the nonsens __PUNCT__ when thei start listen to what folk actual have to sai __PUNCT__ and when the american peopl start reflect on their own live __PUNCT__ thei think about their parent and their grandpar and their great __PUNCT__ grandpar and the stori of how some of them mayb came to thi countri as immigr __PUNCT__ some came in chain __PUNCT__ but all of those forebear of our understood there wa someth about thi countri where we could make it __PUNCT__
it might be hard sometim __PUNCT__
there might be time where we have setback __PUNCT__
but if we appli ourselv __PUNCT__ we could pass on a better america to the next gener __PUNCT__
that idea __PUNCT__ that idea that led me into polit __PUNCT__ that idea that is true for all of our famili __PUNCT__ when we focu on that idea __PUNCT__ when we rememb that we rise or fall togeth as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__ when that idea come to the fore __PUNCT__ the american peopl can't be stop __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter how mani neg ad ar out there __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter how much monei is spent __PUNCT__
chang happen when the american peopl ar focus on those thing that ar best in us __PUNCT__
and so over these next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ i will be carri your stori with me __PUNCT__ and it will give me confid __PUNCT__ and it will give me inspir __PUNCT__ just like it did in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and i have to tell you __PUNCT__ new orlean __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ i tri to not make promis that i couldn't keep __PUNCT__
so i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i kept that promis __PUNCT__
i said i cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__ averag famili __PUNCT__ tax ar __MONEY__ lower than when i came into offic __PUNCT__
kept that promis __PUNCT__
on of the other promis i kept wa i said __PUNCT__ you know i not a perfect man __PUNCT__ michel will tell you that __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i won't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__ but what i can promis is that i alwai tell you what i think and i alwai tell you where i stand and __PUNCT__ most importantli __PUNCT__ i will wake up everi morn and fight as hard as i know how for you __PUNCT__
becaus i see myself in you __PUNCT__
in your grandpar __PUNCT__ i see my grandpar __PUNCT__
in your children __PUNCT__ i see malia and sasha __PUNCT__
i see my own stori in your stori __PUNCT__
and so i kept that promis __PUNCT__ new orlean __PUNCT__
i been fight for you __PUNCT__
i believ in you __PUNCT__
and if you still believ in me and you will to stand with me and fight with me and organ with me and make phone call with me and knock on door with me __PUNCT__ if you see what i see __PUNCT__ a bold __PUNCT__ gener __PUNCT__ optimist america where all peopl have a fair shot at success and everybodi is do their fair share __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ we will finish what we start and we will remind the world just why it is that the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
