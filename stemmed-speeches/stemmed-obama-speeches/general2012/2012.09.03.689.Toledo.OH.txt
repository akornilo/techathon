and when governor romnei had hi chanc to let you in on the secret sauc of job creation __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he did not offer you a singl new idea __PUNCT__
it wa just a retread of the same old polici that have been stick it to the middl class for year __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ after the convent __PUNCT__ governor romnei came here to ohio __PUNCT__ and he said he go to be the coach that lead america to a __PUNCT__ win season __PUNCT__
the problem is everybodi ha alreadi seen hi econom playbook __PUNCT__

john kasich stood up there and told everybodi that ohio is now number on in the midwest in job creation __PUNCT__ fourth best in america __PUNCT__ which got folk kind of confus __PUNCT__ becaus if it all obama fault and noth is go right __PUNCT__ what go on in ohio __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ i guess the theori wa that it all the governor do __PUNCT__
but i think we need to refresh hi memori __PUNCT__ becaus a lot of those job ar autowork job like your __PUNCT__
the american auto industri support on in eight job in thi state __PUNCT__
and just a few year ago __PUNCT__ when the auto industri wa flatlin __PUNCT__ what wa in hi and governor romnei playbook __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
you rememb that __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ think about what that would have meant not just for ohio __PUNCT__ but for america __PUNCT__
if we had turn our back on you __PUNCT__ if america had thrown in the towel like that __PUNCT__ gm and chrysler wouldn't exist todai __PUNCT__
the supplier and the distributor that get their busi from these compani would have di off __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
then even ford could have gone down as well __PUNCT__
product shut down __PUNCT__
factori shutter __PUNCT__
onc proud compani chop up and sold off in scrap __PUNCT__
and all of you __PUNCT__ the men and women who built these compani with your own hand __PUNCT__ you would have been bench for good __PUNCT__
that not a good plai __PUNCT__
we didn't run that plai __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ million american across the countri would have lost their job in the middl of the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
in commun across the midwest __PUNCT__ it would have been anoth great depress __PUNCT__
and it not just the worker themselv __PUNCT__ think about everybodi who depend on you __PUNCT__ schoolteach __PUNCT__ small __PUNCT__ busi owner __PUNCT__ the server in the diner who know your order befor you walk in __PUNCT__ the bartend who know your order befor you walk in __PUNCT__
their livelihood were at stake as well __PUNCT__ and so wa someth els __PUNCT__
how mani autowork here work the assembl line __PUNCT__ but your dad and your granddad __PUNCT__ mayb your mom __PUNCT__ grandma work on that same line __PUNCT__ how mani peopl ar second or third or fourth gener __PUNCT__ how mani of you have son and daughter who hope to work on those same assembl line __PUNCT__ these job ar worth more than just a paycheck __PUNCT__
thei a sourc of pride __PUNCT__
thei a ticket into a middl class life __PUNCT__
these compani ar worth more than just the car that thei build __PUNCT__
thei a symbol of america innov __PUNCT__
thei a sourc of our manufactur might __PUNCT__
if that is not worth fight for __PUNCT__ then what is __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ we not about to take a knee and do noth __PUNCT__
we weren't go to give up on your job and your famili and your commun __PUNCT__
we weren't go to let detroit go bankrupt or lordstown go bankrupt or toledo go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i stood with american worker __PUNCT__
i stood with american manufactur __PUNCT__
i believ in you __PUNCT__
i bet on you __PUNCT__
i make that bet ani dai of the week __PUNCT__
and becaus of that bet __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ that bet is pai off for america __PUNCT__
three year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
so it a littl funni watch governor romnei and governor kasich and other just try to rewrit histori now that you back on your feet __PUNCT__
these ar the folk who said __PUNCT__ if we went forward with our plan __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ i quot here __PUNCT__ you can kiss the american automot industri goodby __PUNCT__
now thei sai it wa their idea all along __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ serious __PUNCT__
or what thei sai is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the problem is that you __PUNCT__ the worker __PUNCT__ made out like bandit in thi whole thing __PUNCT__ that we did what we did becaus it wa all about pai back union __PUNCT__
realli __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ even by the standard of polit campaign __PUNCT__ that a lot of you know what __PUNCT__
worker made some of the biggest sacrific __PUNCT__
about __NUM__ retire saw a reduct in the health benefit thei had earn __PUNCT__
hour were reduc __PUNCT__ pai and wage scale back __PUNCT__
you gave up promis made to you over the year for the sake and the surviv of your fellow worker and their famili and the compani __PUNCT__
you made sacrific __PUNCT__
which is why i don't understand why these folk have the nerv to talk about you like you some greedi special interest that need to be beaten down __PUNCT__
after all that union have done to build and protect the middl class __PUNCT__ thei were stand up there at their convent sai you respons for the problem we face __PUNCT__
their plan sai the best wai to help worker is to roll back worker __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ to overturn law that make sure construct worker get a fair wage __PUNCT__ to blame teacher and firefight and polic offic and other public servant for our econom challeng instead of what happen on wall street and a histor financi collaps __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ toledo __PUNCT__ what you need to know is thi __PUNCT__ when thei try to take your collect bargain right awai __PUNCT__ when thei try to pass so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ right to work __PUNCT__ law that realli mean right to work for less and less __PUNCT__ you should know thi isn't about econom __PUNCT__
thi is about polit __PUNCT__
thi notion that we should have let the auto industri die and that we should pursu antiwork polici in the hope that union like your will unravel __PUNCT__ it part of the same old you __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ your __PUNCT__ own __PUNCT__ top __PUNCT__ down philosophi that sai we should just leav everybodi to fend for themselv __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on thursdai night __PUNCT__ i go to offer you what i believ is a better path forward __PUNCT__ a path that go to grow thi economi and creat more good job and strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__
and the good new is __PUNCT__ start on __DATE__ ohio get it sai becaus you get to vote earli __PUNCT__

or you can choos my plan __PUNCT__ to keep tax low for everi american who is in the middl class and everi american who is strive to get into that middl class __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut tax by a total __PUNCT__ for middl class famili __PUNCT__ and i have cut tax by a total of about __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
and now i run to make sure that tax aren't rais a singl dime on the first __MONEY__ of ani famili incom __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
it mai be __NUM__ percent of thi auditorium __PUNCT__
your tax won't go up __PUNCT__ becaus my belief is you need relief __PUNCT__
i don't need relief __PUNCT__
mitt romnei doesn't need relief __PUNCT__
he need it less than me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
you can choos whether we give up new job and new industri to countri like china __PUNCT__ or whether we fight to keep those job in state like ohio __PUNCT__
unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to give those tax break to compani that ar invest right here in toledo __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state __PUNCT__ all across ohio __PUNCT__ all across the midwest __PUNCT__
you can decid whether borrow monei from your parent is an answer when a young person ask how thei go to go to colleg __PUNCT__
you heard about that __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ thi young colleg student sai __PUNCT__ how can i get some help go to colleg __PUNCT__ he sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you need to borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ i guess that on path __PUNCT__
that on approach __PUNCT__
i got a differ approach that sai let make sure american onc again lead the world in educ our kid and train our worker for the job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
and that mean let hire more great teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
let help more folk go to commun colleg to get train in the skill that employ ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
becaus the truth is __PUNCT__ some sort of higher educ __PUNCT__ whether it __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year or a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year technic school __PUNCT__ some form of higher educ __PUNCT__ that not a luxuri anymor __PUNCT__
that is an econom necess that everi famili should be abl to afford __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ you can choos an energi plan like the other gui is offer that written by and for the oil compani __PUNCT__
or you can choos an all __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ abov strategi for american energi __PUNCT__ which mean we drill for more oil __PUNCT__ we mine for more coal __PUNCT__
but it also mean that we go after the new energi sourc of the futur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon said renew energi sourc ar imaginari __PUNCT__
the folk here in toledo manufactur solar panel might disagre with that __PUNCT__
these job aren't a fad __PUNCT__ thei not imaginari __PUNCT__
thei our futur __PUNCT__
and unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i want to stop give a __MONEY__ billion a year taxpay subsidi to big oil compani that ar make monei everi time you go to the pump and i want to us that monei to invest in homegrown energi sourc that have never been more promis and ar creat job right here in ohio __PUNCT__
it up to you whether we go back to the old health care system that let insur compani decid when to cover you and when to cover you and drop you when you need it most __PUNCT__
but i think we should keep move forward with the new health care law that alreadi cut cost and cover more peopl and save live __PUNCT__
thei call it obamacar __PUNCT__
it true __PUNCT__ i care __PUNCT__
it true __PUNCT__
i guess the other side plan is the __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ doesn't __PUNCT__ care __PUNCT__ plan __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but now is not the time to refight the battl of the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we need to move forward __PUNCT__
you get to decid what the futur of the war in afghanistan is __PUNCT__

i said we end that war __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we go after al qaida __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__

our troop ar out of iraq __PUNCT__
we bring them home from afghanistan __PUNCT__
and as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will serv our veteran as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
