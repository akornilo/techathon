i honestli believ thi is the clearest choic of ani time in a gener __PUNCT__
it not just between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__ but it is a choic between two fundament differ vision for how we move forward as a countri __PUNCT__
and our vision __PUNCT__ our fight is for that basic bargain that built the greatest middl class on earth and the strongest economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
it a bargain that sai __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ that hard work will pai off __PUNCT__ that respons will be reward __PUNCT__ that everybodi should get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi should do their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi should plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from main street to wall street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i ran for presid becaus i saw that basic bargain erod __PUNCT__ too mani job get ship oversea __PUNCT__ too mani famili who were struggl with the cost of everyth from groceri to ga to colleg to health care __PUNCT__ rack up more and more debt just to keep up with expens becaus paycheck weren't go up the wai cost were __PUNCT__
and then becaus of that debt __PUNCT__ it made thing that much harder __PUNCT__
and when that hous of card collaps in the worst recess sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ we saw million of american lose their job __PUNCT__ home __PUNCT__ life save __PUNCT__

but thei happi to talk about what wrong __PUNCT__
thei don't do much to tell you what thei go to do to make it right __PUNCT__
thei want your vote __PUNCT__ but thei don't want to tell you their plan __PUNCT__

small busi __PUNCT__ i cut tax __NUM__ separ time __PUNCT__

i sure don't believ fire teacher or kick student off of financi aid will help grow our economi or compet with countri like china that ar produc engin and scientist __PUNCT__
after all that we been through __PUNCT__ doe anybodi actual believ that roll back regul on wall street ar somehow go to help the small businesswoman in cincinnati expand or the construct worker who been laid off __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ we have been there __PUNCT__ we have tri that __PUNCT__

we not go to tell folk that you on your own __PUNCT__ becaus we believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we don't think the economi grow from the top down __PUNCT__ we think it grow from the middl out __PUNCT__ from a strong middl class __PUNCT__ from strong work famili __PUNCT__
when peopl ar do well in the middl __PUNCT__ then everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
what happen when you got a littl more monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

and that mean busi have more custom __PUNCT__
that mean thei make more profit __PUNCT__ and then thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
and we get a virtuou cycl __PUNCT__ go up __PUNCT__ go forward __PUNCT__
we ar not go backward __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
that what thi elect about __PUNCT__
and i want you to know __PUNCT__ cincinnati __PUNCT__ i have never promis that the path we on is go to be quick or easi __PUNCT__
as bill clinton remind us at the convent __PUNCT__ it go to take more than a few year to solv challeng that have built up over decad __PUNCT__
but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ i know we will get there __PUNCT__
when i hear some of these folk in the other parti talk about a nation in declin __PUNCT__ thei ar dead wrong __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur and the best busi in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
there not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
our problem can be solv __PUNCT__ and our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
the path we offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
and i ask you to choos that futur __PUNCT__
i ask you to ralli around a set of goal to creat new manufactur job here in ohio __PUNCT__ to build on what we alreadi done to creat a new energi strategi for america __PUNCT__ build on what we alreadi done to improv educ and bring down our deficit __PUNCT__ turn the page on a decad of war __PUNCT__
that what we can do in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ cincinnati __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i want everybodi to be clear __PUNCT__ the goal we set ar concret __PUNCT__ and thei ar achiev __PUNCT__
the first part of the plan is to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ thi countri ha now creat over half a million new manufactur job in the last 2Â½ year __PUNCT__ a whole lot of them here in ohio __PUNCT__
when some of these other folk said we should let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ when thei said we should walk awai from an industri that support on in eight job in ohio __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ we not go to go that wai __PUNCT__
i bet on american worker __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back with nearli __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can give more tax break to corpor that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ or we can start reward corpor and compani that ar open new plant and train new worker and creat new job right here in ohio __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
right here __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i understand my oppon been run around ohio claim __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__

he made monei invest in compani that uproot from here and went to china __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ you can't stand up to china when all you done is send them our job __PUNCT__
you can talk a good game __PUNCT__ but i like to walk the walk __PUNCT__ not just talk the talk __PUNCT__
and my experi ha been wake up everi singl dai and do everyth i can to make sure american worker get a fair shot in the global economi __PUNCT__
when other countri don't plai by the rule __PUNCT__ we done someth about it __PUNCT__
we brought more trade case against china in on term than the previou administr did in two __PUNCT__
and everi case we brought that been decid __PUNCT__ we won __PUNCT__
when governor romnei said that stop unfair surg in chines tire would be bad for america __PUNCT__ bad for our worker __PUNCT__ we ignor hi advic __PUNCT__ and we got over a thousand american back to work creat tire right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
earlier thi year __PUNCT__ i set up a new task forc to aggress go after unfair trade practic that harm our worker __PUNCT__ and it alreadi deliv __PUNCT__
two month ago __PUNCT__ we move to hold china account for unfair trade practic that harm american automak __PUNCT__
todai my administr launch a new action against china __PUNCT__ thi on against illeg subsidi that encourag compani to ship auto part manufactur job oversea __PUNCT__
these ar subsidi that directli harm work men and women on the assembl line in ohio and michigan and across the midwest __PUNCT__
your senat __PUNCT__ sherrod brown __PUNCT__ ha fought as hard as anybodi to stop thi __PUNCT__
and we ar go to stop it __PUNCT__
it is not right __PUNCT__ it is against the rule __PUNCT__ and we will not let it stand __PUNCT__
american worker build better product than anybodi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ mean someth __PUNCT__
like andrew said __PUNCT__ when the plai field is level __PUNCT__ america will alwai win __PUNCT__
but what we need is folk who actual walk the walk __PUNCT__ not just talk the talk __PUNCT__
we don't need folk who dure elect time suddenli ar worri about trade practic __PUNCT__ but befor the elect ar take advantag of unfair trade practic __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ if you stand with me __PUNCT__ if you choos the path we talk about __PUNCT__ we go to help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
and we sell more good around the world stamp with __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ and we creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__ but i need your help to move forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that not all we go to have to do to rebuild our economi __PUNCT__
we got to train our worker to fill good job __PUNCT__
that why the second part of my plan is to give more american the chanc to earn the skill that thei need to compet __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ educ wa the gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai of opportun for michel __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai of opportun for a lot of you __PUNCT__
andrew __PUNCT__ right now he studi to get hi degre with some help from pell grant that we expand __PUNCT__ becaus he understand that even though he do well now __PUNCT__ we constantli got to build up our skill __PUNCT__
it the gatewai to a middl class life __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ million of student ar pai less for colleg becaus we final took on a system that wast billion of taxpay dollar us bank and lender as middlemen __PUNCT__
we said let give the monei directli to student __PUNCT__ and we been abl to help million of more young peopl get an educ __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ you look at their budget __PUNCT__ thei propos to gut educ just to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
that on path __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i offer a differ path __PUNCT__
we can decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom or a crumbl school __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei can't afford it __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find ani with the right skill here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ cincinnati __PUNCT__ i ask you to help me recruit a hundr thousand new math and scienc teacher in the next __NUM__ year and improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
let help give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn the skill thei need at commun colleg that will lead directli to a job __PUNCT__
let work with colleg and univers to keep tuition down __PUNCT__ to cut in half the tuition cost over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can meet those goal togeth __PUNCT__
that the futur we can choos __PUNCT__
third thing __PUNCT__ i got a plan to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel effici standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will get twice __PUNCT__ will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__
that help our nation secur __PUNCT__ and it help our environ __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi we gener from wind and solar __PUNCT__ and thousand of american __PUNCT__ includ here in ohio __PUNCT__ have job todai build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
we ar less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you got a choic between a plan that revers thi progress or on that build on it __PUNCT__
becaus as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
and i not go to let them keep on collect __MONEY__ billion in taxpay __PUNCT__ fund corpor welfar __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__
we keep on invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
we invest to help farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and our truck __PUNCT__
let put some construct worker back to work rebuild our home and our factori so thei wast less energi __PUNCT__
and we got to develop a nearli hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
we can do it in a wai that safe __PUNCT__
and if you choos thi path __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and we can support about __NUM__ new job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
that a plan for the futur __PUNCT__
it not a plan look backward __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ we go to reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
i put forward a plan that will reduc our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
you don't have to take my word for it __PUNCT__ independ analysi __PUNCT__ thei look at it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we believ you __PUNCT__ it okai __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i appreci that __PUNCT__
but just in case you skeptic __PUNCT__ we actual got real number behind it __PUNCT__
i work with republican in congress to alreadi cut __MONEY__ trillion in spend __PUNCT__
and we will to do more __PUNCT__
i don't want a govern that wast monei __PUNCT__
it got to be lean __PUNCT__ it got to be mean __PUNCT__
it got to make sure that it focus on the peopl that ar work hard __PUNCT__ but need a ladder up __PUNCT__
it got to be focus on do the thing that help us grow __PUNCT__
and there ar program that don't work __PUNCT__ and we got to admit that __PUNCT__
i want to reform the tax code so it simpl and it fair __PUNCT__
i actual done my own tax __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i don't know about some of these other folk __PUNCT__ but i done them __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ so it __PUNCT__ so i know we can make a __PUNCT__ it more simpl and more fair __PUNCT__
but i also think we got to ask the wealthiest household to pai a littl bit more on incom over __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ the same rate we had when the economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and we help a lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
rememb why __PUNCT__
becaus if we help middl class famili __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ you go to spend the monei __PUNCT__ middl out __PUNCT__ not top down __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ my oppon ha a plan too when it come to tax __PUNCT__
but as presid clinton point out __PUNCT__ there on thing miss from it __PUNCT__ arithmet __PUNCT__
arithmet __PUNCT__
thei talk about __PUNCT__ thei sai the most import thing we have to do is reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ that what thei sai __PUNCT__
then the first thing thei do is to spend trillion dollar more on tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__ not just the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion more __PUNCT__
so thei must have skip math class when thei were in school __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ becaus that math doe not add up __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and whenev you ask them to explain the plan __PUNCT__ thei won't __PUNCT__
thei won't sai how thei pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut __PUNCT__
understand how much __MONEY__ trillion is __PUNCT__
i know sometim thi monei __PUNCT__ billion __PUNCT__ trillion __PUNCT__ it get all mix up __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ five trillion dollar over __NUM__ year mean __MONEY__ billion everi year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ billion is about the amount of our entir defens budget __PUNCT__ everyth we spend on our militari __PUNCT__
everyth __PUNCT__ troop __PUNCT__ plane __PUNCT__ carrier __PUNCT__ it about __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
so thei sai thei go to give a tax cut equival to our entir defens budget everi singl year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but thei can't tell you how thei go to pai for it __PUNCT__
and the truth is thei can't pai for it without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
but then thei __PUNCT__ on top of that __PUNCT__ thei want to spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion in new militari spend __PUNCT__ thei sai __PUNCT__ without ad to the deficit __PUNCT__
but thei don't tell you how thei go to do that __PUNCT__
the onli thing thei can do is to keep try to bluff their wai through until __DATE__ and hope that you won't call them on it __PUNCT__
but understand __PUNCT__ cincinnati __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i want to work with them to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
i said if the republican need more love __PUNCT__ if thei want me to walk the dog or __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ wash their car __PUNCT__ i happi to do it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i genuin believ that most american __PUNCT__ democrat or republican __PUNCT__ thei just want us to solv problem __PUNCT__
so i readi and will to work __PUNCT__
but i refus to ask middl class famili to pai over __MONEY__ more so that millionair and billionair can pai less __PUNCT__
i refus to cut clean energi invest and put __NUM__ clean energi job here in ohio at risk just to give me a tax cut or romnei a tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask more than __NUM__ ohio student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__ just to pai for a tax cut for wealthi folk who don't need it __PUNCT__
and i will never turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
folk who have work hard their whole live __PUNCT__ thei shouldn't be spend their golden year at the merci of an insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ we got to reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we go to do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by dump the cost onto senior __PUNCT__
same thing with social secur __PUNCT__
