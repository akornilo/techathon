audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and the reason for that is becaus the choic that we face thi __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__ could not be more signific __PUNCT__
in some wai __PUNCT__ it more import than __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi is not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
thi is a choic about two fundament differ vision for america __PUNCT__ two fundament differ path for our futur __PUNCT__
and here the good new __PUNCT__ you choos the direct __PUNCT__
you ar the tie breaker __PUNCT__
you will decid the direct that we go in not just __PUNCT__ when you walk into that vote booth __PUNCT__ it won't just be for next year or the year after that __PUNCT__
you be make decis that will have an impact on our kid and our grandkid for year to come __PUNCT__ for decad to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ as democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and some republican __PUNCT__ to restor that basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__ what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__ what made us the most prosper economi that the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and it is a simpl bargain __PUNCT__ it a simpl deal __PUNCT__ a simpl credo __PUNCT__
it sai that if you work hard __PUNCT__ your work should be reward __PUNCT__
it a deal that sai __PUNCT__ if you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you should be abl to afford a job __PUNCT__ you should be abl to afford a home that you call your own __PUNCT__
you should be abl to count on health care if you get sick and retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ you should be abl to give your kid an educ that allow them to dream even bigger than you did and do even better than you ever imagin __PUNCT__
it a simpl idea __PUNCT__
it the basic american promis __PUNCT__
and we knew that restor it wasn't go to be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it would take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ we had gone through a decad of sluggish job growth and job be ship oversea and go from surplus to deficit __PUNCT__ all culmin in a financi crisi on wall street __PUNCT__
so we understood it wa go to take some time to deal with challeng that didn't happen overnight __PUNCT__
and that wa even befor the middl class wa hammer by the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ a crisi that rob too mani of our friend and neighbor of job and their home and their save and push the american dream even further out of reach for too mani work famili __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ i have taken strength from you __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__
becaus i seen your resili __PUNCT__ i seen folk get knock down and get right back up __PUNCT__
you ar tougher than tough time __PUNCT__
and that is the reason why we been abl to see 4½ million job creat __PUNCT__
that why we been abl to see the hous market just bare __PUNCT__ slowli start to tick back up __PUNCT__
that the reason that we seen the auto industri come all the wai back __PUNCT__
it becaus of you __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ there on thing that the crisi did not chang __PUNCT__
it did not chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it ha not chang our fundament charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what made us great __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang how we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it onli made us more determin to make sure that america is do right by everyon __PUNCT__ that our prosper is broadli base and broadli share __PUNCT__
and we here to build an economi in which work pai off __PUNCT__ so that no matter who you ar or what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar no quick fix or easi solut to our challeng __PUNCT__
but let me sai thi __PUNCT__
we know what we need to do __PUNCT__
there ar no challeng that ar not within our power to solv __PUNCT__
we got the capac to meet ani challeng __PUNCT__
we have the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best research __PUNCT__ the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__
we a young nation __PUNCT__ we still a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu that come from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
nobodi know that better than florida __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay tell us __PUNCT__ no matter how dark the other side tri to paint the situat __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that would not gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so i want you all to understand __PUNCT__ we can solv our problem __PUNCT__ and we made signific stride on a whole rang of area __PUNCT__
but what stand in our wai still is our polit __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai is a group of folk in washington with some uncompromis view __PUNCT__ folk who believ that the onli wai we can get back on track is to go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what do i mean by top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ their basic theori __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
romnei __PUNCT__ hi friend in congress __PUNCT__ thei basic believ that if we just give more tax cut __PUNCT__ on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ to the wealthiest american and we get rid of regul that we place on wall street bank __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ to make sure we don't have anoth crisi __PUNCT__ or on the health care industri to make sure that thei don't discrimin against you becaus you got a preexist condit __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ the idea is that somehow __PUNCT__ if we cut tax for folk at the top and get rid of regul __PUNCT__ thi will lead to more job and more prosper to everybodi __PUNCT__
that their theori __PUNCT__
that the path that thei propos __PUNCT__
it not that complic __PUNCT__
that where thei will take us if thei win __PUNCT__ i guarante you __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of mr __PUNCT__ romnei econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
that the heart of hi econom plan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we know that thi tax cut would probabl be go to the wealthiest __NUM__ percent of all household __PUNCT__ we knew that __PUNCT__
but yesterdai an independ __PUNCT__ nonpartisan organ __PUNCT__ thei dug into the number __PUNCT__
thei investig __PUNCT__ what would it mean to give thi romnei plan a try __PUNCT__
and thi __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ thi is an organ that head by an economist who work for presid bush __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ so thi wa not my opinion __PUNCT__
thi wa not our team opinion __PUNCT__
thi is someth that wa look at by a nonpartisan group __PUNCT__
here what thei found __PUNCT__
thei found that folk make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ the top on __PUNCT__ tenth of __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ would get a tax cut under mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan of almost a quarter of a million dollar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
two hundr and fifti thousand dollar would go to folk who ar make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
that the averag __PUNCT__ that the typic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei claim that he go to get thi tax cut and he go to bring down the deficit __PUNCT__
so then the question is __PUNCT__ who do you think get the bill for these __MONEY__ tax cut __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we do __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thi is a smart crowd __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you do __PUNCT__
thi analysi also found that if governor romnei want to keep hi word and pai for hi plan so that he doe not increas the deficit even more __PUNCT__ the averag middl class famili with children would be stuck with a tax increas of more than __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so i want everybodi to understand here __PUNCT__ he not ask you to pai an extra __MONEY__ to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ he not ask you to pai an addit __MONEY__ to help care for our senior __PUNCT__ he not ask to pai an addit __MONEY__ in order to rebuild america or to fight a war __PUNCT__ he ask you to pai more so that peopl like him can pai less __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that peopl like me pai less __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ in order to afford on __MONEY__ tax cut for somebodi like mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ a hundr and twenti __PUNCT__ five famili __PUNCT__ like mani of your __PUNCT__ would have to pai an addit __MONEY__ in tax __PUNCT__
and that not a on __PUNCT__ time thing __PUNCT__ thi would be each and everi year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i just want you to know thi studi wa releas yesterdai __PUNCT__
so hi campaign wa ask about it __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what do you think __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ first thei said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi is a liber organ __PUNCT__ despit the fact that it head by an economist who work for georg bush __PUNCT__
then thei said that the studi fail to fulli take into account the massiv econom boom that would come from cut tax on the wealthiest american and the biggest corpor __PUNCT__ becaus we all know how well that work out the last time we tri it __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ orlando __PUNCT__ we know better __PUNCT__
thei have tri to sell us thi trickl __PUNCT__ down tax cut fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it will not work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it is not a plan to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
it is not a plan to build our middl class __PUNCT__
it is not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
it take us backward to a place we don't need to be __PUNCT__
we do not need more tax cut for folk who have done veri __PUNCT__ veri well __PUNCT__
we need more tax cut for work american __PUNCT__
we need tax cut for famili who ar try to rais your children and keep your children healthi and send them to colleg and put roof over their head __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ we need tax cut for compani that ar invest here in florida and here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ send product around the world stamp with those proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run again for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so listen __PUNCT__ when it come to tax and reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ i got a differ plan for america __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__ that exactli what i did __PUNCT__ by a total of about __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
now i want to keep incom tax exactli where thei ar on the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom tax __PUNCT__
so if you a famili that make under __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of american famili do __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ like i am __PUNCT__ all we ask is that we contribut a littl bit more so that we can pai down our debt and so that we can still invest thing __PUNCT__ in thing like educ and infrastructur and basic scienc and advanc manufactur __PUNCT__ all those thing that help us grow as an economi __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ i go to make sure govern doe it part __PUNCT__
we go to have to cut awai spend that we don't need __PUNCT__
we made enorm progress in make govern more effici and streamlin it __PUNCT__ but we can do more __PUNCT__
we cut a trillion dollar alreadi __PUNCT__
we can do more __PUNCT__
but i not go to pai for a massiv new tax cut for folk who don't need it by gut the invest that have alwai kept us at the forefront and have kept our middl class strong __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ just like we tri their wai __PUNCT__ what i talk about we tri too __PUNCT__
all i ask is that we go back to the rate that were paid by wealthi individu under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and if you rememb __PUNCT__ that when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we creat the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__
and here the kicker __PUNCT__ it wa good for everybodi __PUNCT__
peopl at the top __PUNCT__ thei did well __PUNCT__ becaus if a construct worker ha a job and he got some monei in hi pocket __PUNCT__ then he might go out and bui that new applianc __PUNCT__
and if that small busi just open a restaur and now everybodi in the commun ha a littl extra monei to spend __PUNCT__ that restaur will do better __PUNCT__
and if you got a job and you feel pretti good __PUNCT__ got some monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ you might decid to get rid of that old beater and bui a new car __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ those busi hire more peopl __PUNCT__
and you get what call a virtuou cycl __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ if you believ their plan will make us better __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if you believ that it okai to pai for a big tax cut for folk who don't need it __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and ask you to pai for it __PUNCT__ and cut our invest in educ and voucher medicar and make a whole other rang of chang that will impos greater hardship on the middl class __PUNCT__ if you think we should set our sight lower like that __PUNCT__ settl for someth less __PUNCT__ then go ahead and send these folk to washington __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ that wa a rhetor question __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but let me ask you thi __PUNCT__ wouldn't we be better off if we keep fight for the thing that have alwai made us strong __PUNCT__ make sure our young peopl can afford to get a higher educ __PUNCT__
wouldn't we be better off if we develop new sourc of american energi becaus we put the monei into the research to develop them __PUNCT__ wouldn't we be better off if we were invest in thing like advanc manufactur to sell good around the rest of the world made right here in florida with american worker __PUNCT__ five year or __NUM__ year or __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__ won't we be better off if we made these smart __PUNCT__ sometim tough __PUNCT__ decis __PUNCT__ understand that we grow thi economi not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl out and from the bottom up __PUNCT__ creat an economi where everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
won't we be better off if we got the courag to keep work and fight and move forward __PUNCT__ that what i believ __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ my __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__
