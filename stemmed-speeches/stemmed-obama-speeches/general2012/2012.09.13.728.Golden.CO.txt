thi is a tumultu time that we in __PUNCT__
but we can and we will meet those challeng if we stai true to who we ar __PUNCT__ and if we would remind ourselv that we differ from other nation __PUNCT__
we ar differ not onli becaus of the incred landscap that god ha given us __PUNCT__ we differ becaus we a nation that bound togeth by a creed __PUNCT__
we not made up of a singl tribe or a singl religion or a singl race __PUNCT__
we a collect of peopl from all around the world who came here becaus of a certain set of principl __PUNCT__ the idea that all men and women ar creat equal __PUNCT__ that we ar all endow by our creator with certain inalien right __PUNCT__
that what bind us togeth __PUNCT__
that what our flag mean __PUNCT__
but we also believ that these ar not just american right __PUNCT__
we believ these ar univers aspir and thei held by peopl who live in tini villag in libya __PUNCT__ prosper citi in europ __PUNCT__

that what our citizen do __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
those ar the valu that we hold to __PUNCT__
and here in america __PUNCT__ there is no more fundament part of our democraci than the fact that all of you get a sai in the decis that ar made about our countri futur __PUNCT__
and that why we here todai __PUNCT__
over the past few week __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ you been offer two veri differ path for our futur __PUNCT__
you seen their convent __PUNCT__ you seen our __PUNCT__ and now you chase __PUNCT__ and now you face on big choic __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we with you __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
our __PUNCT__ our vision __PUNCT__ our fight __PUNCT__ is to restor the basic bargain that built the largest middl class and the strongest economi the world ever known __PUNCT__ the promis that sai hard work will pai off __PUNCT__ if you work hard you can make it __PUNCT__ that respons will be reward __PUNCT__ that in thi countri of our __PUNCT__ everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from wall street to main street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
and that basic bargain is why i ran for presid in the first place __PUNCT__ becaus i had watch a decad in which too mani job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__ in which too mani famili were struggl with cost that kept on go up __PUNCT__ but paycheck that didn't __PUNCT__ peopl have to try to cover basic expens with credit card and home equiti loan just to pai tuition for colleg or put ga in the car or food on the tabl __PUNCT__
and then we saw that hous of card that had been built up collaps in the worst recess sinc the great depress and million of innoc american __PUNCT__ includ folk here in colorado __PUNCT__ lost their home and their job __PUNCT__ their life save __PUNCT__
and for the last 3Â½ year __PUNCT__ we been fight to recov from the bodi blow that we took __PUNCT__
and we made progress __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we made progress __PUNCT__
we were lose __NUM__ job a month __PUNCT__ we creat job now for the past __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
we save an american auto industri on the brink of go under __PUNCT__
manufactur is start to come back here in the unit state __PUNCT__
but we got so much more work to do __PUNCT__ becaus there still a lot of folk out there hurt __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ i don't think the best answer for todai new challeng ar the same old sale pitch __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ that what you heard mostli in tampa __PUNCT__
you heard a long litani of what folk thought wa wrong with america __PUNCT__ but thei didn't tell you much about what thei do to make it right __PUNCT__
thei want your vote __PUNCT__ but thei didn't tell you their plan __PUNCT__
becaus basic their plan wa on that you had heard befor __PUNCT__ if we cut more tax __PUNCT__ everybodi is go to be okai __PUNCT__ especi if we cut tax at the top __PUNCT__
tax cut in good time __PUNCT__
tax cut in bad time __PUNCT__
tax cut when we at peac __PUNCT__
tax cut when we at war __PUNCT__
you need to make a restaur reserv __PUNCT__ you don't need the new iphon __PUNCT__ here a tax cut for that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you want to learn a new languag __PUNCT__ try a tax cut __PUNCT__
tax cut to lose a few extra pound __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ whatev ail you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i cut tax for folk who need them __PUNCT__ middl class famili __PUNCT__ small __PUNCT__ busi owner __PUNCT__
that who need them __PUNCT__
the typic famili ha seen their feder incom tax go down __PUNCT__ their incom tax burden go down by __MONEY__ sinc i came into offic __PUNCT__ becaus it wa import to provid folk who need it relief __PUNCT__
small busi __PUNCT__ we cut their tax __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
so i want to give tax relief to folk who need it __PUNCT__ but i don't believ anoth round of tax cut for millionair ar go to bring good job back to our shore __PUNCT__
thei not go to bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
just like i don't believ that fire teacher or kick student off of financi aid is go to grow our economi __PUNCT__ especi when we got to compet with the scientist and engin that ar come out of china __PUNCT__
and i got to sai __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ after all we been through __PUNCT__ the idea that we would roll back regul that we final put in place on wall street to make sure thei don't act recklessli again and bring the economi back to it knee __PUNCT__ i don't think roll back regul ar go to help the small __PUNCT__ businesswoman in jefferson countri or laid __PUNCT__ off construct worker that ar try to get back to work __PUNCT__
golden __PUNCT__ we have been there __PUNCT__
we tri that __PUNCT__ it didn't work __PUNCT__

we don't believ in a top __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ trickl __PUNCT__ down economi that sai to everybodi __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
we believ that we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we believ that the economi grow from the middl class out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that how we move forward __PUNCT__
and i won't pretend that the path i offer is easi __PUNCT__
bill clinton remind us last week __PUNCT__ it go to take a few more year to deal with all the challeng that we built up over decad __PUNCT__
but when i hear some folk __PUNCT__ i guess __PUNCT__ just for polit reason __PUNCT__ sai how america is in declin __PUNCT__ thei ar wrong __PUNCT__
we still have the world best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best research and scientist in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best democraci in the world __PUNCT__
there is not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
our problem can be solv __PUNCT__ and our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
and the path i offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
i ask __PUNCT__ at thi point __PUNCT__ the presid sneez __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i get all choke up __PUNCT__

and todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
that what we done __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can revers thi progress __PUNCT__ like the other side ha talk about __PUNCT__ or we can build on it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let the oil compani write our energi plan __PUNCT__
i not go to get rid of the wind energi tax credit that is help to spur thi incred dynam sector of our economi __PUNCT__
we go to build on thi progress __PUNCT__
we need to keep invest in wind and solar and make sure our farmer and scientist ar har new biofuel __PUNCT__
let put our construct worker back to work build energi __PUNCT__ effici home and factori __PUNCT__
let develop a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and creat hundr of thousand of new job all across thi countri __PUNCT__
that the path forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i got a plan to give american a greater chanc to gain the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa a gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__
let face it __PUNCT__ a mix kid from hawaii born to a singl mom is not like to becom presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
but in america __PUNCT__ it can happen becaus of educ __PUNCT__ becaus somebodi gave me opportun __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ a littl black girl from the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ whose mom is a secretari and dad is a blue collar worker __PUNCT__ not like to becom first ladi of the unit state __PUNCT__
but it happen becaus she got a great educ __PUNCT__ even though her folk didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__
it the gatewai of opportun for middl class famili __PUNCT__ for those who ar will to work hard to get into the middl class and stai there __PUNCT__
and becaus of the work we done over the last 3Â½ year __PUNCT__ million of student ar pai less for colleg todai becaus we took out billion of dollar that wa be wast us bank and lender as middlemen __PUNCT__ we start give these loan directli to student __PUNCT__
and now million more ar qualifi to get help __PUNCT__
we set up a tuition tax credit so that middl class famili can get a __MONEY__ tuition credit over __NUM__ year to help their kid go to school __PUNCT__
now we got to build on that progress __PUNCT__
and you got a choic __PUNCT__
and the other side __PUNCT__ thei propos to gut educ to pai for more tax break for folk like me __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
i think we got a better path __PUNCT__
we can decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom or a crumbl school or outdat textbook __PUNCT__
and no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter just becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find the right skill for folk here in the unit state __PUNCT__
so i ask you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher and improv earli childhood educ and get __NUM__ million more worker the chanc to go to commun colleg to get the skill thei need for the job that ar out there right now __PUNCT__
and let help bring down colleg and univers tuition cost over the next sever year __PUNCT__
we can meet that goal __PUNCT__
you can choos that futur for america __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye we can __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
you rememb that __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we can do all thi and we can reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
so i put forward a plan that will reduc our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
that not my opinion __PUNCT__ there independ analysi that been done __PUNCT__ thi will reduc the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
i work with republican in congress alreadi to cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__ and i will to work with them to do more __PUNCT__
everybodi talk about how partisan everyth is __PUNCT__
listen __PUNCT__ i am happi to work with republican __PUNCT__
i want their cooper __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ if thei want me __PUNCT__ i wash the car __PUNCT__ i walk the dog for them __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ to get a deal done for the american peopl __PUNCT__
i want to reform our tax code so that it simpl and so that it fair __PUNCT__
there ar area where we should be abl to agre __PUNCT__
but here the thing i can't do __PUNCT__
i can't ask millionair to do noth __PUNCT__ and then ask everybodi els to do a whole lot __PUNCT__
so i ask __PUNCT__ under my plan __PUNCT__ the wealthiest household will pai a slightli higher rate on their incom tax after the __MONEY__ threshold __PUNCT__ so thei still get a tax cut for the first __MONEY__
that would appli to __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
but for that dollar after __NUM__ you pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ the same rate that you paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ the same rate that wa in forc when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and we creat a lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i want you to understand why thi is import __PUNCT__
if we take that approach where folk like me and governor romnei ar pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ then we can keep tax low for middl class famili __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of american famili make __MONEY__ or less __PUNCT__
and so we can keep your tax cut in place __PUNCT__ and we can still invest in our futur __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ when you got some tax relief __PUNCT__ when the firefight or the teacher or the construct worker or the receptionist __PUNCT__ when you gui __PUNCT__ when the small __PUNCT__ businessperson __PUNCT__ becaus __NUM__ percent of small busi make less than __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ when you have monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus you have to __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ your car is __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ and you got a boiler in the hous you got to fix __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ so there ar thing you do with the monei __PUNCT__
that mean __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ busi have more custom __PUNCT__
that mean busi make more profit and busi hire more worker __PUNCT__ which mean __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ the economi get that much stronger __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
not from the top down __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__
that how we do it __PUNCT__
that how we alwai done it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ the other side doe have a plan also __PUNCT__
but as presid clinton point out __PUNCT__ it doesn't have arithmet in it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ these ar folk who sai that their biggest prioriti is reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
thi is a gener oblig __PUNCT__ we got to do right by our kid __PUNCT__ et cetera __PUNCT__
so what their first propos __PUNCT__ thei think that we go to lower our deficit by spend trillion of dollar more on new tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that doesn't add up __PUNCT__
when you try to pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut __PUNCT__ there ar onli so mani place you can go __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ you can gut educ invest and invest in research and technolog __PUNCT__ and we can stop rebuild our infrastructur __PUNCT__
but even if you do all that __PUNCT__ you haven't come close to __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
so eventu __PUNCT__ what independ analysi sai is that middl class famili ar go to have to pai for it __PUNCT__
or altern __PUNCT__ the deficit blow up __PUNCT__
and if you don't see that math __PUNCT__ then you got to go see your teacher after school __PUNCT__
you got to go talk to lisa and get some __PUNCT__ get a tutori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and on top of the __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that thei talk about that would give the averag person make __MONEY__ million a year a __MONEY__ tax cut __PUNCT__ in addit __PUNCT__ thei want to add __MONEY__ trillion in new militari spend without increas __PUNCT__ thei sai thei not go to increas the deficit __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ your calcul is go to go out on you if you try to add all that stuff up __PUNCT__
so listen __PUNCT__ golden __PUNCT__ i refus to ask middl class famili to pai more so that i pai less __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl just to pai for tax cut to the wealthi that we cannot afford __PUNCT__
and i will not turn medicar into a voucher just to give tax cut to the wealthi __PUNCT__
no american should ever have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and we go to reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ by make the health care system smarter so that instead of five test __PUNCT__ you get on test __PUNCT__ and then it e __PUNCT__ mail everywher __PUNCT__
and we reduc all the paperwork becaus we enhanc inform technolog in the health care system __PUNCT__
and we do more prevent care __PUNCT__
those ar the thing that ar go to reduc the cost of care __PUNCT__
but we don't just shift those cost on to senior and ask them to pai thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
that not right __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and we ar certainli go to make sure that we keep the promis of social secur __PUNCT__
we take respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ but we not go to turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
so we go to rebuild our economi __PUNCT__
but our prosper at home is link to what we do abroad __PUNCT__
and thi week event remind us of that __PUNCT__
so __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
and while a two __PUNCT__ new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ and usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
but we see on our televis that there ar still threat to the world __PUNCT__ in the world __PUNCT__ and we got to remain vigil __PUNCT__
that why we have to be relentless in pursu those who attack us thi week __PUNCT__
that also why __PUNCT__ so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and that why when our troop take off their uniform we will serv them as well as they've,serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who ha fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that is a solemn oath that we have to keep __PUNCT__
and we will us the monei we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg __PUNCT__ school and runwai __PUNCT__ help local commun hire firefight and polic offic and first __PUNCT__ respond __PUNCT__
becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here __PUNCT__ right here in colorado __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let put american back to work __PUNCT__
we can do all thi __PUNCT__
and the power to do it is where it ha alwai been __PUNCT__ in your hand __PUNCT__
i said thi at the convent __PUNCT__ the elect __NUM__ year ago wasn't about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you __PUNCT__
you were the chang __PUNCT__
you the on who made it happen __PUNCT__
you the reason that there a teacher and her husband in pueblo who can now bui their first home with the help of new tax credit __PUNCT__
you the reason that a woman outsid durango can get the treatment she need for her breast cancer __PUNCT__ now that there ar afford plan to cover preexist condit __PUNCT__
you the reason senior across colorado ar save an averag of nearli __MONEY__ everi year on prescript drug becaus of obamacar __PUNCT__
and it true __PUNCT__ i do care __PUNCT__
that why we push it __PUNCT__
you care __PUNCT__
that why we made it happen __PUNCT__
you the reason that a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason why a selfless soldier won't be kick out of the militari becaus of who thei ar or who thei love __PUNCT__ we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
you the reason why thousand of famili have final been abl to sai to their love on who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
and the onli wai america keep move forward is if you don't stop __PUNCT__
you can't bui into the cynic that the other side is sell __PUNCT__
you can't let them convinc you somehow that chang isn't possibl __PUNCT__
if you give up on the idea that your voic make a differ __PUNCT__ then other peopl rush in to fill the void __PUNCT__ the lobbyist __PUNCT__ the special interest __PUNCT__ the folk who ar write the __MONEY__ million check to run all those neg ad __PUNCT__ the folk who ar try to make it harder for you to vote __PUNCT__ the washington politician who want to decid for you who you can marri or what kind of health care women should get __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we can't let that happen __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
and that why i need your help __PUNCT__ becaus we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
we got more good job to creat __PUNCT__
we got more clean __PUNCT__ homegrown energi to gener __PUNCT__
we got more good school to build and more great teacher to hire __PUNCT__
we got more troop to bring home and more veteran to care for __PUNCT__
and we got more door of opportun to open to everybodi who is will to work hard and walk through them __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ young __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ straight __PUNCT__ abl __PUNCT__ not __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__
that what i ask __PUNCT__ that you keep go forward __PUNCT__
that why i ask for a second term __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
