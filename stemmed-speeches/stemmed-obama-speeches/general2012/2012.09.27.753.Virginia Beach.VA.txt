thi is not just a choic between two candid or two parti __PUNCT__ it a choic between two fundament differ vision about how we move forward __PUNCT__ two differ idea about our futur __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ i believ that as a nation __PUNCT__ we move forward again __PUNCT__
we not where we need to be __PUNCT__ not yet __PUNCT__
we got a lot more folk who have to get back to work __PUNCT__

no __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i know some in the crowd mai be a littl bias __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i also want to speak to the audienc who mai be see thi over the televis __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ my oppon a big believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
he think that if you just spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion on tax cut that favor the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ if you get rid of more regul on wall street __PUNCT__ that job and prosper will rain down on everybodi __PUNCT__
the deficit will magic disappear __PUNCT__
we live happili ever after __PUNCT__
but there a problem with thi __PUNCT__
we just tri thi __PUNCT__
we tri it in the last decad __PUNCT__ befor i wa elect presid __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ and it won't work now __PUNCT__
becaus top __PUNCT__ down econom doesn't work __PUNCT__
we don't need to doubl down on the same trickl __PUNCT__ down polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
thi countri doesn't succe when onli the rich get richer __PUNCT__
we succe when the middl class get bigger __PUNCT__ when there ar ladder of opportun for all who strive to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ when everybodi who will to work hard ha a chanc to get ahead and live up to their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
i don't think we can get veri far with leader who write off half the nation as a bunch of victim who never take respons for their own live __PUNCT__
i know i travel around a lot in virginia and across thi countri __PUNCT__ i don't meet a lot of victim __PUNCT__
i see hard __PUNCT__ work virginian __PUNCT__

and i see soldier who defend our freedom everi singl dai __PUNCT__
and i see those militari famili who ar wonder whether their love on ar go to come back home __PUNCT__ safe and sound __PUNCT__
that who i see __PUNCT__
we don't believ anybodi is entitl to success in thi countri __PUNCT__
we don't believ govern should help folk who aren't will to try to help themselv __PUNCT__
but we do believ in someth call opportun __PUNCT__
we do believ in a countri where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ where respons is reward __PUNCT__ where everyon get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
we believ in an america where no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter who you love __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that the countri i believ in __PUNCT__

so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to revers thi progress __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can build on that progress __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let the oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
i not go to see them collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better plan where we keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog and where farmer and scientist ar har new biofuel to power our car and truck and where we put construct worker back to work refit home and factori so thei more energi effici __PUNCT__ where we develop a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__ where we cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and creat hundr of thousand of job all across thi nation __PUNCT__

and so we have not just talk the talk __PUNCT__ we walk the walk when it come to educ __PUNCT__
million of student ar now __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ pai less becaus we took on a system that wa wast billion of taxpay dollar on bank and lender __PUNCT__ and we said let give that monei directli to student __PUNCT__
let keep interest rate on student loan low __PUNCT__
let make sure that we ar implement the post __PUNCT__ 9/11 gi bill so everybodi ha got a fair shot __PUNCT__

no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to reloc to china becaus thei couldn't find the worker thei need right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ i ask you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ and improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
help give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn skill at a commun colleg for a job that is hire right now __PUNCT__
help us keep tuition cost down for young peopl all across thi countri __PUNCT__
thei deserv opportun just like i got opportun __PUNCT__ just like you got opportun __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
we can meet these goal __PUNCT__
you can choos thi futur for america __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ i want to cut the deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
i put forward a veri specif plan to reduc the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
i alreadi work with republican in thi congress to cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__ and i will to do more __PUNCT__
i want to reform the tax code so it simpl and fair __PUNCT__
but i also want to make sure that the wealthiest household in america pai modestli higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ which is the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and we produc a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason is __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i said i cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
the typic famili ha seen their tax burden go down about __MONEY__ on the feder level becaus of our polici __PUNCT__
and i want to keep your tax low becaus you need it __PUNCT__
what happen when middl class famili have a littl extra monei __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei spend it __PUNCT__
mayb you got to final trade in that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car and get a new on __PUNCT__
mayb you need to bui a comput for your kid who go off to colleg __PUNCT__
and what happen is when the middl class or folk fight to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl extra monei __PUNCT__ thei spend it __PUNCT__
and now suddenli __PUNCT__ busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ which mean thei have more profit __PUNCT__ which mean thei do better so thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
and you get a virtuou cycl go up __PUNCT__
everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down but from the middl out __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ my oppon also ha a plan __PUNCT__
but as presid clinton point out down in charlott __PUNCT__ there on thing miss from it __PUNCT__ arithmet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ arithmet __PUNCT__
my oppon somehow sai we can lower our deficit while spend trillion of dollar more on new tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
and it doesn't add up __PUNCT__
everi few dai __PUNCT__ he keep on sai he go to __PUNCT__ reboot __PUNCT__ thi campaign and thei go to start explain veri specif how thi plan is go to work __PUNCT__ and then thei don't __PUNCT__
thei don't sai how you pai for __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut that ar skew toward the wealthi without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
thei don't explain how you spend __MONEY__ trillion more on militari spend that our militari hasn't ask for without have you foot the bill __PUNCT__
the math doesn't add up __PUNCT__
my oppon think it fair that somebodi who make __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ like him __PUNCT__ pai a lower tax rate than a cop or a teacher who make __NUM__ __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i just disagre __PUNCT__
i don't think that fair __PUNCT__
and i don't think it help grow our economi __PUNCT__
and i refus to ask middl class famili to give up your deduct for own a home or rais kid just so we pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask the colleg student who ar here to pai more or kick kid off of head start or elimin health insur for million of poor and elderli and disabl just to pai for a tax cut for me __PUNCT__
that is not right __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
and i will never __PUNCT__ ever turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__ becaus no american should have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei work all their live __PUNCT__ thei should be abl to retir with digniti __PUNCT__
we reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
just like we go to keep the promis of social secur by take the respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ and that mean we not by turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ our prosper at home is link to our polici abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan in a respons wai __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
you got a new tower across the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
but we still face seriou threat __PUNCT__ as we saw just a coupl of week ago with the tragic death of our ambassador and three of hi colleagu __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and as jim webb so eloqu state __PUNCT__ when our troop take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon seem to have differ view __PUNCT__
he said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ he won't tell us how or what he do in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and i will us the monei we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__ becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it is time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
so that the choic we now face __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
love you back __PUNCT__
but that what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ thei keep on run these ad __PUNCT__ and their basic messag is __PUNCT__ is that somehow bigger tax cut and fewer regul is the onli wai __PUNCT__ that becaus govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their theori is __PUNCT__ if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
their theori is __PUNCT__ if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ we got a differ idea __PUNCT__
we fight on behalf of a differ idea __PUNCT__
we don't think that anybodi ow us anyth __PUNCT__ and we don't think govern can solv all our problem __PUNCT__
but we do think that the govern can help __PUNCT__ that it not the sourc of all our problem __PUNCT__
we don't believ in a polit that tri to separ peopl out __PUNCT__ whether it corpor or union or welfar recipi or immigr or gai or __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ that we in thi all togeth __PUNCT__
we believ america onli work when we accept certain respons for ourselv __PUNCT__ but also for other and for futur gener __PUNCT__ to creat more opportun and more possibl for thi nation __PUNCT__
