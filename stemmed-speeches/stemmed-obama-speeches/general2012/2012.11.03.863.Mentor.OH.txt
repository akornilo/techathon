now __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ you have a choic to make __PUNCT__ although here in ohio __PUNCT__ there earli vote __PUNCT__ so you could make it right after you leav here __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid or two parti __PUNCT__
it a choic about two differ vision for america __PUNCT__
it a choic between go back to the top __PUNCT__ down polici that crash our economi __PUNCT__ or a futur that built on a strong and grow middl class __PUNCT__
when you think about the histori of our economi __PUNCT__ we alwai honor the entrepreneur and the small __PUNCT__ businessmen __PUNCT__ the striver __PUNCT__ the dreamer __PUNCT__ the risk taker __PUNCT__ thei the drive forc behind our free enterpris system __PUNCT__ and that the greatest engin of growth and prosper the world ever known __PUNCT__
but we also believ that in thi countri __PUNCT__ our busi do well __PUNCT__ market do well when everybodi is given a shot __PUNCT__ when thei have a chanc __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__ to get a decent educ and learn new skill __PUNCT__ when we support research into medic breakthrough or new technolog __PUNCT__
we believ america is stronger when everybodi can count on afford health insur and medicar and social secur __PUNCT__
we think america is stronger when there ar rule __PUNCT__ some rule in place to protect our kid from toxic dump __PUNCT__ to protect consum from be taken advantag of by unscrupul credit card compani or mortgag lender __PUNCT__
we think that washington ha a role to plai in make sure that we creat great infrastructur __PUNCT__ road and bridg __PUNCT__ in our countri __PUNCT__ so that we can move product and servic everywher __PUNCT__
and then we also believ there ar some thing washington doesn't need to do __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ washington shouldn't control the health care choic that women ar capabl of make for themselv __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mentor __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we had a presid who share these belief __PUNCT__
hi name wa bill clinton __PUNCT__
and hi econom plan ask the wealthiest to pai a littl bit more so we could reduc our deficit and still invest in the skill and idea of our peopl __PUNCT__
and at the time __PUNCT__ when he first came into offic __PUNCT__ the republican in congress and a senat candid by the name of mitt romnei __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ but thei said that bill clinton plan would hurt the economi __PUNCT__ that it would kill job __PUNCT__
and it turn out hi math wa just as bad back then as it is todai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ becaus by the end of presid clinton second term __PUNCT__ america had creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
incom were up __PUNCT__
poverti wa down __PUNCT__
our deficit had becom a surplu __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ we know our idea __PUNCT__
we know thei work __PUNCT__
we also know the idea of the other gui __PUNCT__ thei don't work __PUNCT__ becaus we tri those too __PUNCT__
for most of the last decad __PUNCT__ befor i came into offic __PUNCT__ we tri give big tax cut to wealthi american __PUNCT__
we tri give insur compani and oil compani and wall street free licens to do whatev thei want to do __PUNCT__
and what we got wa fall incom __PUNCT__ record deficit __PUNCT__ and the slowest job growth in half a centuri __PUNCT__ all end with a econom crisi that we been clean up after ever sinc __PUNCT__
so thi isn't an abstract debat __PUNCT__
we have tri our idea __PUNCT__ and thei work __PUNCT__
we tri their idea __PUNCT__ and thei don't work __PUNCT__
governor romnei __PUNCT__ he a veri talent salesman __PUNCT__
so in thi campaign __PUNCT__ he ha tri as hard as he can to repackag the same polici that didn't work and offer them up as chang __PUNCT__
but here the problem __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ we know what chang look like __PUNCT__ and what he offer ain't it __PUNCT__
give more power to the biggest bank __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut favor the wealthi __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
refus to answer the detail of your polici until after the elect __PUNCT__ that definit not chang __PUNCT__
that the oldest trick in the book __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ rule out compromis __PUNCT__ pledg to rubberstamp the tea parti agenda __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
chang the fact when thei inconveni to your campaign __PUNCT__ that definit not chang __PUNCT__
but that what governor romnei ha been do these last few week right here in ohio __PUNCT__
you got folk who work at the jeep plant who been call their employ __PUNCT__ worri __PUNCT__ ask if their job were be ship to china __PUNCT__
you heard about thi __PUNCT__
everybodi heard about thi __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and the reason thei worri is becaus governor romnei is run ad sai that jeep is ship job to china __PUNCT__
there onli on problem __PUNCT__ it not true __PUNCT__
everybodi know it not true __PUNCT__
the car compani themselv told governor romnei __PUNCT__ knock it off __PUNCT__
gm said __PUNCT__ we think creat job in the unit state should be a sourc of bipartisan pride __PUNCT__
thei don't want thi to becom some polit footbal in governor romnei tv ad __PUNCT__
and i couldn't agre more __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i understand that governor romnei ha had a tough time here in ohio becaus he wa against save the auto industri __PUNCT__
it hard to run awai from that posit when you on videotap sai __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
but that not a justif for run those kind of ad __PUNCT__ becaus thi is not a game __PUNCT__
these ar peopl job __PUNCT__
these ar peopl livelihood __PUNCT__
our car compani __PUNCT__ thei put a lot of effort and time and energi and monei into build up and restor the brand of american car __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ by american worker __PUNCT__
you don't scare hardwork american just to scare up some vote __PUNCT__
that not what be a presid all about __PUNCT__
when i first made the decis to rescu the auto industri __PUNCT__ i knew it wasn't popular __PUNCT__
it wasn't even popular in ohio and michigan __PUNCT__
but i also knew it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
bet on american worker wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
bet on american ingenu wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and that bet paid off __PUNCT__
it paid off in lordstown and toledo __PUNCT__ where compani ar creat new job not in china __PUNCT__ right here in ohio __PUNCT__
right here in the unit state __PUNCT__
and thi rais an essenti part of what your choic is all about __PUNCT__ becaus when you elect a presid __PUNCT__ you don't know what kind of emerg mai happen __PUNCT__ you don't know what problem he or she mai deal with __PUNCT__
but you do want to be abl to trust your presid __PUNCT__
you want to know that your presid mean what he sai and sai what he mean __PUNCT__
and after __NUM__ year as presid __PUNCT__ you know me __PUNCT__
you mai not agre with everi decis i made __PUNCT__
you mai at time have been frustrat by the pace of chang __PUNCT__
but you know what i believ __PUNCT__

i got the grai hair to show for it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you fought for chang too __PUNCT__
and after all we been through togeth __PUNCT__ we can't turn back __PUNCT__
we can't give up on it now __PUNCT__
chang __PUNCT__ let me tell you the chang i see move forward __PUNCT__
chang is a countri where everybodi ha a shot at a great educ __PUNCT__
and that mean parent have to parent and teacher have to teach __PUNCT__
but don't tell me that hire more teacher won't help grow thi economi __PUNCT__
don't tell me that student who can't afford colleg should just borrow more monei from their parent __PUNCT__
that wasn't an option for me __PUNCT__ and i bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you __PUNCT__
that why i want to cut the growth in tuition __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ year i want to cut the growth in half __PUNCT__
i want to recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher so our kid don't fall behind the rest of the world __PUNCT__
i want to train __NUM__ million american at our commun colleg with the skill busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
that the kind of chang we need __PUNCT__
that what we fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang __PUNCT__ real chang __PUNCT__ mean we live up to thi countri legaci of innov __PUNCT__
the great thing about what happen in the auto industri __PUNCT__ we not just build car again __PUNCT__ we build better car __PUNCT__ car that by the middl of the next decad will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar thousand of worker here in ohio and across the countri who ar build long __PUNCT__ last batteri and wind turbin __PUNCT__
and i don't __PUNCT__ i want to make sure thei keep build them here __PUNCT__
i don't want tax code that subsid oil compani profit when thei alreadi make monei hand over fist __PUNCT__ i want to help and support clean energi job here in ohio and the new technolog that will help us cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that reward compani for ship job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to give tax break and reward compani that ar creat the next gener of manufactur right here in america __PUNCT__ make american product __PUNCT__ stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that my plan for job and growth __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang is turn the page on a decad of war so we can do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ i will make sure that we pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
but it time to us the save from end the war in iraq and wind down the war in afghanistan to pai down our debt and rebuild america __PUNCT__ repair road and bridg and school all across our countri and put our veteran back to work __PUNCT__ becaus anybodi who ha serv or countri and fought for it freedom shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that my commit to them __PUNCT__
and that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang is a futur where we reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but we do it in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
i sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend cut __PUNCT__
i want to do more __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about the deficit __PUNCT__ then we got to ask the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ folk like me and governor romnei __PUNCT__ to go back to the tax rate that were paid when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
and the reason __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i promis you we can afford it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ second of all __PUNCT__ a budget is choic __PUNCT__ and if we seriou about reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ then we got to make choic __PUNCT__
and as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i will never try to reduc the deficit on the back of middl class folk and poor folk __PUNCT__
i not go to turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to make it more expens for young peopl to go to colleg just to give me a tax break __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ we know what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__
but we also know it not go to be easi __PUNCT__

thei engin a strategi of gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that democrat and republican had support in the past __PUNCT__
