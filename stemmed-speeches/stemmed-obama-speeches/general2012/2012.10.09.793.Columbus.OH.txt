boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
and we reinvent a dy auto industri that support on in eight ohio job and ha come roar back to the top of the world __PUNCT__
four year after the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ our busi have creat more than __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
thi past fridai __PUNCT__ we found out that the unemploy rate had fallen from a high of __NUM__ percent down to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the lowest level sinc i took offic __PUNCT__
manufactur is come back to america __PUNCT__
home valu ar back on the rise __PUNCT__

we still got too mani american who ar look for work and too mani famili who can't pai the bill __PUNCT__
there ar too mani home that ar still underwat __PUNCT__ and there ar too mani young peopl who ar burden by too much debt after thei graduat __PUNCT__
but if there on thing i know __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ it thi __PUNCT__ we have come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
the american peopl have work too hard __PUNCT__
and the last thing we can afford to do right now is to go back to the veri same polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
i cannot allow that to happen __PUNCT__
i will not allow it to happen __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ i seen a lot of folk hurt __PUNCT__
i seen a lot of struggl __PUNCT__
and i am not go to make __PUNCT__ i not go to have us go back to anoth round of top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
but that what my oppon is offer __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of governor romnei econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that favor the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
he ha been pitch that plan for an entir year __PUNCT__ stood up onstag in on of hi primari debat __PUNCT__ proudli promis that hi tax cut would includ the __PUNCT__ top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
but most of the economist who actual crunch the number said that pai for governor romnei tax plan either mean blow up the deficit or rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
on or the other __PUNCT__ pick your poison __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ last week __PUNCT__ mitt romnei actual said __PUNCT__ there no economist who can sai mitt romnei tax plan add __MONEY__ trillion if i sai i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan __PUNCT__
so he said if he sai it not true __PUNCT__ then it not true __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__
so if it true that it not go to add to the deficit __PUNCT__ that leav onli on option __PUNCT__ and that ask middl class famili to foot the bill by get rid of the deduct thei reli on for own a home or rais their kid or send them to colleg __PUNCT__
and as it turn out __PUNCT__ most folk don't like that idea either __PUNCT__
so just last week when we were onstag togeth __PUNCT__ governor romnei decid that instead of chang hi plan __PUNCT__ he just pretend it didn't exist __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ what __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ i don't know anyth about a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
pai no attent to that tax cut under the carpet __PUNCT__ behind the curtain __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ when he ask how he cut the deficit __PUNCT__ he sai he can make the math work by elimin local public fund for pb __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ thi is not new __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and governor romnei want to let wall street run wild again __PUNCT__ but he go to bring down the hammer on sesam street __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ that is not leadership __PUNCT__ that salesmanship __PUNCT__
we can't afford it __PUNCT__
we can't afford to doubl down on top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
we can't afford anoth round of tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__
we can't afford to roll back regul on wall street bank or on insur compani __PUNCT__
we can't afford to gut our invest in educ or clean energi or research or technolog __PUNCT__
that is not a job plan __PUNCT__
that is not a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__
that is not chang __PUNCT__
that is a relaps __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__
we have tri that __PUNCT__
we ar not go back __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ we got a differ view about how you creat job and prosper in america __PUNCT__
a strong economi doesn't trickl down from the top __PUNCT__
it grow from a thrive middl class and folk who ar work hard to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
i believ it time our tax code stop reward compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let reward small busi and manufactur who ar make product right here in ohio __PUNCT__ product stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i believ we can creat more job by control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
and after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in two decad __PUNCT__
so now it time to move forward __PUNCT__
my plan would cut our oil import in half and invest in the clean energi that creat thousand of job all across ohio and america right now __PUNCT__ not just oil and natur ga __PUNCT__ but solar and wind and clean coal technolog and fuel __PUNCT__ effici batteri and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__
and i not go to let oil compani continu to collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in taxpay __PUNCT__ fund corpor welfar everi singl year __PUNCT__
i not go to let china win the race for clean energi technolog __PUNCT__
i want to see that technolog develop by student and scientist here in columbu __PUNCT__ by worker and farmer all across ohio __PUNCT__ by patriot here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and my plan will continu to reduc the carbon pollut that is heat our planet __PUNCT__ becaus climat chang is not a hoax __PUNCT__
more draught and flood and wildfir ar not a joke __PUNCT__
thei a threat to your futur __PUNCT__
and we got to make sure that we meet the moment __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
i believ that we should have the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__ bar none __PUNCT__
i would not be here if it were not for the educ i wa abl to receiv __PUNCT__
i didn't come from wealth or fame __PUNCT__ but i got a great educ becaus that what thi countri doe __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ it wa the gatewai of opportun for michel __PUNCT__
it the gatewai of opportun for so mani of you __PUNCT__
and now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can gut educ to pai for governor romnei tax cut __PUNCT__ that exactli what hi run mate __PUNCT__ paul ryan __PUNCT__ propos __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ or we can do what i propos __PUNCT__ recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__
focu on earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
provid job train for __NUM__ million worker at our commun colleg __PUNCT__
cut the growth of tuition cost in half so that you gui ar not load up with debt when you graduat __PUNCT__
that is someth we can do __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i don't just talk the talk on thi __PUNCT__ i walk the walk __PUNCT__
we took __MONEY__ billion that wa go to bank and lender under the student loan program __PUNCT__ and we said let cut out the middleman __PUNCT__ let give the monei directli to student __PUNCT__
and as a consequ __PUNCT__ million of young peopl all across the countri ar get better deal on pell grant __PUNCT__
we abl to keep our student loan rate low __PUNCT__
we have focus on thi __PUNCT__ and you need to focu on thi in thi next elect becaus thi is part of the choic that you go to face __PUNCT__
and we can meet these goal togeth __PUNCT__
you can choos a better futur for america __PUNCT__
i want to us the monei we save from end the war in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ and i want to us that to pai down our deficit __PUNCT__ but also to put peopl back to work rebuild our road and our bridg and our school all across america __PUNCT__
and governor romnei said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
i disagre __PUNCT__
i think bring our troop home to their famili wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
if he gotten hi wai __PUNCT__ those troop would still be there __PUNCT__
in a speech yesterdai __PUNCT__ he doubl down on that belief __PUNCT__
he said end that war wa a mistak __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of war __PUNCT__ more than __MONEY__ trillion in spend __PUNCT__ extraordinari sacrific by our men and women in uniform and their famili __PUNCT__ he said we should still have troop on the ground in iraq __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ you can't turn a page on the fail polici of the past if you promis to repeat them __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to go back to a foreign polici that get us into war with no plan to end them __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__ not go back __PUNCT__
and everi brave american who wear the uniform of thi countri should know __PUNCT__ as long as i your command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop take off the uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us becaus nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i cut the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i alreadi work with the republican and democrat to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__ and i readi to do more __PUNCT__
but we can't just cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
we not go to get thi done unless we also ask the wealthiest household to pai higher tax on their incom over __MONEY__
and that rate is the on that wa in place when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ our economi creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
governor romnei said it fair that he pai a lower tax rate than a teacher or autowork who make __MONEY__
he is wrong __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to pai for that tax cut by ask you __PUNCT__ student __PUNCT__ to pai more for colleg or kick kid out of head start program or elimin health care for million of american who ar poor or disabl or elderli __PUNCT__
and that the choic that we face in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
over and over __PUNCT__ we been told by governor romnei and congressman ryan and their alli in congress that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if a compani releas pollut into the air that your kid breath __PUNCT__ that just the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ just borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ that we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we understand that america is not about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ it about what can be done by us togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
and that what we understood in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that wa an amaz experi for me __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ that elect __PUNCT__
but i said then __PUNCT__ and i still believ now __PUNCT__ that wasn't about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you __PUNCT__
you the reason a mother in cincinnati doesn't have to worri about aninsur compani deni her son coverag just becaus he got sick __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you the reason a factori worker who lost hi job in toledo or lordstown is back on the assembl line build the best car in the world __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason a young man in columbu whose mother work three job to rais him can afford to go to the ohio state univers __PUNCT__
that happen becaus of you __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
why soldier won't be kick out of the militari becaus of who thei ar or who thei love __PUNCT__
why thousand of famili have final been abl to sai to love on who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
and so if you bui into the cynic that sai chang isn't possibl __PUNCT__ that the best we can do is more tax cut for folk at the top and the rest of folk have to figur it out __PUNCT__ if you give up on the idea that your voic can make a differ __PUNCT__ then other voic fill the void __PUNCT__ the lobbyist and the special interest __PUNCT__ the peopl who write the __MONEY__ million check to try to bui thi elect __PUNCT__ or those who ar try to make it harder for you to vote __PUNCT__ the washington politician who want to tell women what thei do when it come to health care choic when women ar perfectli capabl of make those choic themselv __PUNCT__
that what at stake __PUNCT__
and onli you can make sure that we move forward __PUNCT__
onli you have that power to move us forward __PUNCT__
we alwai said that chang __PUNCT__ real chang __PUNCT__ take time __PUNCT__ more than on year __PUNCT__ more than on term __PUNCT__ even more than on presid __PUNCT__
it take more than on parti __PUNCT__
it can't happen if you somebodi who write off half the nation befor you even took offic __PUNCT__
and in __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ it interest __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ percent of the countri didn't vote for me __PUNCT__
but on the night of the elect __PUNCT__ i said to those american __PUNCT__ i mai not have won your vote __PUNCT__ but i hear your voic __PUNCT__
i need your help __PUNCT__
i be your presid too __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ columbu __PUNCT__ i don't know how mani folk will be around vote for me thi time __PUNCT__ but i can tell you i will be there no matter what __PUNCT__
i be fight for you no matter what __PUNCT__ becaus i not fight to creat democrat job or republican job __PUNCT__ i fight to creat american job __PUNCT__
i not fight to improv school in red state or blue state __PUNCT__ i fight to improv school it the unit state __PUNCT__
the valu that we ar fight for don't belong to on parti or on group __PUNCT__
thei not black or white or hispan or asian or nativ america or gai or straight or disabl and not disabl __PUNCT__ thei ar american valu __PUNCT__
thei belong to all of us __PUNCT__
and i am absolut posit that we ar not as divid as our polit suggest __PUNCT__
i still believ we got more in common than our pundit tell us __PUNCT__
i still believ in you __PUNCT__
and i ask you to keep believ in me __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ i ask you for your vote __PUNCT__
and if you will to stand with me and work with me __PUNCT__ knock on some door and make some phone call for me __PUNCT__ we win franklin counti again __PUNCT__
