michel and i __PUNCT__ we been there __PUNCT__

we just finish pai off our student loan __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be make it harder for young peopl __PUNCT__
we should be make it easier for young peopl __PUNCT__
we shouldn't end the colleg tax credit we creat __PUNCT__
we should be expand it __PUNCT__
higher educ isn't a luxuri __PUNCT__
it is an econom necess for everi singl american __PUNCT__
you can decid that an energi plan written by and for the big oil compani will be best for america __PUNCT__ that an option __PUNCT__
but i think that the kind of all __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ abov strategi that we talk about __PUNCT__ a strategi that includ more american oil and ga __PUNCT__ but also more wind and solar __PUNCT__ and set new goal for effici and make sure that we get energi and us energi in smarter wai __PUNCT__ that the kei to the futur __PUNCT__
on of the thing that we done is develop new fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car will get nearli __NUM__ mile per gallon __PUNCT__
that doubl what thei ar now __PUNCT__
that mean you onli got to dig into your pocket to fill up your tank half as often __PUNCT__
but not onli doe it save you monei at the pump __PUNCT__ it move us closer to energi independ __PUNCT__
it reduc greenhous ga emiss by as much as all the car in the world emit each year combin __PUNCT__
thi is a smart thing to do __PUNCT__
it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ my oppon is against that __PUNCT__
so you go to have to make a decis __PUNCT__
just yesterdai my oppon call my posit on fuel effici standard __PUNCT__ extrem __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it doesn't seem extrem to me to want to have more fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__
mayb the steam engin is more hi speed __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i think that we set goal and we meet them __PUNCT__ that what we do as american __PUNCT__
listen __PUNCT__ what extrem about the idea that instead of give __MONEY__ billion a year in tax subsidi to oil compani that ar make a profit everi time you pump ga __PUNCT__ it make more sens to keep invest __PUNCT__ us that monei to invest in homegrown energi sourc that have never been more promis __PUNCT__
that not extrem __PUNCT__
that good for job __PUNCT__
that good for our economi __PUNCT__
it good for our planet __PUNCT__
it good for our futur __PUNCT__
that what at stake __PUNCT__
that what you decid __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
we could go back to a health care system that let insur compani decid who and when and what to cover __PUNCT__
but i think we got to move forward with obamacar __PUNCT__
it alreadi cut cost __PUNCT__
it cover more peopl __PUNCT__
it save live __PUNCT__
governor romnei ha promis that sometim on hi first dai __PUNCT__ he is go to kill obamacar __PUNCT__
he go to sit down __PUNCT__ grab a pen __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ thi would mean that he __PUNCT__ by a stroke of a pen __PUNCT__ appar he think that he can kick __NUM__ million young peopl off their parent plan __PUNCT__
he can make prescript drug higher for senior __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
suddenli __PUNCT__ folk with preexist condit ar out of luck __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
he call my health care law obamacar __PUNCT__ i call hi plan __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ doesn't __PUNCT__ care __PUNCT__
he run on the __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ doesn't __PUNCT__ care __PUNCT__ platform __PUNCT__
thi law is here to stai __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we not go to refight the battl of the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
i tell you __PUNCT__ on almost everi issu he want to go backward __PUNCT__ sometim all the wai to the last centuri __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you can sai that in thi centuri __PUNCT__ women should be trust to make their own health care choic __PUNCT__
you can sai that in thi centuri __PUNCT__ we don't think young immigr who were brought here when thei were children and understand themselv as american and have pledg allegi to the flag should suddenli be deport to countri where thei never been __PUNCT__
you can sai we shouldn't rewrit the constitut to prevent gai american who love each other from be abl to marri the peopl thei love __PUNCT__
you can reaffirm the strength of the american charact __PUNCT__
it doesn't come from shove anybodi to the sidelin __PUNCT__
it doesn't come from kick folk to the curb __PUNCT__
it come from hear everybodi voic __PUNCT__ har everybodi talent __PUNCT__ realiz that here in the unit state of america we ar greater togeth than we ar on our own __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that what you believ __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__ you get to decid about the futur of the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
governor romnei said that me end the war in iraq wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__
he doesn't have a plan to bring home the __NUM__ troop who will be come home from afghanistan next month __PUNCT__
he like to talk tough __PUNCT__ but he doesn't have a lot of detail when it come to these critic issu __PUNCT__
and so what i have said not just to you __PUNCT__ but most importantli __PUNCT__ to those young men and women in uniform who ar serv us everi singl dai is that you will know where i stand __PUNCT__
when i sai i will end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i will end it __PUNCT__
when i sai that we will go after bin laden __PUNCT__ we go after him __PUNCT__
and when i said that as we bring our troop home __PUNCT__ first from iraq __PUNCT__ now from afghanistan __PUNCT__ that as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ we will serv our veteran as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ i mean it __PUNCT__
becaus nobodi should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home after thei been fight for our freedom __PUNCT__
so here the bottom line __PUNCT__
pass a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut target at wealthiest american __PUNCT__ it won't creat job __PUNCT__
it sure won't bring down the debt __PUNCT__ it will increas it __PUNCT__
ignor inequ don't make them go awai __PUNCT__
deni climat chang doesn't make it stop __PUNCT__
look backward doesn't make our futur brighter __PUNCT__
it doesn't make your futur stronger __PUNCT__
in the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you get to choos __PUNCT__
and we got a plan that will actual lead to a better futur __PUNCT__
and you can prove the cynic wrong on more time __PUNCT__
but the other side will spend the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ spend more monei than we have ever seen in our live __PUNCT__ an avalanch of attack ad and insult and distract and sometim thei just make thing up __PUNCT__
but thei got a bunch of folk who can write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__ and thei just keep on run them __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ somebodi wa challeng on of their ad __PUNCT__ thei just __PUNCT__ thei made it up __PUNCT__ about work and welfar __PUNCT__
and everi outlet said __PUNCT__ thi is just not true __PUNCT__
and thei were ask about it and thei said __PUNCT__ on of their campaign peopl said __PUNCT__ we won't have the fact checker dictat our campaign __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we will not let the truth get in the wai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ think about that __PUNCT__
thei count on young peopl to just accept their version of the wai thing ought to be __PUNCT__
thei expect that you will not be pai attent enough or you will be distract enough or you will be discourag enough that you walk awai __PUNCT__ and that mean big oil write the energi bill __PUNCT__ and the insur compani write the health care bill __PUNCT__ and politician in washington decid what a woman can or can't do when it come to her own health __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ i think thei wrong __PUNCT__
i am count on you __PUNCT__
i count on you becaus those who oppos chang have alwai bet on your cynic __PUNCT__ thei alwai bet on a lack of hope __PUNCT__ and throughout american histori __PUNCT__ thei have lost that bet __PUNCT__
and thei go to lose that bet thi time too __PUNCT__ as long as you regist to vote __PUNCT__ as long as you go out there to vote __PUNCT__ as long as you get your friend to go out there and vote __PUNCT__
i need you __PUNCT__ america need you __PUNCT__ to close the gap between what is and what might be __PUNCT__
we got more job to creat and more good school to build __PUNCT__
we got more homegrown energi to gener __PUNCT__
we got more troop to bring home __PUNCT__
we got more young peopl to send to colleg __PUNCT__
we got more door of opportun to open to everybodi who is will to work hard and walk through them __PUNCT__
and it all depend on you __PUNCT__
so don't worri about let me down __PUNCT__ don't let america down __PUNCT__
don't let yourselv down __PUNCT__
go out there __PUNCT__
regist __PUNCT__
stand up __PUNCT__
and if you do __PUNCT__ we will win virginia __PUNCT__
and if we win virginia __PUNCT__ we will win thi elect __PUNCT__
and we will finish what we start __PUNCT__
and you and i togeth __PUNCT__ we remind the world just why it is the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
