we shouldn't be end colleg tax credit to pai for millionair __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ we should be make colleg more afford for everybodi who will to work for it __PUNCT__

we should work with our commun colleg to train anoth __NUM__ million american with the skill that busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
and that all part of my plan for the futur __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
that the america that we fight for __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang come when we live up to america legaci of innov __PUNCT__ where we make america home to the next gener of advanc manufactur and scientif discoveri and technolog breakthrough __PUNCT__
i proud that i bet on america worker and american ingenu and the american auto industri __PUNCT__

i don't want a tax code that subsid oil compani profit when thei make monei hand over fist __PUNCT__
i want to support the energi job of tomorrow and the new technolog that will cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__ that will reduc the carbon in our atmospher __PUNCT__ that will make us less depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
that my plan for growth and job __PUNCT__
that the futur i see in america __PUNCT__

let do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
that will not chang __PUNCT__
but it time to us some of the save from end the war in iraq and afghanistan to start pai down our debt __PUNCT__ to start rebuild america __PUNCT__
that part of be strong __PUNCT__
that part of our nation secur __PUNCT__
right now we can put peopl back to work all across colorado __PUNCT__ all across the countri __PUNCT__ fix road and bridg __PUNCT__ expand broadband to rural neighborhood __PUNCT__ make sure our school ar state of the art __PUNCT__
let put american back to work do the work that need to be done __PUNCT__
and let especi focu on our veteran __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that my commit to you __PUNCT__
that part of keep america strong __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang is a futur where we reduc our deficit in a wai that balanc and respons __PUNCT__
and i sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend cut __PUNCT__ i intend to do more __PUNCT__
we can streamlin agenc __PUNCT__
we can get rid of program that aren't work __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about the deficit __PUNCT__ we also have to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the tax rate thei paid when bill clinton wa in offic __PUNCT__
becaus a budget is all about prioriti __PUNCT__
it about what valu do we care about __PUNCT__
and as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i not go to turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to allow thi nation to be plung into anoth battl over health care reform and kick million of peopl off of health care and weaken all the reform that we put in place __PUNCT__ includ make sure that young peopl can stai on their parent plan till thei __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ just so insur compani can jump back into the driver seat __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i not go to allow politician in washington to control health care choic that women should make for themselv __PUNCT__
we not go to do that __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ we know what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__
we don't need a big govern agenda or a small govern agenda __PUNCT__ we need a middl class agenda that reward the valu of hard work and respons __PUNCT__
we don't need a partisan agenda __PUNCT__ we need a commonsens agenda that sai when we educ a poor child __PUNCT__ we all better off __PUNCT__ that sai when we fund the research of a young scientist __PUNCT__ her new discoveri will benefit everi american __PUNCT__
we need an agenda that recogn we don't just look out for ourselv __PUNCT__ we look out for on anoth other __PUNCT__ we look out for futur gener __PUNCT__
we meet those oblig by work togeth __PUNCT__
that the chang we believ in __PUNCT__
that what __NUM__ wa about __PUNCT__
that what thi elect about __PUNCT__
that why i need you to vote __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me be clear __PUNCT__ achiev thi agenda will not be easi __PUNCT__
it wasn't easi over these last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ it not go to be easi the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ when we talk about chang __PUNCT__ i told you i wasn't just talk about chang presid __PUNCT__ i wasn't just talk about chang parti __PUNCT__
i wa talk about chang our polit __PUNCT__
i ran becaus the voic of the american peopl __PUNCT__ your voic __PUNCT__ had been shut out of our democraci for wai too long __PUNCT__ by lobbyist and special interest and politician who think compromis is a dirti word and would sai anyth to win offic and do anyth to stai in offic __PUNCT__
and as we expect __PUNCT__ the protector of the statu quo ar a power forc in washington __PUNCT__
and over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ everi time we fought to make chang __PUNCT__ thei fought back with everyth thei got __PUNCT__
thei spent million to stop us from reform health care and wall street and student loan __PUNCT__
their strategi from the start wa to engin pure gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that tradition both democrat and republican have support __PUNCT__
and what thei now count on is that the american peopl will be so worn down by all the squabbl __PUNCT__ so tire of all the dysfunct __PUNCT__ that you actual reward obstruct __PUNCT__ either by vote for folk claim to bring about chang or not vote at all __PUNCT__ but either wai __PUNCT__ put peopl back in charg who advoc the veri same polici that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ their bet is on cynic __PUNCT__
thei count on you not vote __PUNCT__
that their entir strategi __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ my bet is on you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ my bet on you __PUNCT__
my bet on the decenc and good sens of the american peopl __PUNCT__
becaus despit all the resist __PUNCT__ despit all the setback __PUNCT__ we gotten done so much __PUNCT__ and we never lost sight of the vision that we share __PUNCT__ that you would have a voic __PUNCT__ that there would be somebodi at the tabl fight everi singl dai for middl class american __PUNCT__ for folk who ar work hard and struggl __PUNCT__
sometim republican in congress work with me to meet our goal __PUNCT__ to cut tax for small busi and famili like your __PUNCT__ to open up new market for american good __PUNCT__ to final repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
we had a coupl of realli brave republican who work with us on that __PUNCT__
and sometim we had big fight __PUNCT__ like when we forc the bank to stop overcharg for student loan __PUNCT__ which is how we made colleg more afford for million of young peopl __PUNCT__ like when we forc wall street to abid by the toughest rule sinc the 1930 __PUNCT__ like when we stop insur compani from discrimin against american with preexist condit like cancer or diabet so no on in america goe bankrupt just becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
i didn't fight those fight for ani partisan advantag __PUNCT__
i have shown my willing to work with anybodi of ani parti to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and if you want to break the gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ you vote for leader __PUNCT__ whether thei democrat __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ or independ __PUNCT__ who feel the same wai __PUNCT__
you vote for candid like shellei __PUNCT__ you vote for candid like michael bennet and mark udal and jare poli __PUNCT__ all who have shown themselv to be will to work across parti line to get thing done __PUNCT__ but who also know that there some core principl you don't compromis __PUNCT__
becaus if the price of peac in washington is cut deal that will kick student off financi aid or get rid of fund for plan parenthood or elimin health care for million on medicaid just to give millionair a tax cut __PUNCT__ then that not a deal worth have __PUNCT__
that not bipartisanship __PUNCT__
that not chang __PUNCT__
that surrend to the same statu quo that ha hurt middl class famili for wai too long __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ i not readi to give up on the fight __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i not readi to give up on that fight __PUNCT__
and i hope you aren't either __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__
i hope you aren't either __PUNCT__

the folk at the veri top in thi countri __PUNCT__ thei don't need anoth champion in washington __PUNCT__
thei alwai have a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__
thei alwai have access and influenc __PUNCT__
