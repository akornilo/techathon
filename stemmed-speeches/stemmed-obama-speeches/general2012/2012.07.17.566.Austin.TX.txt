and we didn't even have mapquest back then __PUNCT__ so you had to unfold the map __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and try to figur out how it fold back __PUNCT__ and we get lost __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ but when i think back to those time __PUNCT__ those earli campaign __PUNCT__ we travel to inner __PUNCT__ citi commun and rural commun and suburban commun __PUNCT__ and you meet folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ wealthi __PUNCT__ low incom __PUNCT__
and what wa fascin wa that everywher you went __PUNCT__ there wa a common theme __PUNCT__ a common thread __PUNCT__
i see an elderli coupl and i think about my grandpar __PUNCT__ my grandfath __PUNCT__ who fought in world war ii __PUNCT__ and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who work on a bomber assembl line while he wa gone __PUNCT__
and when he came back __PUNCT__ he wa abl to get a colleg educ on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to bui a home with the help of an fha loan __PUNCT__
and i think about the journei thei travel and how remark that wa and how that repres all that the greatest gener had done __PUNCT__
and then i meet a singl mom somewher and i think about my mom __PUNCT__ who basic rais me and my sister on her own becaus my father left __PUNCT__ and how she had to struggl to work while she wa put herself through school and still keep us on track __PUNCT__
and yet she wa __PUNCT__ becaus of the help of scholarship and grant __PUNCT__ abl to get her educ and then give me and my sister the best educ in the world __PUNCT__
and i thought about how that couldn't happen probabl in most place around the world __PUNCT__
and then i meet a work coupl somewher and i think about michel parent __PUNCT__
michel dad had ms __PUNCT__ so by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__
he had to us two cane __PUNCT__
and he had to wake up an hour earli everi morn __PUNCT__ earlier than everybodi els __PUNCT__ to get __PUNCT__ just to get dress __PUNCT__
and he work at a water filtrat plant __PUNCT__ a blue __PUNCT__ collar job __PUNCT__ and michel mom stai at home until thei were a littl older __PUNCT__ and then she went to work as a secretari __PUNCT__
and thei never had a lot __PUNCT__ and yet becaus of the love and the valu that were in that household __PUNCT__ michel and her brother were abl to get an unbeliev educ and go as far as their dream would take them __PUNCT__
and i hear these same kind of stori everywher i went __PUNCT__
and it remind me that what make america so except __PUNCT__ what make us so special __PUNCT__ is thi basic bargain __PUNCT__ thi basic idea that in thi countri __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ no matter what setback you mai experi __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ if you ar will to take respons __PUNCT__ then you can make it __PUNCT__
you can get ahead __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ for the overwhelm major of american __PUNCT__ that effort mean that you can find a job that support a famili __PUNCT__
and it mean that you can mayb get a home that you call your own and you can send your kid to a good school and not go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__ noth fanci __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ i wa tell some folk up in ohio about my favorit vacat when i wa a kid wa when i wa __NUM__ drive around the countri and travel around the countri with my mom and my sister and my grandma __PUNCT__
and most of the time we took greyhound buse and stai at howard johnson __PUNCT__
and if there wa ani kind of littl swim pool anywher __PUNCT__ i wa happi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and a big event wa go to the vend machin and bui a soda and then fill the ic bucket and carri it back __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that wa a big deal __PUNCT__
but the point wa you didn't do it __PUNCT__ it wasn't a luxuri __PUNCT__ it wa just the chanc to have a littl adventur with your famili __PUNCT__
and then part of that bargain wa that you could retir with digniti and respect at the end of a life and that you knew that your kid could achiev more than you did __PUNCT__ that their live would offer opportun you couldn't even imagin __PUNCT__
and that bargain __PUNCT__ that idea of who we ar as a peopl __PUNCT__ that what built thi countri __PUNCT__
that what made us into an econom superpow __PUNCT__ thi idea that anybodi could make it __PUNCT__
and be middl class didn't have anyth to do necessarili with just the monei in your bank account __PUNCT__ but it had to do with a set of valu and a set of belief about what wa import __PUNCT__
and it those valu that propel me to get into polit in the first place __PUNCT__ becaus i saw the bless in my life and i want to make sure everybodi in thi countri had those same bless __PUNCT__
and when we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ but also some republican and independ __PUNCT__ it wa becaus we share that belief __PUNCT__ that bargain __PUNCT__ and we had a sens that it wa slip awai from us __PUNCT__
we had gone through a decad where hard work didn't alwai translat into higher wage or higher incom and folk act respons didn't alwai get ahead __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the worst financi crisi and the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ which left million more unemploi __PUNCT__ and it look like thei were go to lose their home __PUNCT__ and struggl that much more to keep up with the rise cost of health care or a colleg educ __PUNCT__
but for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ i have not forgotten why i got into polit __PUNCT__ and i have not forgotten those valu __PUNCT__
and i haven't forgotten why we came togeth __PUNCT__ becaus we want to put thi countri back on a track where everybodi had a fair shot and everybodi did their fair share and everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
and what ha kept me go __PUNCT__ for all the progress we made __PUNCT__ 4½ million new job and half a million new manufactur job and us stabil the financi system and avert a great depress and invest in advanc manufactur __PUNCT__ for all the progress that we made __PUNCT__ what ha get __PUNCT__ kept me go everi singl dai is rememb that thing that ti us togeth __PUNCT__ that bind us as a peopl __PUNCT__ and understand that no matter what we went through __PUNCT__ no matter how mani time we get knock down __PUNCT__ that basic charact of america doe not chang __PUNCT__
who we ar doe not chang __PUNCT__
what we believ __PUNCT__ the valu we hold dear __PUNCT__ the import we place on hard work and that work be reward __PUNCT__ whether you ar start a small busi or punch a clock __PUNCT__ that idea that you can make it if you try here in america __PUNCT__ that what we been fight for __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we been try to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ but our goal ha not been to just get us back to where we were in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
our goal ha been to rebuild an economi that last for everybodi __PUNCT__ for all peopl __PUNCT__
and i am absolut convinc that we ar on that path __PUNCT__
and we ar not go backward __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i have to tell you __PUNCT__ there ar some who sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi is part of america fate as it enter into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ that other countri ar rise and we declin __PUNCT__
and i just don't bui that __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what hold us back is not __PUNCT__ it not the lack of new idea or big idea or polici prescript that could make a differ in educ or hous or health care or you name it __PUNCT__
what been hold us back is a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
and thi is not just about two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
thi is about two fundament differ vision for where we take our countri __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei got a particular view about how you grow the economi __PUNCT__ top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
their basic view is that if you take the bush tax cut and on top of that you then layer on __MONEY__ trillion more of tax cut __PUNCT__ mostli for the wealthi __PUNCT__ and you elimin regul on pollut or the regul we put in place to prevent anoth meltdown on wall street or regul to make sure that folk aren't be taken advantag of by unscrupul lender __PUNCT__ that if you just elimin govern intrus into the market and let folk at the veri top maxim their profit __PUNCT__ that we all do better __PUNCT__ we all be better off __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ that their theori __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ it is a theori __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you know __PUNCT__ it would be okai for them to make that argument if we hadn't just spent close to a decad try their theori __PUNCT__ which result in the most sluggish job growth in decad __PUNCT__ incom and wage for ordinari folk go down __PUNCT__ rise inequ __PUNCT__ surplus turn into deficit __PUNCT__ culmin in the worst econom crisi in our lifetim __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't know about how you gui oper in your live __PUNCT__ but my gener rule is if i do someth and it just realli doesn't work out __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ then i try to do someth differ the next time __PUNCT__

the histori of how we built thi countri wa everybodi have a chanc to pursu their dream and __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ us build opportun that made us the envi of the world __PUNCT__

the auto industri is roar back __PUNCT__ and thei build better car and more fuel __PUNCT__ effici car than ever __PUNCT__
that an exampl of what america can do when we work togeth __PUNCT__
but it not just the auto industri __PUNCT__
whether we talk about advanc manufactur of batteri that will help us run electr car __PUNCT__ or wind turbin __PUNCT__ or solar panel __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ i believ in make thing here in america __PUNCT__ and i believ in invent thing here in america __PUNCT__

and ultim __PUNCT__ you the on who ar go to be abl to settl thi disput __PUNCT__ with your vote __PUNCT__
that what our democraci is all about __PUNCT__

i want to hire outstand new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
we succeed in prevent student loan rate from doubl __PUNCT__ but we got more work to do to bring down colleg tuition cost to make it afford for everi young person __PUNCT__
i want to expand access to commun colleg for __NUM__ million more american so thei get train for the job that peopl ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
a higher educ is no longer a luxuri __PUNCT__
it is an econom imper in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it is part of what we need to succe in thi global economi __PUNCT__
and i go to fight for everi young person who is will to work hard to get an educ __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so on issu after issu __PUNCT__ there is a fundament differ __PUNCT__
on hous __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei sai let just let foreclosur happen __PUNCT__ and the market will bottom out __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that everi american who right now own a home can refin their home at histor low rate __PUNCT__ put __MONEY__ in the pocket of everi american __PUNCT__
not onli will you spend that and creat more custom for busi __PUNCT__ but it can also help stabil the hous market __PUNCT__
when it come to immigr __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei think that the arizona law should be __PUNCT__ a model for the nation __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i believ we a nation of law and a nation of immigr __PUNCT__
we work hard on border secur __PUNCT__
but i also said that when you got young peopl in thi countri who have been rais as american __PUNCT__ who believ in america __PUNCT__ then i want to give them a chanc to succe here in america __PUNCT__
it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
i don't want to go back to the dai when fight for the countri you love depend on who you love __PUNCT__
we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
we not go to go back there __PUNCT__
we not go to roll back wall street reform __PUNCT__
we know the cost when you got lax regul __PUNCT__ everybodi is affect __PUNCT__ everybodi pai a price __PUNCT__
and we ar not roll back health care reform __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
if you got health care __PUNCT__ the onli thing that now happen to you __PUNCT__ you not pai a tax __PUNCT__ the onli thing that happen to you is that you have more secur becaus insur compani can't jerk you around __PUNCT__
young peopl can stai on their parent plan until thei __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
senior ar go to see lower prescript drug price __PUNCT__
everybodi is go to get free prevent care __PUNCT__ includ women __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ insur compani can't charg women more than men now __PUNCT__
which remind me __PUNCT__ we not end fund for plan parenthood __PUNCT__
i think women should have control of their own health care choic just like men __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
if you don't have health care __PUNCT__ then we go to help you get it __PUNCT__
and the onli peopl who mai have a problem with thi law ar folk who can afford health care __PUNCT__ but aren't bui it __PUNCT__ wait until thei get sick __PUNCT__ and then go to the emerg room and expect everybodi els to pick up the tab __PUNCT__
that not respons __PUNCT__
that not consist with who we ar __PUNCT__
so we go to move forward on health care __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ which bring me to on last issu __PUNCT__ thi whole issu of deficit and debt __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the other side sai __PUNCT__ thi is the most import issu __PUNCT__ we concern for futur gener __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you ar truli concern about deficit and debt __PUNCT__ it puzzl that you would then propos a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that would give the averag millionair a __MONEY__ tax break __PUNCT__ and to pai for it you would then have to gut educ __PUNCT__ gut invest in scienc and research __PUNCT__ gut our transport spend __PUNCT__ voucher medicar __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ and in the process __PUNCT__ eventu __PUNCT__ you probabl go to have to rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
and i don't believ everi govern program work __PUNCT__
i don't believ that govern can help folk who don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
so we got to continu to make govern more effici and more effect and more custom __PUNCT__ friendli __PUNCT__ but we not go to turn back the clock to the dai when senior had to fend for themselv __PUNCT__ where poor children ar on their own __PUNCT__ where we not make invest in educ and fall further and further behind other countri __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so what i said is let ask folk like me __PUNCT__ who have been incred bless by thi countri __PUNCT__ to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what i said is __PUNCT__ i told congress last week __PUNCT__ let go ahead and sai everybodi who make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ your incom tax will not go up on dime __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
that includ __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__
but for folk like me __PUNCT__ we can afford to do a littl bit more to make sure we ar invest in america futur __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we tri that too __PUNCT__ austin __PUNCT__
a gui name bill clinton tri it __PUNCT__ and we took deficit and turn them into surplus __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ wealthi peopl did realli well also __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ if folk in the middl class ar do well __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
it that basic principl __PUNCT__
abraham lincoln said that there ar some thing we do better togeth __PUNCT__
we ar entrepreneur __PUNCT__ we ar risk taker __PUNCT__ we rug individualist __PUNCT__ but there ar some thing we do better togeth __PUNCT__
that how we financ the gi bill that creat the largest middl class in histori __PUNCT__
that how we built the hoover dam and the golden gate bridg __PUNCT__
that how we sent a man to the moon __PUNCT__
that how the internet came to happen __PUNCT__ becaus we recogn there ar some thing we do well togeth and we rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
and so here the good new __PUNCT__ is that in thi elect __PUNCT__ you will have an opportun to choos between these two vision __PUNCT__ and that the wai democraci should work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i will sai that there go to be about __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we __PUNCT__ who know how much monei is go to be spent __PUNCT__ we got folk write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ run neg ad with scari voic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and it basic the same messag everi time __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ thei got variat on a theme __PUNCT__ but basic __PUNCT__ these folk know thei can't sell those tire econom theori that didn't work last time __PUNCT__
so what thei go to do is just to sai __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it need to be __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ that what thei sai over and over again __PUNCT__ and thei just keep repeat it __PUNCT__ and thei hope it work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is a plan to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to grow the middl class __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and i got to sai __PUNCT__ i be pretti concern about it except for what you taught me __PUNCT__
what you taught me in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ what i learn in those earli campaign travel around the state and go to vfw hall and diner and sit in peopl live room __PUNCT__ listen to their stori __PUNCT__ what you taught me wa that when the american peopl focu and recogn the stake __PUNCT__ and when thei think back to the valu that propel their parent and their grandpar and their great __PUNCT__ grandpar forward in the face of veri difficult time __PUNCT__ those folk __PUNCT__ those gener who came here __PUNCT__ some as immigr __PUNCT__ some not of their own accord __PUNCT__ work in farm or ranch or factori or mill or mine __PUNCT__ when the american peopl tap into what is true and good __PUNCT__ that grit and determin and just neighborli that built thi countri __PUNCT__ you gui can't be stop __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter how much monei the other side spend __PUNCT__ you can't be stop __PUNCT__
and so the question go to be __PUNCT__ how bad do we want it __PUNCT__ how bad ar we will to work for it __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ how commit ar we to make sure that our kid get a great educ __PUNCT__ how commit ar we to make sure that social secur and medicar ar there for folk in the futur __PUNCT__ how commit ar we to make sure that our veteran __PUNCT__ who have serv us valiantli __PUNCT__ that we serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ how commit ar we to bring down our deficit in a balanc wai __PUNCT__ how commit ar we to continu to invest in scienc and research __PUNCT__ how commit ar we to that basic american bargain that sai if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ i tri to just make promis that i could keep __PUNCT__
and on of those promis __PUNCT__ i said to you __PUNCT__ i not a perfect man and i __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i promis __PUNCT__ talk to michel now __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ not a perfect man __PUNCT__
i said i wouldn't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but what i said wa that i would alwai tell you where i stood __PUNCT__ i alwai tell you what i thought __PUNCT__ and i would spend everi singl wake hour __PUNCT__ as long as i had the privileg of be your presid __PUNCT__ fight for you __PUNCT__ think about you __PUNCT__
becaus in you __PUNCT__ i saw me __PUNCT__
in you __PUNCT__ i saw my famili __PUNCT__
if i __PUNCT__ in your grandpar __PUNCT__ i saw my grandpar __PUNCT__
in your kid __PUNCT__ i see my kid __PUNCT__
becaus of you __PUNCT__ becaus of my faith in you __PUNCT__ through all the up and down __PUNCT__ i can sai i have kept that promis __PUNCT__
and if you still believ in me __PUNCT__ if you will to stand up with me __PUNCT__ if you will to knock on door for me and make phone call for me and talk to your friend and neighbor for me and mobil and organ __PUNCT__ then we will finish what we start in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and we will build thi middl class and grow thi economi so it work for everybodi __PUNCT__
and we will remind the world why the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__
god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
