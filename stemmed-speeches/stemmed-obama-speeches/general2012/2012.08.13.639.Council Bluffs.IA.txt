farmer __PUNCT__ rancher depend on a good crop season to pai the bill and put a roof over their head __PUNCT__
and i know thing ar tough right now __PUNCT__
the best wai to help these state is for the folk in congress to pass a farm bill that not onli help farmer and rancher respond to natur disast __PUNCT__ but also make some necessari reform and give farmer and rancher some long __PUNCT__ term certainti __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ right now too mani member of congress ar block the farm bill from becom law __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

so we got to be there for them __PUNCT__ not just todai __PUNCT__ but tomorrow __PUNCT__ and everi dai until thi drought pass __PUNCT__ becaus we ar american __PUNCT__
that what we do __PUNCT__ we take care of each other __PUNCT__
and when tough time strike our neighbor __PUNCT__ we give them a hand __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that speak to the larger idea of why i here __PUNCT__
the notion that i my brother keeper __PUNCT__ i my sister keeper __PUNCT__ the idea that we in thi togeth __PUNCT__ that wa at the heart of the journei that began here in iowa __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
we spent a lot of time on bu tour like thi on at school gym and famili farm and small busi across thi state __PUNCT__
although __PUNCT__ i have to sai the bu we had wasn't as nice as thi on __PUNCT__
we us to get some buse __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you know __PUNCT__ that campaign back in __NUM__ it had plenti of up and down __PUNCT__ but no matter what __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ the peopl of iowa __PUNCT__ had my back __PUNCT__
you had my back __PUNCT__
when the pundit had written us off __PUNCT__ when we were down in the poll __PUNCT__ you believ in me __PUNCT__ and i believ in you __PUNCT__
and it wa on your front porch and in your backyard where the movement for chang in thi countri began __PUNCT__
but our journei is not finish __PUNCT__ not yet __PUNCT__
i go to spend the next __NUM__ dai drive all across thi state just like i did in __NUM__ from council bluff to the quad citi __PUNCT__ becaus onc more __PUNCT__ you face a choic in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and that choic could not be bigger __PUNCT__
it is not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
more than ani other elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ vision of thi countri and the path that we have to take __PUNCT__
and the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth in __DATE__ is go to have an impact not just on your live __PUNCT__ but on your children live __PUNCT__ your grandchildren live __PUNCT__ for decad to come __PUNCT__
thi on count __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ think __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
think about thi __PUNCT__ council bluff __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ it wa independ and some republican __PUNCT__ becaus we understood that we need to restor the basic bargain that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ the basic deal that creat the greatest middl class and the most prosper economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and it a simpl bargain __PUNCT__
it sai __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ your work should be reward __PUNCT__
if you act respons and you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ have a home you can call your own __PUNCT__ count on health care when you get sick __PUNCT__ put awai enough to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and most of all __PUNCT__ give your kid an educ that allow them to dream even bigger than you did and do even better than you did __PUNCT__
that the american promis __PUNCT__ that the american dream __PUNCT__
and the reason we came togeth wa becaus we had seen a decad in which that dream wa be betrai __PUNCT__
we had gone through a decad where job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__ where you were work harder __PUNCT__ but make less __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from health care to a colleg educ kept on go up __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and so we knew that restor the basic bargain that made thi countri wa not go to be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it would take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the crisi hit and we saw friend and neighbor lose their job or lose their home __PUNCT__ lose their save __PUNCT__ push the american dream even further out of reach for too mani work peopl __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we seen america grit __PUNCT__
you folk ar tougher than ani tough time __PUNCT__
when we get knock down __PUNCT__ we stand back up __PUNCT__
some worker lost their job __PUNCT__ thei went back to commun colleg __PUNCT__ got retrain __PUNCT__ and now got a new job __PUNCT__
small busi kept their door open by hook or by crook __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ slowli __PUNCT__ we seen 4½ million new job creat __PUNCT__ half a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__ the most sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ the most sinc the 1990 __PUNCT__
and what we realiz wa that no matter how bad the crisi wa __PUNCT__ on thing did not chang __PUNCT__
and that is the charact of the american peopl and the resili of the american peopl __PUNCT__
and what hasn't chang is our determin to do what we came togeth in __NUM__ to do __PUNCT__ and that is to make sure that in america hard work pai off so that no matter who you ar or where you come from or what you look like __PUNCT__ you can make it here in america if you try __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i told you __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago i said __PUNCT__ there aren't go to be quick fix __PUNCT__ there won't be easi solut __PUNCT__
the challeng we face had been build up for decad __PUNCT__
and that still true todai __PUNCT__
but i want everybodi to know that we have the capac to meet everi challeng __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__ the best research in the world __PUNCT__ the best scientist in the world __PUNCT__
we still a young nation __PUNCT__
we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__
peopl come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
thei want to be here __PUNCT__
so whatev the naysay mai sai or folk who try to make thing look dark __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
what hold us back right now is washington polit __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you got folk on the other side who think compromis is a dirti word and whose main idea is to go back to the same old top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
thi weekend __PUNCT__ my oppon __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ chose as hi run mate the ideolog leader of the republican in congress __PUNCT__
and i got to tell you __PUNCT__ i know congressman ryan __PUNCT__
he a good man __PUNCT__ he a famili man __PUNCT__
he is an articul spokesman for governor romnei vision __PUNCT__
but the problem is that vision is on that i fundament disagre with __PUNCT__
governor romnei and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei think that if we just get rid of more regul on big corpor and give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ if we end medicar as we know it __PUNCT__ make it a voucher system __PUNCT__ then somehow thi is all go to lead to job and prosper for everybodi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of mr __PUNCT__ romnei entir econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the veri wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ an independ studi __PUNCT__ not by me __PUNCT__ but by independ economist __PUNCT__ said that governor romnei plan would actual rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__ apiec __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi wouldn't be done __PUNCT__ not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
it not go to be done to creat job or put folk back to work rebuild our road or bridg or school __PUNCT__
thi is you gui pai an extra __MONEY__ to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to folk who ar make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
doe thi sound familiar to you __PUNCT__ thei have tri to sell us thi trickl __PUNCT__ down theori befor __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ everi time it been tri __PUNCT__ it ha not work __PUNCT__
it did not work then __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__
it won't creat job __PUNCT__ it won't lower our deficit __PUNCT__
it is not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
we do not need more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
we need tax relief for work famili __PUNCT__
you need tax relief __PUNCT__ folk who ar try to rais kid and keep them healthi and put a roof over their head and send them to colleg __PUNCT__
and that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that the reason i run again __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that exactli what i done __PUNCT__
the averag work famili here in iowa and across the countri ha seen their tax rate go down about __MONEY__
so when you see __PUNCT__ when you hear the other side talk about democrat rais your tax __PUNCT__ your tax ar lower sinc i been presid __PUNCT__
that the truth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i want to keep your tax right where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ is __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax go up by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
nineti __PUNCT__ seven percent of small busi will not see their tax go up __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ council bluff __PUNCT__
thi is import __PUNCT__ if __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
and omaha __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and omaha __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__
didn't want to leav our nebraska folk left out here __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ if you lucki enough and fortun enough and been bless enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still get a tax cut for your first __MONEY__ of incom __PUNCT__
all we sai is __PUNCT__ after that __PUNCT__ mayb you can do a littl bit more to help pai down thi deficit and invest in thing like educ that help our economi grow __PUNCT__
and listen __PUNCT__ govern is go to do it part __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar of save __PUNCT__ of spend __PUNCT__
we go to cut more __PUNCT__
we got to streamlin govern and make it work effici and effect __PUNCT__
but what we also can do is just ask folk like me to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
and all we ask is for folk like me to go back to the rate that we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that wa a time when we creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and we creat the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__
and here the kicker __PUNCT__ folk at the top actual did well becaus __PUNCT__ guess what __PUNCT__ when a factori worker or a construct worker or a receptionist or a teacher or a firefight or a cop __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
mayb thei go out and bui a new car __PUNCT__ after have been drive that old beater around for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
mayb thei final get the new dishwash becaus the old on ha been broke for a long time __PUNCT__
mayb thei go bui a comput for their kid for the new school year or thei go to a restaur or __PUNCT__ heaven forbid __PUNCT__ thei take a vacat __PUNCT__
and that mean busi suddenli have more custom __PUNCT__
and then busi start hire more worker becaus thei make more profit __PUNCT__
and everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
that how we grow the economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl out and from the bottom out __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ across the board __PUNCT__ there is a sharp contrast between me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ more than a million job at stake __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i refus to turn my back on on of the great american industri __PUNCT__
i bet on american worker __PUNCT__
i bet on american manufactur __PUNCT__
three year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so now i want to make sure that high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur job ar take root here __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__
i want them to take root here in council bluff __PUNCT__
governor romnei __PUNCT__ he like to brag about hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__
a bunch of that privat sector experi wa invest in compani that have been call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ i want insourc __PUNCT__ not outsourc __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give tax break to compani that ar invest here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker to make american product to sell around the world __PUNCT__ stamp with those word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that what i believ in __PUNCT__
here anoth differ __PUNCT__
right now homegrown energi __PUNCT__ thing like wind energi __PUNCT__ creat new job all across the state like iowa __PUNCT__
and governor romnei want to end tax credit for wind energi produc __PUNCT__
america now produc twice as much electr from wind as we did befor i took offic __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of electr we produc with wind __PUNCT__
the wind industri support about __NUM__ job in iowa __PUNCT__
without these wind energi tax credit __PUNCT__ a whole lot of these job would be at risk __PUNCT__
thirti seven thousand job across thi countri would be at risk __PUNCT__
so i think we should stop spend billion on taxpay subsidi for an oil industri that is make all kind of profit __PUNCT__ and let keep invest in the clean energi that never been more promis __PUNCT__
that a disagr i got with governor romnei __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ i said it wa time to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
we end it __PUNCT__
i said it wa time for us to go after bin laden and al qaida __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
we set a timelin to start bring our troop out of afghanistan __PUNCT__
and so after a decad of war __PUNCT__ i think it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we could not have accomplish ani of thi without the extraordinari servic of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
and i promis you thi __PUNCT__ as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ thi countri will care for our veteran and serv our veteran as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi who ha fought for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that why we invest so heavili in make sure that the va is work the wai it suppos to __PUNCT__
that why we put more monei into treatment of ptsd and traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__ end homeless among veteran __PUNCT__
but those ar invest that we got to make __PUNCT__
and my plan sai __PUNCT__ let take half the monei that we no longer spend on war __PUNCT__
and let also us it to put peopl back to work build our road and our runwai and our port and our wireless network and creat a veteran job corp so local commun can hire our veteran to be firefight and polic offic in commun that need it __PUNCT__
that the america that we want to build __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that america onc again lead the world in educ our kid and train our worker __PUNCT__
i want to help our school hire and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg and learn the skill that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to get colleg and univers to bring down the cost of tuition onc and for all becaus higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__
it an econom necess in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
everybodi should be abl to afford it __PUNCT__
i got a plan to help homeown refin their home at histor low rate __PUNCT__ save an averag of __MONEY__
my oppon solut is to __PUNCT__ let the market bottom out __PUNCT__
that what he said __PUNCT__
that not a solut __PUNCT__ that part of the problem __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
my oppon sai on of the first thing he do is repeal obamacar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i think that part of be middl class in america is make sure you don't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ becaus of thi law __PUNCT__ if you got a preexist condit __PUNCT__ you be abl to get health insur __PUNCT__
that why __NUM__ million young peopl can now stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__
that why senior ar now get discount on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
that why insur compani can't drop your coverag or impos lifetim limit when you need it most __PUNCT__
it true __PUNCT__ obama doe care __PUNCT__
that why we pass thi bill __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we ar go forward __PUNCT__
all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it bring back manufactur __PUNCT__ creat more construct job __PUNCT__ protect peopl health care __PUNCT__ make sure your kid get the best educ __PUNCT__ make sure our veteran have the same kind of opportun my grandfath had when he came back from world war ii and wa abl to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ all these thing ar part of what make up a middl class life __PUNCT__
and thei all bound togeth in that idea that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that basic promis that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
it not alwai go to be smooth __PUNCT__
there ar go to be time where time ar tough __PUNCT__
but the basic idea that if you work hard and look after your famili __PUNCT__ that work is go to be reward __PUNCT__ that the promis that our parent and grandpar pass down to us __PUNCT__
and now it the promis we got to pass on to our kid and our grandkid __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you ar go to see the other side spend more monei on neg ad than we ever seen in histori __PUNCT__
and these folk __PUNCT__ thei got some realli rich peopl write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
and basic __PUNCT__ thei go to sai the same thing over and over again __PUNCT__
thei know their econom theori aren't go to sell becaus folk rememb what happen when we tri them __PUNCT__
so all thei go to sai is the economi is not as good as it should be and it obama fault __PUNCT__
and thei expect you to have amnesia and not rememb who it is that got us into the mess __PUNCT__
but thei figur __PUNCT__ if we run these ad often enough __PUNCT__ mayb folk will start kind of think about it __PUNCT__
that is true __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so thei mai have a plan to win the elect __PUNCT__ but thei can't hide the fact that thei don't have a plan to creat job or reviv the middl class or grow the economi __PUNCT__
and i do have that plan __PUNCT__
i got a plan that put you first __PUNCT__
i got a plan that put middl class famili and folk strive to get into the middl class first __PUNCT__
but i go to need your help __PUNCT__ i go to need your help __PUNCT__

the thing is __PUNCT__ we been outspent befor and we been count out befor __PUNCT__
but what you taught me in __NUM__ wa that when the american peopl cut through all the nonsens __PUNCT__ when you focu your attent and you rememb the stori of your own famili and all the struggl your parent and grandpar went through and how __PUNCT__ mayb becaus you got a student loan somewher or mayb becaus your dad wa abl to get that job at the factori __PUNCT__ you gui were abl to build a good life togeth __PUNCT__ just like michel and i were abl to get opportun that our parent could have never imagin __PUNCT__
when you focu on that thing that is best in america __PUNCT__ the wai we pull togeth and give everybodi a fair shot __PUNCT__ and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule and everybodi is take respons __PUNCT__ when you come togeth and reaffirm those core valu that make thi the greatest countri on earth __PUNCT__ you can't be stop __PUNCT__
all the monei those folk ar spend doesn't matter __PUNCT__
you ar our democraci __PUNCT__
you make decis about the direct of thi countri __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ we come too far to go back now __PUNCT__

we got more troop we got to bring home __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ we got more door of opportun that we got to open for everybodi who will to work hard enough to walk through those door __PUNCT__
