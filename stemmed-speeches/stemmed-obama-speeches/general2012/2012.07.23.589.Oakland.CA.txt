__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and becaus thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__ it had me think these dai __PUNCT__
you get a littl nostalg __PUNCT__ and you start think about your first polit campaign __PUNCT__ when i wa run as a state senat in illinoi and had to xerox my own flyer __PUNCT__ go to kinko __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and then michel and i would go out __PUNCT__ and we be knock on door on a saturdai morn __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ when i ran for the unit state senat __PUNCT__ i drive all across illinoi __PUNCT__ which isn't quit as big as california __PUNCT__ but is a big state __PUNCT__
and you didn't have gp back then __PUNCT__ and i didn't have marin on __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so i be drive myself __PUNCT__
sometim i have a staffer who would make me make phone call while i wa drive and __PUNCT__ which wa __PUNCT__ you not suppos to do anymor __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__
and sinc i didn't have gp __PUNCT__ we have those map that you actual had to fold __PUNCT__
young peopl wouldn't understand thi __PUNCT__ but you have to fold them and then fold them back again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i get lost __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ then onc i got to the event __PUNCT__ i have to park the car myself __PUNCT__
and sometim i couldn't find a park spot __PUNCT__ and so i end up be late __PUNCT__ and if it wa rain __PUNCT__ i have to fumbl with my umbrella __PUNCT__ and i come in kind of drench __PUNCT__
but i have such good memori about those campaign becaus what inspir me wherev i went __PUNCT__ i be in inner citi or rural commun __PUNCT__ you see folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ rich __PUNCT__ poor __PUNCT__ urban __PUNCT__ suburban __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ straight __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__ wherev we went __PUNCT__ there would be a common thread to peopl stori __PUNCT__
so i meet an elderli veteran __PUNCT__ and he remind me of my grandfath who fought in world war ii __PUNCT__
he wa a man who grew up dure the depress and serv hi countri and __PUNCT__ when he came home __PUNCT__ wa reward with a chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
and i think about my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who while my grandfath wa gone __PUNCT__ alreadi had my mom __PUNCT__ wa a babi __PUNCT__ and wa rosi the rivet __PUNCT__ she work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when thei marri __PUNCT__ after my grandfath came back __PUNCT__ thei were abl to get a home with the help of an fha loan __PUNCT__
and if i met a work coupl __PUNCT__ i think about michel parent __PUNCT__ especi her dad __PUNCT__ who almost never miss a dai of work at the water filtrat plant where he work __PUNCT__ a blue __PUNCT__ collar job __PUNCT__ even though he had ms __PUNCT__
so he need two cane to walk __PUNCT__ and he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els just to punch in on time __PUNCT__
but he wouldn't miss work __PUNCT__
and michel mom work as a secretari __PUNCT__
but even though thei didn't have a lot __PUNCT__ thei were abl to support a famili __PUNCT__ and michel and her brother end up get a great educ and would be abl to go as far as their dream would take them __PUNCT__
and then i meet a singl mom somewher __PUNCT__ and i think about my own mom __PUNCT__ who rais my sister and me __PUNCT__ with the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__ becaus my dad left when i wa a babi __PUNCT__
and my mom didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ but she work hard __PUNCT__
and she went to school at the same time as she work __PUNCT__ all so that she could give her two kid the best educ possibl __PUNCT__
and so the peopl that i meet in these campaign __PUNCT__ these earli campaign of mine __PUNCT__ and what i experienc ever sinc as i travel around the countri __PUNCT__ is that as differ as those folk seem on the surfac __PUNCT__ despit have all these differ background __PUNCT__ despit the fact that some were republican and some were democrat and some were independ __PUNCT__ all of them share thi belief that at the core of the american experi that bind us togeth __PUNCT__ the idea that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ thi place __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__ is a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
thi is a place where hard work allow you to achiev your dream __PUNCT__
we don't expect handout as american __PUNCT__ but we do expect hard work to pai off __PUNCT__
we expect respons to be reward __PUNCT__
we believ that if you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill and support a famili __PUNCT__
you should be abl to bui your own home and count on health care if you get sick and retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and most of all __PUNCT__ that you should be abl to give your children an educ that give them an even better shot than you had __PUNCT__
and we here todai for the same reason that so mani of us came togeth in __NUM__ becaus thi basic bargain __PUNCT__ thi core american dream __PUNCT__ is at risk __PUNCT__
and it been at risk like never befor __PUNCT__
for more than a decad befor i wa sworn in __PUNCT__ it had been slip awai from too mani hard __PUNCT__ work peopl __PUNCT__
job in factori were ship oversea __PUNCT__
folk at the top were do better than ever __PUNCT__ but middl class famili saw their paycheck get smaller __PUNCT__ saw their big __PUNCT__ their bill get bigger __PUNCT__
and in washington __PUNCT__ trillion were spent on two war and two tax cut that took us from record surplus to record deficit __PUNCT__ while on wall street a cultur of anyth goe led to the worst financi and econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
ever sinc i first ran for thi offic __PUNCT__ i said that it will take more than on year or on term or even on presid to restor the dream that thi countri built __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ the crisi that we went through made it that much harder __PUNCT__
but for those cynic who sai that our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ thei haven't wit the everydai courag and the charact of the american peopl __PUNCT__
thei have not met the small __PUNCT__ busi owner in minnesota who chose to sacrific some of their own perk and pai just to avoid lai off a singl worker dure the recess __PUNCT__
thei haven't met those folk in the auto plant in michigan and ohio that were never suppos to build anoth car again __PUNCT__ but now thei can't build them fast enough __PUNCT__
thei haven't talk to the factori worker that i meet in north carolina or ohio __PUNCT__ in their fifti sometim __PUNCT__ decid that when on industri left town __PUNCT__ thei go back to school __PUNCT__
on woman i met __PUNCT__ she start go back to commun colleg to studi biotech __PUNCT__
she wa in her mid __PUNCT__ fifti __PUNCT__
so she sit there with all these kid __PUNCT__
and i talk to her about why she decid to go back to school __PUNCT__
she said __PUNCT__ not onli do i expect that thi will help me get a job __PUNCT__ but also becaus __PUNCT__ she said __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that my kid know never to give up on their dream __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ oakland __PUNCT__ there ar no quick fix __PUNCT__ there ar no easi solut to some of the challeng we face __PUNCT__ but there is no doubt that we have the capac to meet them __PUNCT__
we got the world best worker __PUNCT__ the world best entrepreneur __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist __PUNCT__
we got the best research __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers __PUNCT__
we ar a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu that come from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__ you can see it here in oakland __PUNCT__
no matter what the naysay tell us __PUNCT__ there is not a countri on thi earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so i continu to feel as optimist __PUNCT__ as hope about the capac for us to institut meaning chang __PUNCT__ as i ever have been __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai right now despit all the progress we made __PUNCT__ despit the health care bill that we pass __PUNCT__ despit wall street reform __PUNCT__ despit save the auto industri __PUNCT__ despit all that __PUNCT__ what hold us back right now is not the lack of big idea __PUNCT__ it what go on in washington __PUNCT__ thi uncompromis view that the onli path forward is to go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

that what mitt romnei believ __PUNCT__
that what hi alli in washington believ __PUNCT__
but here the problem __PUNCT__ we tri that __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
it not what you believ __PUNCT__ it not what i believ __PUNCT__ it not what most american believ will actual make a differ __PUNCT__
thi countri wa not built from the top down __PUNCT__ it wa built from the middl class out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that how we becam the most prosper nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
that the path that you can choos for america in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so we got two contrast vision for where we want to take the countri __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ the other side know thei can't sell their idea __PUNCT__ so what thei go to do is try to distort my vision __PUNCT__
earlier todai governor romnei wa at it again __PUNCT__ knowingli twist my word around to suggest that i don't valu small busi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ in polit __PUNCT__ we all toler a certain amount of spin __PUNCT__
i understand these ar the game that get plai in polit campaign __PUNCT__ although when folk just __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ omit entir sentenc of what you said __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei start kind of splice and dice __PUNCT__ you mai have gone a littl over the edg there __PUNCT__
but look __PUNCT__ there actual a real choic at stake here __PUNCT__
i believ with all my heart that it is the drive and the ingenu of american who start busi that lead to their success __PUNCT__
i alwai have __PUNCT__ and i alwai will __PUNCT__
the abil for somebodi who will to work hard __PUNCT__ put in their sweat and their sacrific to turn their idea into a profit busi __PUNCT__ that the natur of america __PUNCT__
that what help make our economi the envi of the world __PUNCT__
i alwai said don't bet against american worker __PUNCT__ don't bet against american ingenu __PUNCT__
and i believ that the free market is the greatest sourc of prosper in our histori __PUNCT__
but i also believ that if you talk to ani busi owner __PUNCT__ thei tell you that what also help them succe __PUNCT__ alongsid all their hard work __PUNCT__ all their great idea __PUNCT__ is the abil to hire worker with the right skill and educ __PUNCT__
what help them succe is the abil to ship and sell their product on new road and bridg and port and wireless network __PUNCT__
what help them succe is have access to cut __PUNCT__ edg technolog __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ like the internet __PUNCT__ often start with publicli fund research and develop __PUNCT__
and what help them succe is a strong and grow middl class who can bui the product that thei sell __PUNCT__
everi busi need custom __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ for two centuri __PUNCT__ we made these invest __PUNCT__ not as democrat or republican __PUNCT__ but as american who understand what it take to give our peopl and our busi the best possibl chanc at success __PUNCT__
but my oppon disagre __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan is to gut these invest __PUNCT__ just so that he can give more tax break to millionair and compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
he think that the best wai to grow the economi __PUNCT__

like i said __PUNCT__ thei don't realli have an econom plan __PUNCT__
thei know their econom theori is not go to sell __PUNCT__
so realli what their ad all boil down to is __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it should be __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
it veri simpl __PUNCT__ easi to summar __PUNCT__
you will continu to see a variat on thi theme __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i guess it mai be a plan to try to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to revit the economi __PUNCT__
it not a plan to rebuild our middl class __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ the nice thing is __PUNCT__ as i see all of you here tonight __PUNCT__ it remind that we been outspent befor __PUNCT__
we been count out more time than i can rememb __PUNCT__
but through everi on of my campaign __PUNCT__ what alwai given me hope is you __PUNCT__ your abil to cut through the nonsens __PUNCT__ your abil to focu on what import __PUNCT__
when american come togeth and thei focu on what true and thei focu on what right and thei think about what best in the stori of their own famili __PUNCT__ all the struggl their parent and grandpar went through __PUNCT__ some come here as immigr __PUNCT__ some come here through no choic of their own __PUNCT__ some work in mill or factori __PUNCT__ some work out on farm __PUNCT__ folk come here and not know what to expect __PUNCT__ but understand there wa someth special about america __PUNCT__ know that here there wa embed in the veri charter of thi countri the idea that everybodi had certain inalien right __PUNCT__ endow by their creator __PUNCT__ life and liberti and the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__ the idea that we free to pursu our own individu dream __PUNCT__ and yet __PUNCT__ even as we express thi incred self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__ thi rug individu __PUNCT__ that we can also come togeth as on american famili __PUNCT__ as a more perfect union __PUNCT__
our parent __PUNCT__ our grandpar __PUNCT__ our great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ what thei were fight for __PUNCT__ thei knew that the middl class __PUNCT__ it wasn't about a certain amount of monei in your bank account __PUNCT__ it wa about know that you work hard and you could succe and you could have some secur and your kid could leapfrog over you __PUNCT__ do thing you couldn't imagin __PUNCT__
and that there would be time where we stumbl and had setback __PUNCT__ but in america __PUNCT__ you got a second chanc and a third chanc __PUNCT__ as long as you just didn't give up __PUNCT__ you kept on go __PUNCT__
when we tap that spirit __PUNCT__ when we tap into that idea that it not a matter of bloodlin __PUNCT__ it not a matter of everybodi be of the same race or the same faith __PUNCT__ but it ha to do with a creed that bind us togeth __PUNCT__ when we focu on that __PUNCT__ then all thi other monei doesn't matter __PUNCT__
all those neg ad don't matter __PUNCT__
what matter is you __PUNCT__
when you come togeth __PUNCT__ chang happen __PUNCT__
