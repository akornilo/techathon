and i get lost __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ onc i got to an event __PUNCT__ i have to find park __PUNCT__ and sometim __PUNCT__ i couldn't find a park spot __PUNCT__ or i get rain on __PUNCT__
but i have such fond memori of those earli campaign becaus __PUNCT__ no matter where i went __PUNCT__ no matter what commun __PUNCT__ inner __PUNCT__ citi __PUNCT__ rural town __PUNCT__ meet with black folk __PUNCT__ white folk __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ didn't matter what background peopl came from __PUNCT__ no matter how much thei look differ on the surfac __PUNCT__ there wa a common thread to all the stori that i heard as i travel around the state __PUNCT__
i meet an elderli coupl __PUNCT__ and thei remind me of my grandpar __PUNCT__
i think about my grandfath who fought in patton armi in world war ii __PUNCT__ my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line while he wa gone __PUNCT__
and when he came back __PUNCT__ he wa reward with a chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
thei were abl to bui their first home with an fha loan __PUNCT__
and i think about the journei that thei had travel and everyth that that greatest gener had done to build america __PUNCT__
or i meet a middl class coupl __PUNCT__ and i think about michel parent __PUNCT__ especi her dad __PUNCT__ who had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ so by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__ had to us two cane __PUNCT__ had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els to get to work becaus that how long it took to get him dress __PUNCT__ but would not miss a dai of work __PUNCT__
and i think about michel mom __PUNCT__ who end up work as a secretari for most of her life and how __PUNCT__ despit the fact that thei never had a lot __PUNCT__ thei were abl to give michel and michel brother the best educ possibl __PUNCT__ and how remark that wa __PUNCT__ thi countri that we live in __PUNCT__
and then i meet a singl mom and i think about my own mother __PUNCT__ who rais my sister and me __PUNCT__ with the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__ becaus my dad left when i wa a babi __PUNCT__
and my mom didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ but she work hard and she went to school at the same time so that she could give her two children the best educ possibl and thei could travel on a path that she couldn't have even imagin __PUNCT__
so the peopl i met in that first campaign and everi campaign sinc __PUNCT__ thei had all kind of differ stori __PUNCT__ all kind of differ background __PUNCT__ thei were young and old and everi race and everi faith __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ straight __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ but all of them share the belief in that core american experi __PUNCT__ that basic idea __PUNCT__ that core bargain that make us the shine exampl for the world __PUNCT__ the idea that no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ america is a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we don't expect handout __PUNCT__ but we expect hard work to pai off __PUNCT__
we understand there will be setback __PUNCT__ but we also know that respons should be reward __PUNCT__
we believ that if you put enough effort into it __PUNCT__ enough elbow greas into it __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ you should be abl to have a home that you call your own __PUNCT__ health care that you can count on if you get sick __PUNCT__
you should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
you should be abl to provid your children with an educ that give them an even better shot than you had __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
jacksonvil __PUNCT__ we ar here todai becaus we recogn that thi basic bargain __PUNCT__ thi essenc of who we ar as a peopl __PUNCT__ thi simpl american dream is at risk like never befor __PUNCT__
for more than a decad __PUNCT__ it had been slip awai from too mani hard __PUNCT__ work peopl __PUNCT__
job and factori were ship oversea __PUNCT__
folk at the top were do better than ever befor __PUNCT__ but middl class famili saw their paycheck get smaller even as their bill got bigger __PUNCT__
in washington __PUNCT__ the trillion that were spent on two war and two tax cut took us from record surplus to record deficit __PUNCT__
and on wall street __PUNCT__ a cultur of anyth goe led to the worst econom crisi and financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ever sinc i first ran for thi offic __PUNCT__ i said it go to take more than __NUM__ year or on term or mayb even on presid to restor the dream that built thi countri __PUNCT__
and the financi crisi and econom crisi made our job that much harder __PUNCT__
but i don't get discourag __PUNCT__ becaus the cynic who sai that our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ thei haven't wit the everydai courag and the essenti charact of the american peopl __PUNCT__
thei haven't met the small busi owner in minnesota who chose to sacrific some of their own perk __PUNCT__ some of their own pai __PUNCT__ to avoid lai off a singl worker dure that recess __PUNCT__
thei haven't been to the auto compani in michigan and ohio that were never suppos to build anoth car again __PUNCT__ but now thei can't build them fast enough __PUNCT__
thei haven't talk to the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old factori worker from north carolina who decid that when the furnitur industri left town she get her degre in biotechnolog from the local commun colleg __PUNCT__ not just becaus she hope it get her a job __PUNCT__ but becaus she hope it tell her children __PUNCT__ you don't give up on your dream __PUNCT__
that the charact i seen in the american peopl __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
there ar no easi fix __PUNCT__ no quick solut to the challeng we face __PUNCT__ but there is no doubt in my mind that we have the capac to meet them and we will meet them __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world and the best entrepreneur in the world and the best scientist in the world and the best research and the best colleg and the best univers __PUNCT__
we a young nation with the greatest divers and talent and ingenu from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
and florida know someth about that __PUNCT__
no matter what the naysay tell us __PUNCT__ there is not a countri on earth that would not happili trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so the problem __PUNCT__ what stand in our wai is not technic solut to the problem of hous or educ or deal with the debt __PUNCT__
we know how to deal with it __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai is our polit __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

thi countri wa built from the middl class out __PUNCT__
it wa built from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that how we becam the most prosper nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__

you on your own __PUNCT__
on independ nonpartisan studi found that senior would have to pai nearli __MONEY__ more for medicar than thei do todai __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ that the wrong wai to go __PUNCT__
it wrong to ask senior to pai more for medicar just so millionair and billionair can pai less in tax __PUNCT__
that not the wai to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be squeez more monei out of senior who ar just bare get by right now __PUNCT__
my plan is to squeez more monei out of the health care system by elimin wast and go after abus and fraud in medicar __PUNCT__
we can cut back govern spend that we can't afford __PUNCT__ but i will also ask anybodi who is make over __MONEY__ a year to just go back to the rate thei were pai under bill clinton __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ that work __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i refus to turn my back on a great industri and on american worker __PUNCT__
i bet on american worker __PUNCT__
i bet on american manufactur __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so i want to make sure that the high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ not just in the auto industri __PUNCT__ but in everi industri __PUNCT__ that those advanc manufactur job ar take root not in china __PUNCT__ not in germani __PUNCT__ but in jacksonvil and in cleveland and in raleigh and in richmond __PUNCT__
governor romnei experi ha been own compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ in the busi of outsourc __PUNCT__ want to give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that ar invest here in the unit state __PUNCT__ reward compani that ar invest here and hire american worker __PUNCT__ so we can sell product around the world stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__

it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__

we have set a timelin to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ thi countri will care for our veteran and serv our veteran as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
so my plan would take about half the monei that we no longer spend on war and us that to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__ us the other half to put peopl back to work rebuild our road __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ our runwai __PUNCT__ our port __PUNCT__ wireless network __PUNCT__

and becaus we pass the health care law __PUNCT__ we ar go to realiz that goal __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__

thei all central to the idea that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ that promis that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
it the same promis our parent and grandpar pass down to all of us __PUNCT__ the promis we have to pass down to our kid and our grandkid __PUNCT__ the idea that we work hard __PUNCT__ that everybodi ha got to take respons __PUNCT__ that govern can't solv everi problem and it certainli can't solv problem if you don't want to help yourself __PUNCT__
but we also know there ar some thing we do better togeth __PUNCT__ that we rise or fall as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
over the cours of the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side will spend more monei than we have ever seen in our lifetim on ad that tell you the same thing you been hear for month __PUNCT__

so thei don't have a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
everyth thei propos we tri for a decad __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
so thei don't have a plan __PUNCT__ and i do __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ i been outspent befor __PUNCT__ and i been count out befor __PUNCT__ but through everi campaign __PUNCT__ what ha alwai given me hope is the american peopl __PUNCT__
you have the abil to cut through all that nonsens __PUNCT__
what give me hope is that you rememb the stori of famili just like mine __PUNCT__ all the struggl of parent and great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ and some folk come here as immigr __PUNCT__ some brought here in chain __PUNCT__ some work on the farm __PUNCT__ some work in the mine or on the mill __PUNCT__ thei didn't know what to expect __PUNCT__ but thei understood that there wa someth differ about thi countri __PUNCT__
thei knew that thi wa a countri where thing might not be perfect __PUNCT__ but work togeth __PUNCT__ we could perfect our union __PUNCT__ where peopl were free to pursu their own individu dream __PUNCT__ but still come togeth as neighbor __PUNCT__ as friend __PUNCT__ as on american famili __PUNCT__
thei knew that be middl class wasn't about how much you had in your bank account __PUNCT__ it wa about the secur of know you could take care of your famili and give your kid the chanc to pursu the life that thei dream of and the chanc to give someth back to thi countri that gave you so much __PUNCT__
