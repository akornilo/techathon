now __PUNCT__ the reason thi campaign is so intens is becaus the choic that we go to be face in __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__
thi is not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
it is a choic about two fundament differ vision for where we go in the futur __PUNCT__ two fundament differ path for our countri __PUNCT__

it will impact america for decad to come __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
that why we vote for you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we all came togeth __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ but we also had independ __PUNCT__ we had some republican __PUNCT__ to restor the basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__ that made us into an econom powerhous __PUNCT__
it wa a bargain __PUNCT__ it wa a deal that sai if you work hard here in america __PUNCT__ you should be reward for that work __PUNCT__
it a deal that sai if you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ if you act respons __PUNCT__ then you should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you should be abl to afford a home that you call your own __PUNCT__
you should be abl to count on health care when you get sick __PUNCT__
you should be abl to put awai enough to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ you should be abl to give your children the kind of educ that allow them to dream even bigger and do more than you could ever imagin __PUNCT__
it a simpl promis __PUNCT__
it a promis that i live out in my life and michel ha live out in her __PUNCT__
it is __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we love michel __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i know you all love michel __PUNCT__
it is the promis that at the heart of thi countri __PUNCT__ thi idea that here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
and it had been slip awai for almost a decad __PUNCT__
we had seen sluggish job growth and job get ship oversea __PUNCT__ and your incom were flat or go down __PUNCT__ cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__
and it culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we knew that restor that american dream would not be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it wa go to take more than on year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the middl class got hammer by thi recess __PUNCT__ and we saw million of our friend and neighbor get hurt __PUNCT__ lose home __PUNCT__ lose job __PUNCT__
but over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we work to make progress __PUNCT__ 4½ million new job creat __PUNCT__ half a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__
thei count the auto industri out __PUNCT__ and now it is come back stronger than ever __PUNCT__ right here in ohio and all across the countri __PUNCT__
we pass health care so you could have secur if you get sick __PUNCT__
we pass reform to make sure that wall street could not act in the same reckless manner that almost brought the economi to it knee __PUNCT__
we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
and we take care of our veteran __PUNCT__ becaus if you fought for thi countri __PUNCT__ you should not have to fight for a job or a roof over your head when you come home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we still have a long wai to go __PUNCT__
but there on thing that thi crisi ha not chang __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang our charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what make us great __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what brought us togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we just feel a greater sens of urgenc about it __PUNCT__
our first order of busi ha been to recov the job and the wealth that wa lost in thi crisi __PUNCT__
but we not go to stop there __PUNCT__
we go to reclaim the financi secur that been slip awai for more than a decad __PUNCT__
our job isn't just to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
we want an economi where that work pai off __PUNCT__ so that no matter who you ar or what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ fight for the middl class and grow our middl class __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar no quick fix or easi solut to the challeng we face __PUNCT__
but there is no doubt in my mind we got the capac to meet them __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research __PUNCT__ the best colleg __PUNCT__ and the best univers __PUNCT__
we ar still a young nation __PUNCT__ we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__
peopl want to come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so no matter how tough thing get __PUNCT__ thi is not a countri that quit __PUNCT__
there isn't a countri on earth that wouldn't gladli chang place with us __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai right now is not the lack of good idea __PUNCT__
what stand in our wai is our polit __PUNCT__
we got a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
we got republican in congress who have clung to the view __PUNCT__ the uncompromis view __PUNCT__ that the onli wai to move ahead is to go back to the same __PUNCT__ tire solut that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei got a basic theori __PUNCT__ i call it top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
and the basic idea is __PUNCT__ is that if you give more tax break to the veri wealthi and you get rid of regul on bank and pollut and health insur compani __PUNCT__ then somehow everybodi is go to prosper __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ you know better __PUNCT__
we tri that __PUNCT__
it did not work __PUNCT__
america is not built from the top down __PUNCT__
america is built from the middl out __PUNCT__
america is built from the bottom up __PUNCT__
america is built by farmer and factori worker and small busi and compani that send american product oversea __PUNCT__ not job oversea __PUNCT__
that the countri we fight for __PUNCT__
that the economi that we need to build togeth __PUNCT__
and we ar not go to get there do the same kind of stuff that these folk ar talk about now __PUNCT__
we not go to get there if we spend more monei on tax cut for folk like me who don't need them and we not even ask for them __PUNCT__
and yet the centerpiec of my oppon entir econom plan is not onli to extend the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ but then to add a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut on top of it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the bulk of thi would go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
a lot of it would go to the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
pai attent here __PUNCT__
folk make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ the top on __PUNCT__ tenth of __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ thei would get a tax cut under mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan that is worth almost a quarter of a million dollar __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ thei would save under hi plan __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
hold on __PUNCT__ it get wors __PUNCT__
my oppon sai he go to pai for thi __MONEY__ trillion plan __PUNCT__ but under thi plan __PUNCT__ guess who get the bill for these __MONEY__ tax cut __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you do __PUNCT__
and you don't have to take my word for it __PUNCT__
just todai an independ __PUNCT__ nonpartisan organ __PUNCT__ thei crunch all the number __PUNCT__
thei look at hi plan __PUNCT__
thi wasn't me __PUNCT__ thi wasn't my team __PUNCT__
thi wa an independ group __PUNCT__
on of the gui who did the analysi us to work for bush __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so thei found that if governor romnei want to keep hi word and pai for hi plan __PUNCT__ of thi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ the onli wai to do it is to cut tax break that you __PUNCT__ middl class famili __PUNCT__ depend on __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the home mortgag deduct you us to pai for your home __PUNCT__
the health care deduct that your employ us to provid you health care __PUNCT__
some of the tax credit we put in place to send your kid to colleg __PUNCT__
what thi mean is the averag middl class famili with children would be hit with a tax increas of more than __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think a lot of peopl ar will to sacrific to bring down the deficit __PUNCT__ to defend our countri __PUNCT__
but he not ask you to contribut more to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__
he not ask you to do it to invest __PUNCT__ at thi point __PUNCT__ an audienc member collaps __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
i sure thei okai __PUNCT__
sometim folk faint becaus thei been stand too long __PUNCT__
so we just need a paramed right here in the front __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it mean i been talk too long __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei be okai __PUNCT__ just give them space __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me make sure peopl understand thi __PUNCT__
thei ask you to pai an extra __MONEY__ not to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__ not to invest in our kid __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
romnei is ask you to pai more so that peopl like him get a tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
in order to afford __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ we can break it down further __PUNCT__
in order to afford just a tax cut for somebodi like mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ __NUM__ famili like your would have to pai anoth __MONEY__ in tax each year and everi year __PUNCT__
not just on year __PUNCT__ everi year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ doe that sound like a plan you can afford __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
how mani peopl like that plan __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
none __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
doe that sound like the kind of futur that our countri can afford __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ we do not need more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ we need tax cut for work american __PUNCT__
we need tax cut for famili who ar try to rais their kid __PUNCT__ and try to keep them healthi and try to send them to colleg and try to put a roof over their head __PUNCT__
we don't need tax break for compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ we need tax break for compani that ar invest here in akron __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so i got a differ plan __PUNCT__
i got a differ plan __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis middl class tax cut __PUNCT__ i kept that promis __PUNCT__
the typic famili is pai about __MONEY__ less in tax than thei were when i came into offic __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ let keep tax exactli where thei ar on the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of american do __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by on singl dime __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you been lucki or you been success __PUNCT__ so that you in the other __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ like i am __PUNCT__ all we ask is that we pai a littl bit more so that we can pai down our deficit and so we can invest in thing like educ that will help us grow __PUNCT__
and listen __PUNCT__ akron __PUNCT__ i don't believ govern can solv everi problem __PUNCT__
not everi govern program work __PUNCT__
govern can't help somebodi who doesn't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
so we cut thing that don't work __PUNCT__
i alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__
but we got to balanc that __PUNCT__
and i not go to pai for massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair by gut the invest that we need to keep the middl class strong __PUNCT__
i want to make sure we invest in hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that we put folk back to work rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ our airport __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that we invest in our commun colleg so thei can train peopl for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
i want to make sure we invest in basic scienc and research to keep our technolog edg __PUNCT__
and if we go to bring down our deficit and do those thing and make sure that medicar is there for our senior and make sure social secur is there for our senior __PUNCT__ then we got to make choic __PUNCT__
and all i ask is __PUNCT__ the folk like me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei go back to the rate that we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and if you rememb __PUNCT__ that wa when the economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ here the kicker __PUNCT__ it wa good for folk at the top too __PUNCT__
becaus here what happen __PUNCT__
when middl class folk and folk who ar work to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ when thei get a decent wage __PUNCT__ when their tax bill isn't too high __PUNCT__ thei got a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ and then thei go to the store __PUNCT__ and thei bui a new applianc __PUNCT__ or thei final get rid of that old beater and bui a new car __PUNCT__ and mayb a student bui a new comput __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ suddenli __PUNCT__ busi have custom __PUNCT__
and that how we make the economi grow __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ thi is a choic __PUNCT__
if you believ that mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan will make you better off __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if you believ it okai to just set our sight lower __PUNCT__ we can't afford to help young peopl go to colleg __PUNCT__ we can't afford to rebuild our road __PUNCT__ we can't afford basic research __PUNCT__ if you believ that __PUNCT__ then go ahead and send these folk to washington for the next few year __PUNCT__
