now __PUNCT__ i a big believ that educ start at home __PUNCT__
it start with parent who ar read to their kid and turn off the tv sometim __PUNCT__ instil a lifelong love of learn __PUNCT__
you can't replac that kind of attitud that you get at home __PUNCT__ and so parent have to make sure that thei stai on top of their kid __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__

but as import as parent ar __PUNCT__ as import as the attitud of student ar __PUNCT__ what happen at school like thi will shape the futur of the vast major of our kid __PUNCT__
what happen in the classroom matter __PUNCT__
and that begin with the person at the front of the classroom __PUNCT__
for week now __PUNCT__ teacher like claritssa across the countri have been work behind the scene __PUNCT__
thei been prepar their classroom __PUNCT__
thei been decor bulletin board __PUNCT__
thei been dig into their own pocket all too often to pai for school suppli __PUNCT__
i know becaus my sister is a teacher __PUNCT__ and i know how much effort thei put into thi __PUNCT__
thei don't ask for a lot of recognit __PUNCT__
thei certainli not go into teach for the monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei do it becaus thei care about children __PUNCT__
thei care about their futur __PUNCT__
i wa just meet with anoth teacher backstag who said teach is the closest you can get to immort __PUNCT__
and in fact __PUNCT__ in a meet that i had with teacher __PUNCT__ i had a chanc to meet with on teacher who wa an advis to claritssa when she wa a student __PUNCT__ so he had the opportun to see hi own student now do what he been do for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ what satisfact that must give you __PUNCT__
the right teacher can chang a child life forev __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ i know thi from person experi __PUNCT__
when i wa in fifth grade __PUNCT__ i had a teacher name mabel hefti __PUNCT__
that wa her name __PUNCT__ and she wa a great teacher __PUNCT__
she wa full of curios and she wa full of enthusiasm __PUNCT__
and most importantli __PUNCT__ she went that extra mile __PUNCT__
fifth grade can be a tough time for a kid __PUNCT__
and i wa differ and had a funni name __PUNCT__ and i had just come back from live a few year oversea with my mom and wasn't sure how i fit in __PUNCT__
and she notic that __PUNCT__ ms __PUNCT__ hefti __PUNCT__
and she took me under her wing __PUNCT__ and she made me feel like i had someth to sai and that i had some talent __PUNCT__
and she wasn't too obviou about it __PUNCT__ but she made sure that dure thi transit year __PUNCT__ i wa abl to steadi myself and start focus on my work __PUNCT__
i still rememb her all these year later __PUNCT__
she pass awai now __PUNCT__ but i still rememb her __PUNCT__
i onli stand here as presid becaus i had a bunch of great teacher like ms __PUNCT__ hefti __PUNCT__
teacher matter __PUNCT__
a good teacher can increas the lifetim incom of a classroom by more than a quarter million dollar __PUNCT__
a great teacher can chang the trajectori of a child life __PUNCT__
thei can offer an escap from poverti to a child who dream beyond hi or her circumst __PUNCT__
sometim a teacher can fill in where the parent isn't alwai there __PUNCT__
so thei on the front line of our countri futur __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ thi year __PUNCT__ fewer teacher ar go back to school __PUNCT__
sinc __DATE__ of __NUM__ even as we creat million of new job in the privat sector __PUNCT__ we lost more than __NUM__ teacher __PUNCT__ aid __PUNCT__ and staff in our school __PUNCT__ larg becaus of budget cut at the state and local level __PUNCT__
think about what that mean for our kid __PUNCT__
claritssa mention it __PUNCT__ crowd classroom __PUNCT__ cancel program for preschool __PUNCT__ less learn time __PUNCT__
here in clark counti __PUNCT__ the averag class size wa alreadi the largest in the countri last year __PUNCT__ thi year __PUNCT__ it get even bigger __PUNCT__
cut back on teacher is the last thing we should be do as a countri __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we should be hire more teacher __PUNCT__ especi in area like math and scienc where we need to be at the cut edg __PUNCT__
if we want america to lead in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we got to give all our children the best educ possibl __PUNCT__ from the dai thei start in preschool to the dai thei start their career __PUNCT__ becaus other countri ar race __PUNCT__ thei ar do everyth thei can to out __PUNCT__ educ us becaus thei know that mean thei be abl to out __PUNCT__ compet us __PUNCT__
thei know that new busi and new industri will take root and creat job wherev the best educ __PUNCT__ most highli skill worker ar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that young man probabl need a good teacher __PUNCT__
we all need it __PUNCT__
so busi ar go to locat where thei got the best worker __PUNCT__ the best educ __PUNCT__ the most highli skill worker __PUNCT__
and i want that place to be nevada __PUNCT__
i want that place to be clark counti __PUNCT__
i want that place to be the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and that why even as we face the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ i fought to keep teacher in the classroom __PUNCT__
the action that we took dure the first __NUM__ year of my administr help save the job of __NUM__ educ __PUNCT__
that made a differ for our kid __PUNCT__ it made a differ in our commun __PUNCT__
part of the job bill that i sent to the new congress last __DATE__ would have help state like nevada prevent further layoff __PUNCT__ would allow them to rehir teacher who have lost their job __PUNCT__
but republican in congress led __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
the republican in congress __PUNCT__ led by congressman ryan __PUNCT__ join togeth to block the bill that would have help state hire and retain more teacher __PUNCT__
and as a result __PUNCT__ ten of thousand of teacher ar not come back to school thi fall __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ not onli is that unfair to our kid __PUNCT__ it foolish for our futur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon in thi elect doesn't seem to understand thi __PUNCT__
governor romnei sai we got enough teacher __PUNCT__ we don't need anymor __PUNCT__
the wai he talk about them __PUNCT__ it seem as if he think these ar a bunch of nameless govern bureaucrat that we need to cut back on __PUNCT__ those ar hi word __PUNCT__
and hi econom plan certainli would do that __PUNCT__
the plan governor romnei ha put forward would cut america invest in educ by nearli __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ he not make these cut becaus he want to creat job or pai down the deficit __PUNCT__
he do it to pai for a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that weight toward the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so i got a question for governor romnei __PUNCT__ how mani teacher __PUNCT__ job ar worth anoth tax cut for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__ how mani kid in head start ar worth a tax cut for somebodi like me who doesn't need it __PUNCT__ how mani grant and loan for colleg student ar worth a tax cut for governor romnei __PUNCT__ who certainli doesn't need it __PUNCT__ we ar a better countri than on that short chang the next gener just so we can shower tax cut on folk who ar alreadi do realli well __PUNCT__
we a better countri than on that pull the rug out from under young peopl work so hard to make it just to give more to folk who alreadi got a lot __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not how we built the greatest economi and the strongest middl class in the world __PUNCT__
that not a plan for our futur __PUNCT__
that not where i want to take thi countri __PUNCT__
that why i run for reelect as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
governor romnei ha made hi time as an investor the basi for hi candidaci __PUNCT__
and hi econom plan make clear he doesn't think our children educ is worth invest in __PUNCT__
i do __PUNCT__
and that the choic thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__
when a teacher in west philadelphia __PUNCT__ somebodi on the front line of our educ system __PUNCT__ told governor romnei that have too mani kid in hi class made it harder for him to do hi job __PUNCT__ governor romnei told him that class size don't matter __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of studi that sai that class size do matter __PUNCT__ especi in the earli grade __PUNCT__
but more importantli __PUNCT__ why wouldn't we be listen to the teacher who ar actual in the classroom __PUNCT__ have you ever met a teacher who said __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ i have too few kid in my class __PUNCT__ i want a lot more kid __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ would ani parent want their kid to go to a school with much bigger class size __PUNCT__ claritssa wa tell me that in the first coupl of week of school __PUNCT__ she might have __NUM__ student in a class __PUNCT__
thei don't have enough desk __PUNCT__ so thei got some kid sit on the floor get assign __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ eventu __PUNCT__ the school district tri to work to level thing out __PUNCT__ but she sai even at that point __PUNCT__ she mai have __NUM__ __PUNCT__
anybodi ever try to be with __NUM__ __PUNCT__ or __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and some of them mai not be read at grade level __PUNCT__ some of them __PUNCT__ english mai be a second languag __PUNCT__
imagin how difficult that is __PUNCT__
so instead of listen to teacher or work with teacher __PUNCT__ governor romnei said the onli reason he would keep the depart of educ around is to push back against teacher __PUNCT__
he think that teacher need to have somebodi polic them and check them and that the main purpos of the depart of educ __PUNCT__
that like sai you keep the depart of agricultur around so you can push around farmer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the sad thing is __PUNCT__ educ should not be a democrat or a republican issu __PUNCT__
it an american issu __PUNCT__
it about what best for our kid __PUNCT__
and i haven't just talk the talk __PUNCT__ i walk the walk on thi __PUNCT__
over the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we broken through the tradit stalem that us to exist between the left and the right __PUNCT__ between conserv and liber __PUNCT__
we launch a nation competit to improv all our school __PUNCT__
we put more monei into it __PUNCT__ but we also demand reform __PUNCT__
we want teacher to be paid better and treat like the profession that thei ar __PUNCT__
but we also demand more account __PUNCT__ includ the abil of school district to replac teacher that aren't cut it __PUNCT__
for less than __NUM__ percent of what our nation spend on educ each year __PUNCT__ almost everi state ha now agre to rais standard for teach and learn __PUNCT__ and that the first time it happen in a gener __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ we work with democrat and republican to fix no child left behind __PUNCT__
so here in nevada __PUNCT__ a waiver ha been grant becaus we want high standard __PUNCT__ but we don't want teacher teach to the test __PUNCT__
we told governor and their state that if you will to set higher __PUNCT__ more honest standard for our kid __PUNCT__ we go to give you more flexibl to meet them __PUNCT__ becaus what work best in new york might not work as well in nevada and vice versa __PUNCT__
we know that when student aren't allow to walk awai from their educ __PUNCT__ more of them walk on that stage to get their diploma __PUNCT__
and that why i call on everi state to requir that their student stai in high school until thei graduat or turn __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and when kid do graduat __PUNCT__ the most daunt challeng can be the cost of colleg __PUNCT__
and that why we help over __NUM__ million more student afford a colleg educ with grant that go farther than befor __PUNCT__
we fought to make sure the interest rate on feder student loan didn't go up over the summer __PUNCT__
we won that fight __PUNCT__
we stood up to special interest and fix a student loan system that gave ten of billion of taxpay dollar to big bank __PUNCT__ and we us that monei to doubl grant aid to student __PUNCT__
governor romnei is on the wrong side of each of these issu __PUNCT__
hi plan would cut aid to __NUM__ million student __PUNCT__ turn student loan back over to big bank __PUNCT__ wast billion of dollar of taxpay monei __PUNCT__
when he wa ask __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what ar you go to do about the rise cost of tuition __PUNCT__ he wa ask thi by a student __PUNCT__ he just said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you need to go borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that not a plan __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
so let me just sai thi __PUNCT__
over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ it actual less than __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ it less than __NUM__ week __PUNCT__ not that i count __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we will see the other side spend more monei than we ever seen on ad __PUNCT__
and these aren't __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ posit ad where thei put out their plan __PUNCT__ becaus thei don't realli have a plan __PUNCT__
and the plan thei got won't work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so what thei do is thei will run these ad over and over again just sai the economi is not where it should be and it all obama fault __PUNCT__
and that the onli argument thei have becaus thei know their econom plan is not popular __PUNCT__
thei know that gut educ to pai for massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__ that not go to be popular among voter __PUNCT__
so thei count on the fact that __PUNCT__ after watch so mani of these ad everi dai __PUNCT__ you will get so discourag that you decid your vote doesn't matter __PUNCT__
you decid you can't compet with some rich gui write a __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ vega __PUNCT__ i count on someth differ __PUNCT__
claritssa is count on someth differ __PUNCT__
the student at thi school ar count on someth differ __PUNCT__
we need your help __PUNCT__
we need you __PUNCT__
we need you to regist to vote __PUNCT__

but here the thing __PUNCT__ we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__

but the fact is that everyth i done ha been focus on how we rebuild that strong middl class __PUNCT__ how we make sure everybodi is get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi is do their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
