veteran who serv thi countri so brave __PUNCT__
soldier who ar todai defend our freedom __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ so let just get someth straight in case anybodi is confus __PUNCT__
we don't believ that anybodi is entitl to success in thi countri __PUNCT__
we don't believ govern should be help peopl who refus to help themselv __PUNCT__
but we do believ in someth call opportun __PUNCT__
we do believ that hard work should pai off __PUNCT__
we do believ in an america where everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
we do believ in an america where no matter who you ar or what you look like or what you your last name is or who you love __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that the countri i believ in __PUNCT__
that what i been fight for for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to sai thi __PUNCT__
thi countri ha gone through a veri tough time __PUNCT__ and we still got a lot of folk who ar hurt out there __PUNCT__
and i not somebodi who is come here offer some easi __PUNCT__ quick solut __PUNCT__
the truth is it go to take more than a few year to solv the challeng that were build up over decad __PUNCT__ job be ship oversea __PUNCT__ paycheck flat __PUNCT__ even as cost of everyth from colleg to health care were go up __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ in ohio __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
that too __PUNCT__
but here is what i want everybodi to be confid about __PUNCT__ our problem can be solv __PUNCT__
our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best busi in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist in the world and research __PUNCT__
we definit have the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
so especi for the young peopl out here __PUNCT__ i want you to understand __PUNCT__ there is not a countri on earth that wouldn't gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
but we got work to do __PUNCT__
we got work to do __PUNCT__
and the path i offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
and i put forward a practic __PUNCT__ five __PUNCT__ point plan to creat job and to grow the middl class and rebuild thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
so just in case you gui miss the convent and __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i know you didn't miss michel __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__
let me repris what thi plan consist of __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i want to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
when my oppon said we should just __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
that would have meant walk awai from an industri that support on in eight ohio job __PUNCT__
it support busi in __NUM__ of __NUM__ ohio counti __PUNCT__
so when he said that __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i go to bet on america __PUNCT__
i bet on american worker __PUNCT__
i bet on american industri __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back with nearli __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
and now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can give more tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that open new plant and train new worker and creat new job right here in the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i understand my oppon ha been spend some time here in ohio late __PUNCT__ and he been talk tough on china __PUNCT__
have you been hear thi __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
he been talk tough on china __PUNCT__
he sai he go to take the fight to them __PUNCT__
he go to go after these cheater __PUNCT__
and i got to admit __PUNCT__ that messag is the better __PUNCT__ is better than what he actual done about thi thing __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it sound better than talk about all the year he spent profit from compani that sent our job to china __PUNCT__
so when you hear thi newfound outrag __PUNCT__ when you see these ad he run promis to get tough on china __PUNCT__ it feel a lot like that fox sai __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we need more secur chicken coop __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ it just not credibl __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ i tell you what i done __PUNCT__ becaus i not just talk the talk __PUNCT__
i have woken up everi singl dai do everyth i can to give american worker a fair shot in thi global economi __PUNCT__
so we brought more trade case against china in on term than the previou administr did in two __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ we been win those case __PUNCT__
we stood up for autowork against unfair trade practic __PUNCT__
when governor romnei said stop an unfair surg in chines tire would be bad for america __PUNCT__ bad for our worker __PUNCT__ we polit declin hi advic __PUNCT__
we went after china on that __PUNCT__ and we got over a hundr __PUNCT__ a thousand american worker back to work produc american tire __PUNCT__
so when you want __PUNCT__ if you want to know who is go to actual fight for worker and fight for american job when it come to trade __PUNCT__ you can look at the record __PUNCT__
you can look at who said what befor elect time __PUNCT__
and right now i am ask you to choos a better path than the on that my oppon offer __PUNCT__ on that help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__ that sell more good stamp with __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ to the rest of the world __PUNCT__
we can creat on million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year with the right polici __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
that what go to be import to ohio __PUNCT__
second part of the plan __PUNCT__ i want us to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew clean energi we gener from sourc like wind and solar __PUNCT__
there ar thousand of american __PUNCT__ includ here in ohio __PUNCT__ who have job todai build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in nearli __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic between a plan that build on thi progress or a plan that revers it like my oppon suggest __PUNCT__
and thi is a clear plan __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ a clear differ __PUNCT__ becaus i will not let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
and i want to stop oil compani collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we have a better plan __PUNCT__
let take that monei we give to compani that ar alreadi huge profit __PUNCT__ everi time you go to the pump __PUNCT__ thei make monei __PUNCT__ thei don't need a tax break __PUNCT__ let us that monei and invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
let help farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and our truck __PUNCT__
let put construct worker to work retrofit home and factori so thei wast less energi __PUNCT__
let develop a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
and if we do all these thing __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import even more __PUNCT__ cut them in half by __NUM__ and support hundr of thousand of new job in the process __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
that what go to be good for ohio __PUNCT__
number three __PUNCT__ i want to give more american the chanc to get the skill that thei need to compet __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
apprenticeship __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that a good idea __PUNCT__
educ __PUNCT__ it wa my gatewai to opportun __PUNCT__
that the onli reason i stand here __PUNCT__
it wa michel path to opportun __PUNCT__
it the path more than ever to a middl class life __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ million of student ar pai less for colleg becaus we took on a system that wa wast billion of dollar us bank and lender as middlemen on the student loan process __PUNCT__
we said __PUNCT__ let give that monei directli to student __PUNCT__ and as a consequ __PUNCT__ million of student ar get more grant __PUNCT__ and we kept interest rate on student __PUNCT__ loan low __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ that what we fought for __PUNCT__
that what we fought for __PUNCT__
we alreadi got that done __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__ becaus my oppon __PUNCT__ he would gut educ to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
that on choic __PUNCT__
that door number on __PUNCT__
door number two __PUNCT__ we can decid that the unit state of america should never have a child dream defer just becaus she in a overcrowd classroom or a crumbl school or ha outdat textbook __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid an accept letter to a colleg like bowl green becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei can't find worker with the right skill here in the unit state __PUNCT__
that not the futur that we want __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ i need your help __PUNCT__ becaus i want to recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ and i want to improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more worker the chanc to learn skill that thei need at commun colleg that will directli lead to a job __PUNCT__
and i want to work with colleg presid to keep tuition cost down __PUNCT__
we can cut in half the growth of tuition if we focus on thi __PUNCT__
we can meet thi goal __PUNCT__
you can choos that futur __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__ becaus i want to make sure that the folk come behind me have the same opportun i had __PUNCT__
that what america is about __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ i want to reduc the deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i alreadi work with republican in congress to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__ and i will to do more __PUNCT__
i put forward a veri specif plan __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion in deficit reduct __PUNCT__
i want to simplifi the tax code so that it fair __PUNCT__
but i also want to ask the wealthiest household to pai a higher rate on incom over __MONEY__ the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we had the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ a whole lot of millionair did realli well too __PUNCT__
becaus that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
i want to keep tax low for middl class famili and work famili __PUNCT__
but if we go to close the deficit __PUNCT__ we got to ask folk like me to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
and understand what happen __PUNCT__
when you get a tax break __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ you spend it __PUNCT__ becaus you got __PUNCT__ time ar alreadi tough __PUNCT__
so mayb you trade in final that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car __PUNCT__ or mayb you a bui a comput for your kid who about to go off to colleg __PUNCT__
and that mean busi now ha more custom and thei make more profit __PUNCT__ which mean thei hire more worker __PUNCT__ and the whole economi doe better __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__
and that also how we reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ my oppon ha a plan __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
the problem is it miss what presid clinton call arithmet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so just understand my oppon and hi alli in congress tell us somehow we can lower the deficit by spend trillion more on new tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
no matter how mani time thei promis to __PUNCT__ reboot __PUNCT__ their campaign __PUNCT__ no matter how mani time thei start sai thei go to explain the specif of thi thing __PUNCT__ thei can't __PUNCT__ thei won't __PUNCT__
thei can't sai how thei pai for __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
thei can't explain how thei go to pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new militari spend that our militari ha said won't make us safer __PUNCT__
thei can't explain it becaus the math doesn't add up __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon mai think it fair that somebodi who make __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ like he doe __PUNCT__ pai a lower rate than a teacher or an autowork who make __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
but i disagre __PUNCT__
i don't think that fair __PUNCT__
i don't think it help grow our economi __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or look after their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
we not go to do that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we not go to do that __PUNCT__
i not go to ask the student here to pai more for colleg or kick some kid off of head start or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl just to give myself a tax cut __PUNCT__
we can't afford it __PUNCT__
and i want you gui to know __PUNCT__ i will never turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
no american should ever have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with digniti and the respect that thei earn __PUNCT__
we reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it by reduc the actual cost of care __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
and we go to keep the promis of social secur __PUNCT__
we strengthen it __PUNCT__ but we not go to turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
we not go to do that __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ governor romnei and i have a lot of differ when it come to domest polici __PUNCT__ but our prosper here at home is link to what happen abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
we did __PUNCT__
i said we respons wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
you got a new tower that rise over the new york skylin __PUNCT__ and meanwhil __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat and osama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
we made that commit __PUNCT__
but as we saw just a few dai ago __PUNCT__ we still face some seriou threat in the world __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we go to maintain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop come home and thei take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we go to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fight for america should have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
i believ that __PUNCT__
my oppon ha got a differ view __PUNCT__
he said the wai we end the war in iraq wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__
he still hasn't explain what hi polici in afghanistan will be __PUNCT__
but i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and i __PUNCT__ on more thing __PUNCT__ i will us the monei we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__
becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here in ohio __PUNCT__ right here at home __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ right here at home __PUNCT__
so thi is the choic that you face __PUNCT__ thi is what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
and over the next __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ you will be see more monei than ha ever been spent and a whole bunch of it on the other side from folk who ar write __MONEY__ million check to these super pac __PUNCT__
and thei tell you that bigger tax cut and fewer regul ar the onli wai to go __PUNCT__
their basic argument is sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their basic theori is you on your own __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ if a compani is releas toxic pollut that your kid ar breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ just borrow more monei from your parent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
we don't think govern can solv all our problem __PUNCT__ but we don't think it the sourc of all our problem __PUNCT__ either __PUNCT__
just like we don't think that folk who ar have a tough time ar our problem or welfar recipi ar our problem or corpor ar our problem or union ar our problem or immigr or gai or all the other group that we told to blame for our troubl __PUNCT__
becaus here in america __PUNCT__ we believ we in thi thing togeth __PUNCT__
we believ that all of us have respons __PUNCT__
we believ we got respons to look after ourselv and work hard and show individu initi __PUNCT__
but we also believ we have respons to each other and to thi countri and to futur gener __PUNCT__ to make sure that america continu to be the place where there more opportun and possibl than ani other nation on earth __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
we understand that america is not about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ it about what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
and that what i alwai said __PUNCT__
that why i ran for thi offic __PUNCT__ becaus i have faith in you __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i told you thi wasn't about me __PUNCT__
it wa about you __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__
you were the chang __PUNCT__
you ar the reason a mother in cleveland right now doesn't have to worri about her son be deni medic coverag becaus of some preexist condit __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you ar the reason a factori worker who lost hi job in toledo or lordstown is back on the line build some of the best car in the world __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason a student in akron or columbu or bowl green ha some help pai for a colleg educ __PUNCT__
you the reason a veteran can go to school on the new gi bill __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to the flag is not in danger of be deport from the onli countri she ever known __PUNCT__
you the reason some outstand soldier won't be kick out of our militari becaus of who thei ar or who thei love __PUNCT__
you the reason why thousand of famili have final been abl to welcom home their love on who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ to sai __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
and the interest thing is __PUNCT__ my oppon mayb doesn't understand thi concept about how chang happen __PUNCT__ becaus i made thi point down in florida __PUNCT__
i said on of the thing we learn is __PUNCT__ we can't chang washington just from the insid __PUNCT__
you got to chang it from the outsid __PUNCT__
you chang it with the help of ordinari american who ar will to make their voic heard __PUNCT__
and my oppon got realli excit __PUNCT__
he heard me sai thi __PUNCT__
he chang hi speech __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ i go to get the job done from the insid __PUNCT__
that what he said __PUNCT__ i go to get the job done from the insid __PUNCT__
and i think to myself __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what kind of insid job is he talk about __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ is he talk about the insid job to rubberstamp the agenda of thi republican congress __PUNCT__ becaus if he is __PUNCT__ we don't want it __PUNCT__
if he talk about the insid job of let oil compani write the energi polici and insur compani write health care polici and outsourc rewrit our tax code __PUNCT__ we don't need that __PUNCT__
if he talk about the insid job where politician in washington ar control the health care choic that women ar perfectli capabl of make for themselv __PUNCT__ we take a pass __PUNCT__
we don't need an insid job __PUNCT__
we want to chang washington __PUNCT__
i alwai said chang is hard __PUNCT__ it take more than on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
and the wai our democraci work __PUNCT__ we never go to get everyth that each of us individu want __PUNCT__
but if we work togeth __PUNCT__ you can make thing happen __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you can't make it happen if you write off half the nation befor you take offic __PUNCT__
it interest __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ percent of the countri did not vote for me __PUNCT__
thei vote for john mccain __PUNCT__
but on elect night __PUNCT__ in grant park in chicago __PUNCT__ i said to all those american who didn't vote for me __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ i mai not have won your vote __PUNCT__ but i hear your voic __PUNCT__ and i need your help __PUNCT__
and i will be your presid too __PUNCT__
that what i said __PUNCT__
so i don't know how mani vote i get in ohio thi time __PUNCT__ but no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what parti you belong to __PUNCT__ and i want everybodi who listen on televis to understand __PUNCT__ i will be fight for you __PUNCT__
becaus i not fight to creat democrat job or republican job __PUNCT__ i fight to creat american job __PUNCT__
i not fight to improv blue __PUNCT__ state school or red __PUNCT__ state school __PUNCT__ i fight to improv school in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
the valu of hard work and person respons __PUNCT__ those valu that we believ in don't just belong to worker or busi or the rich or the poor __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ percent or the __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ percent or the __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
those ar american valu __PUNCT__
thei belong to all of us __PUNCT__
