audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ let me move on to anoth topic then __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it is so great to be here __PUNCT__
we just had our convent in charlott __PUNCT__ north carolina __PUNCT__
folk there could not have been more welcom __PUNCT__
michel wa michel __PUNCT__
she wa amaz __PUNCT__
so for the young men out there who ar think about their futur __PUNCT__ the goal is to marri up and improv your gene pool __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and that what i have done by marri michel __PUNCT__
then you have presid clinton who made the case the onli wai that he can __PUNCT__
somebodi sent out a tweet after he spoke __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ somebodi need to make him secretari of explain stuff __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ which i like __PUNCT__
i like that __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ on thursdai night __PUNCT__ i spoke about the stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you now heard both side make their argument __PUNCT__ and i hope you know at thi point __PUNCT__ there a big choic to make __PUNCT__
and it is the clearest choic of ani time in a gener __PUNCT__
it is not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__ it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
it is a choic between two fundament differ path for america __PUNCT__ two veri differ vision for our futur __PUNCT__
and our fight is for that basic bargain that built the middl class in thi countri and the strongest economi the world ever known __PUNCT__
and it wa basic a simpl idea __PUNCT__ the idea that here in america hard work will pai off __PUNCT__
that here in america __PUNCT__ respons will be reward __PUNCT__ that everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from wall street to main street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
and that basic bargain is why i ran for presid __PUNCT__ becaus i saw too mani job disappear oversea __PUNCT__ too mani famili struggl with the cost that keep on go up even though paycheck aren't go up __PUNCT__ too mani peopl rack up more and more debt just to make the mortgag or pai tuition or put ga in the car or food on the tabl __PUNCT__
and when thi hous of card collaps in thi great recess __PUNCT__ we saw million of innoc american lose their job __PUNCT__ lose their home __PUNCT__ lose their save __PUNCT__
and we still try to recov from that tragedi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ our friend at the republican convent __PUNCT__ thei were more than happi to talk about everyth that thei think is wrong with america __PUNCT__ but thei didn't have much to sai about how to make it right __PUNCT__
thei want your vote __PUNCT__ but thei don't have a plan __PUNCT__
or at least __PUNCT__ thei don't want to tell you their plan __PUNCT__
and that becaus thei got the same plan thei had for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ gut a few regul __PUNCT__ and then give some more tax cut __PUNCT__
tax cut when time ar good __PUNCT__
tax cut when time ar bad __PUNCT__
tax cut to help you lose a few extra pound __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ tax cut to improv your love life __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i said that at the last event yesterdai __PUNCT__ and somebodi yell out __PUNCT__ i tri it __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ i given tax cut to folk who need it __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis i would cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
and you did __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and i did __PUNCT__
the typic famili is pai __MONEY__ less in feder tax sinc i been presid __PUNCT__
we cut tax for small busi __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
but i don't believ that anoth round of tax break for millionair ar go to bring good job to our shore or pai down the deficit __PUNCT__ just like i don't think that fire teacher or kick student off of financi aid is go to help grown an economi __PUNCT__
that not go to help us compet with china and other countri that ar come up __PUNCT__
after all we been through __PUNCT__ i sure don't believ roll back regul we put in place to make sure wall street doesn't act recklessli __PUNCT__ that roll those regul back somehow will help small __PUNCT__ busi women here in florida or laid off construct worker get back to work __PUNCT__
let me tell you __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ what thei ar sell we ar not bui __PUNCT__
we been there __PUNCT__ we tri it __PUNCT__
it not work __PUNCT__
we not go back __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i will not pretend that the path i offer is quick or easi __PUNCT__
it go to take more than a few year to deal with problem that have been build up for decad __PUNCT__
but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ when our oppon goe around sai that the nation is in declin __PUNCT__ he doesn't know what he talk about __PUNCT__
thi is america __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__ the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
we ar a young nation __PUNCT__
we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__
peopl want to come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay tell us __PUNCT__ no matter what thei __PUNCT__ how dark thei try to make thing look for elect time __PUNCT__ there not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state __PUNCT__
so i promis you our problem can be solv and our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
the path we offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it will lead to a better place __PUNCT__
and i ask you to choos that futur __PUNCT__
i ask you to ralli around some goal __PUNCT__ concret __PUNCT__ achiev goal in manufactur and energi __PUNCT__ and educ __PUNCT__ in reduc our deficit that will lead to new job and more opportun __PUNCT__ and it will rebuild our economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
that what the next __NUM__ year ar about __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
that why i need your support __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that why i need your support __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ just in case some of you miss me on thursdai __PUNCT__ i want to be __PUNCT__ i want to lai out onc again what i talk about with thi plan __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i got a plan to export more product and send fewer job oversea __PUNCT__
after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ thi countri ha actual creat more than half a million new manufactur job over the last 2Â½ year __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
here on the space coast __PUNCT__ we start a new era of american explor that is creat good job right here in thi counti __PUNCT__
we begun an ambiti new direct for nasa by lai the groundwork for __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri space flight and innov __PUNCT__
and just last month __PUNCT__ we wit an incred achiev that speak to the nation sens of wonder and our can __PUNCT__ do spirit __PUNCT__ the unit state of america land curios on mar __PUNCT__
so thi is an exampl of what we do when we combin our scienc __PUNCT__ our research __PUNCT__ our abil to commerci new product __PUNCT__ make them here in america __PUNCT__
so thi is where we got a choic __PUNCT__
we could __PUNCT__ as the hous republican budget propos __PUNCT__ cut back on research and technolog __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can continu to be at the cut edg __PUNCT__ becaus that what we alwai been about __PUNCT__
we can spark new discoveri __PUNCT__ launch new career __PUNCT__ inspir the next gener to reach for someth better __PUNCT__
you got that choic __PUNCT__
we can make sure that not onli ar we invest in great research __PUNCT__ but the product that come out of that research ar made here in the unit state __PUNCT__
we can chang our tax code so we stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let reward them for invest in new plant and equip here in the u. __PUNCT__ and train new worker here in the u. __PUNCT__ and keep the research and develop here in the u. __PUNCT__ and creat job right here in the u. __PUNCT__ make product that we sell around the world stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in the u.s.a __PUNCT__ that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that the futur we want __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__
we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
and that creat job __PUNCT__
and we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ here in florida __PUNCT__ you ar a gatewai for thi huge latin american market that grow __PUNCT__
which is why __PUNCT__ dure the recoveri act __PUNCT__ we help local commun revamp their port and their road so that we can move more product onto those contain ship that ar send good down to brazil and mexico and other part __PUNCT__ argentina __PUNCT__ and all across our hemispher __PUNCT__
and that also why __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ we attract more tourist from thi region __PUNCT__
we made it easier for folk to come visit florida __PUNCT__ becaus that creat job right here in florida __PUNCT__
so thi is all part of the notion that we don't want to just borrow and spend __PUNCT__ we also want to make stuff and sell __PUNCT__
that part on of the plan __PUNCT__
part two __PUNCT__ i got a plan to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car or truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__ and it will help the environ __PUNCT__
we doubl our us of renew energi __PUNCT__
thousand of american have job todai build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri and solar panel that ar be us right here in florida to gener energi __PUNCT__
i want you gui to know thi __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic between a plan that revers thi progress or on that build on it __PUNCT__
unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan or endang our coastlin or collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__ where we keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog and farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and our truck and where we put construct worker back to work build factori that wast less energi __PUNCT__ retrofit school and hospit and build so that thei us less energi __PUNCT__ where we develop a hundr year __PUNCT__ suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
and if we choos thi path __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and that alon will support __NUM__ new job in natur ga __PUNCT__
we can move forward __PUNCT__ but we can't go backward __PUNCT__
that what the next __NUM__ year ar about __PUNCT__
part three __PUNCT__ part three __PUNCT__ i got a plan to give more american the chanc to gain the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa the kei to opportun for me __PUNCT__ for michel __PUNCT__ for mani of you __PUNCT__
and so we focus on thi the minut i came into offic __PUNCT__
and for the first time in a gener __PUNCT__ nearli everi state ha answer our call to rais their standard for teach and learn __PUNCT__
and some of the worst school in the countri have made real progress and real gain in math and read __PUNCT__
million of student __PUNCT__ includ some student at thi institut __PUNCT__ ar pai less todai for colleg becaus we took on a system that wa wast billion of taxpay dollar send it to bank __PUNCT__ we said let send it directli to student __PUNCT__
and student ar pai less for their colleg educ becaus of it __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you our choic __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that a good choic __PUNCT__
we can gut our invest in educ __PUNCT__ as the budget be propos by the other side would do __PUNCT__
or we can decid in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have their dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom or outdat textbook __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid an accept letter for colleg becaus thei realiz __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ honei __PUNCT__ we just can't afford it __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in some other countri becaus thei couldn't find the worker with the right skill right here in the unit state __PUNCT__
so we got to focu on thi __PUNCT__
help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher and improv earli childhood educ and give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn skill at their local commun colleg that will lead directli to a job __PUNCT__
and help me work with colleg and univers to cut in half the growth of tuition cost over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can meet that goal togeth __PUNCT__
we can help the next gener __PUNCT__
we can choos that futur for america __PUNCT__
but i can onli do it with you __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ let make sure that we reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ independ analysi sai that my plan for reduc our deficit would lower them by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ that with a __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
and i work with republican in congress alreadi to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__ and i will to do more __PUNCT__
i want to work with them __PUNCT__
i want a tax code that fair and simpler __PUNCT__
but i also want to ask folk like me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ the wealthiest household in america __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ to just pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ higher tax on incom over the first __MONEY__ of their incom to help reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
that the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ and we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest surplu in histori and a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i just want to be clear __PUNCT__ under my plan __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of folk who make less than __NUM__ you wouldn't see your incom tax go up a singl dime __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ becaus you the on who need relief __PUNCT__
and what happen when you got a littl more monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you spend it __PUNCT__
mayb you bui a new comput for your son or daughter __PUNCT__
mayb you bui a new car after __NUM__ year of drive that old beater around __PUNCT__
and what happen __PUNCT__ when you spend __PUNCT__ then busi have more custom __PUNCT__ and then thei make more profit __PUNCT__ and then thei hire more worker __PUNCT__ who then __PUNCT__ in turn __PUNCT__ go bui more product __PUNCT__
that how we grow an economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
but what we heard in tampa __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei didn't realli sai much about it __PUNCT__ but what you see on their web site __PUNCT__ what you seen republican in congress vote on __PUNCT__ is a differ kind of plan __PUNCT__
presid clinton point out that the singl biggest thing miss from my oppon plan is arithmet __PUNCT__
math __PUNCT__
governor romnei and hi alli tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spend trillion of more dollar on new tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ you got to do the math __PUNCT__ becaus when my oppon were ask about it todai __PUNCT__ thei couldn't __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it wa like two plu on equal five __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei couldn't answer question about how thei pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut and __MONEY__ trillion in new defens spend without rais tax on the middl class __PUNCT__
that not bold leadership __PUNCT__ that bad math __PUNCT__
that get a fail grade __PUNCT__
i refus to go along with that plan __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth tax cut for somebodi like me or mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg __PUNCT__ or kick children out of head start program just to give millionair a tax break __PUNCT__
i not go to elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__ all so those with the most can pai less __PUNCT__
and i want you to know __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ i will never turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i had a wonder breakfast with two retir coupl over at cocoa __PUNCT__ jerri and __DATE__ and john and shirlei __PUNCT__ thei here somewher __PUNCT__
there thei ar __PUNCT__ thei over there __PUNCT__
and that wa a good breakfast __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ wasn't it __PUNCT__ it wa outstand __PUNCT__
and thei were wise enough to move to florida after thei retir becaus thei were live in veri cold weather __PUNCT__
and thei love it here __PUNCT__
but we were talk about how __PUNCT__ after a lifetim of work __PUNCT__ thei been abl to save enough to have a comfort retir __PUNCT__ but that onli becaus medicar is there rock solid for them __PUNCT__ onli becaus we have made that commit that sai if you work hard all your life __PUNCT__ then you should have some basic secur __PUNCT__ not to live lavishli __PUNCT__ but to know that it go to be there for you __PUNCT__
and i have to tell you __PUNCT__ that is go to be part of what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i alreadi strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
we alreadi ad year to the life of medicar by get rid of taxpay subsidi to insur compani that weren't make peopl ani healthier and __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ were make thing more expens for everybodi __PUNCT__
so we us part of those save to help lower the cost of prescript drug and offer free prevent care to senior __PUNCT__
i thought that wa a good idea __PUNCT__
for some reason __PUNCT__ my oppon think it a bad idea __PUNCT__
so thei want to give the monei back to the insur compani and then put them in charg of medicar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ on report just said that by the end of the next decad __PUNCT__ our oppon __PUNCT__ plan would mean as much as __MONEY__ billion to __MONEY__ billion in new profit for insur compani __PUNCT__
so basic __PUNCT__ your cost would rise by the thousand so that their profit could rise by the billion __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so here the bottom line __PUNCT__
their voucher plan for medicar would bankrupt medicar __PUNCT__
our plan strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
no american should have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with the digniti and the respect and the care that thei have earn __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we will reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
we not go to do that __PUNCT__
and while we at it __PUNCT__ we go to keep the promis of social secur by take respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ not by turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ if you wonder who is right on thi argument about medicar __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you ar __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ but in case some of your friend ar wonder __PUNCT__ let put it that wai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ keep in mind that the aarp __PUNCT__ which know a littl bit about thi __PUNCT__ thei took a look at our plan when we pass obamacar __PUNCT__ and thei confirm that it strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
and when you look at their plan __PUNCT__ it confirm that over time a voucher system will weaken medicar as we know it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
that why we need a new governor __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i talk about the feder elect right now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ rebuild thi economi is essenti __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ as mari said __PUNCT__ our prosper at home is also link to our secur and our polici abroad __PUNCT__
so i just want to remind everybodi __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
we said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar do that __PUNCT__
and a few dai befor 9/11 __PUNCT__ a new tower is rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__
we come back __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ and usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
so i just want you to rememb when my oppon and hi vice presidenti nomine ar run around sai somehow we weaken our militari __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
when our troop take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei have serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home after serv on behalf of the unit state __PUNCT__
but we got some disagr __PUNCT__
my oppon sai it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ for me to end the iraq war the wai i did __PUNCT__
i think he wrong __PUNCT__
he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__
my oppon want to spend more monei on militari program that our joint chief don't even want __PUNCT__
i us that monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and school and bridg __PUNCT__
after a decad of war __PUNCT__ we need to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that what we go to do __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ that the choic that we now face __PUNCT__
that the choic that you face __PUNCT__
over and over we have been told by our oppon that the onli answer __PUNCT__ the onli wai ar bigger tax cut and fewer regul __PUNCT__ shrink govern __PUNCT__ becaus their basic idea is that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if there some toxic pollut that go into the air that our kid breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow some monei from your parent __PUNCT__
