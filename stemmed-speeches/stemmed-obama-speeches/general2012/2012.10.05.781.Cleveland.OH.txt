everybodi is get a fair shot __PUNCT__
everybodi is do their fair share __PUNCT__
everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ not just rule benefit a few __PUNCT__
but in order for us to make thi happen __PUNCT__ you gui ar go to have to vote __PUNCT__
and you go to have to ralli around the plan that i present __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ make sure we got the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
tatiana is an exampl of the incred potenti that our young peopl have __PUNCT__ but we got to make that real for them __PUNCT__

rememb __PUNCT__ when we save that auto industri __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i put my bet on american worker and american industri __PUNCT__
and so now we got to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea and give them to compani that ar hire right here in ohio __PUNCT__ hire right here in cleveland __PUNCT__
that what we need __PUNCT__
we need to develop our energi sourc __PUNCT__
but in addit to oil and ga and clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ which we __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ have made the largest invest ever in clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
but we also need to develop wind and solar __PUNCT__ becaus there ar job in ohio right now __PUNCT__ folk make wind turbin and make long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
we got to continu to do that __PUNCT__
we got to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but we got to do in a sensibl wai __PUNCT__
i am not go to kick kid off of head start __PUNCT__
i not go to make colleg more expens for the student here at cleveland state just to give anoth tax break to folk who don't need it and weren't even ask for it __PUNCT__

i said i go to wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and i have __PUNCT__
mitt romnei ha differ idea __PUNCT__
he like to talk tough __PUNCT__
but what i know is __PUNCT__ is that thank to the incred servic of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the run and usama bin laden is no more __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ as command in chief __PUNCT__ i will maintain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but i also go to make sure when our troop come home and thei take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we serv them as well as thei have serv us __PUNCT__
thei shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home after thei fought for us all these year __PUNCT__
so look __PUNCT__ here the bottom line __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
we got more work to do __PUNCT__ but the onli wai we go to do it is with you __PUNCT__
you the reason we pass health care reform so that children out there ar all abl to get insur even if thei got a preexist condit __PUNCT__
you the reason that we been abl to help young peopl attend colleg by try to give them more pell grant and more financi aid __PUNCT__
you the reason that famili all across ohio have been abl to get a littl bit of a tax break __PUNCT__ a littl extra monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ which then mean busi have more custom __PUNCT__ which mean busi then hire more worker __PUNCT__ which mean the economi begin to heal from the mess that we inherit __PUNCT__
you made these thing happen __PUNCT__
you were the on who help us end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
you the on who ar help to make sure that we doubl fuel effici standard on car __PUNCT__

but if that progress is go to continu __PUNCT__ you got to step up __PUNCT__
and i know i preach to the choir here becaus you all ar stand in the rain __PUNCT__
but a littl rain never hurt anybodi __PUNCT__
some of these polici from the other side could hurt a whole lot of folk __PUNCT__
so we onli got just a littl over a month left __PUNCT__ and you can start vote right now __PUNCT__
and the wai we go to do it is remind ourselv that the onli wai thi countri make progress is when we do it togeth __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ young __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ rich __PUNCT__ poor __PUNCT__ abl __PUNCT__ and disabl __PUNCT__
