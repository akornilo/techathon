and i know that sometim modern campaign aren't pretti to watch __PUNCT__ becaus basic __PUNCT__ so much of it involv million of dollar on televis __PUNCT__
most of the ad ar neg __PUNCT__ and at a certain point __PUNCT__ peopl get discourag and start feel like nobodi in washington listen to what go on to ordinari folk all across the countri __PUNCT__
but i got to tell you __PUNCT__ despit the cynic and the negativ __PUNCT__ what i __PUNCT__ what i think about is my first race __PUNCT__
and what __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what i think about is my first race __PUNCT__
and thi is when i wa first run for state senat __PUNCT__ i couldn't afford televis commerci __PUNCT__
and michel and i __PUNCT__ we us to go door to door and pass out flyer that we had print out in kinko __PUNCT__
and we had our friend and our famili member __PUNCT__ and we march in fourth of __DATE__ parad __PUNCT__
and it wa hard work __PUNCT__
and i didn't have air forc on back then __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but when i think about my first race __PUNCT__ i think about why i got into polit __PUNCT__
and the reason i got into polit wa becaus thi countri ha bless me so much __PUNCT__
and i thought about my own famili __PUNCT__ how my grandfath fought in patton armi in world war ii while my grandmoth wa back home work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when my grandfath came back __PUNCT__ he wa abl to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to bui a home through the fha __PUNCT__
and then i thought about my singl mom __PUNCT__ becaus my dad left when i wa veri young __PUNCT__ and how __PUNCT__ despit all the struggl __PUNCT__ she wa abl to get a great educ becaus that the kind of countri thi wa __PUNCT__
and she wa abl to pass on a great educ to me and my sister __PUNCT__
and then i think about michel mom __PUNCT__ and the fact that michel mom and dad __PUNCT__ thei didn't come from a wealthi famili __PUNCT__
michel dad __PUNCT__ he work a blue __PUNCT__ collar job at the sanitari plant in chicago __PUNCT__
and my mother __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ she stai at home until the kid got older __PUNCT__
and she end up becom a secretari __PUNCT__ and that what she work at most of her life __PUNCT__ wa a secretari at a bank __PUNCT__
so none of us came from privileg background __PUNCT__ none of us had a lot of wealth or fame __PUNCT__
but what we understood wa that here in america __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what church you worship at __PUNCT__ no matter what region of the countri __PUNCT__ if you were will to work hard __PUNCT__ if you were will to take respons for your life __PUNCT__ you could make it if you try here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and that basic idea __PUNCT__ that basic bargain that sai here we all deserv a fair shot and everybodi should do their fair share and everybodi should plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ that basic bargain that sai if you will to work hard and take respons in your own life __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that pai a live wage and you can save up and bui a home and you won't go bankrupt if you get sick __PUNCT__
mayb you can take a vacat with your famili onc in a while __PUNCT__
noth fanci __PUNCT__ but you can go out and go visit some of our nation park or __PUNCT__ i rememb my favorit vacat when i wa a kid __PUNCT__ travel with my mom and my grandma and my sister __PUNCT__ and we travel the countri on greyhound buse and railroad __PUNCT__
and onc in a while __PUNCT__ we rent a car __PUNCT__ not that often __PUNCT__ and stai at howard johnson and __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ didn't matter how big the pool wa __PUNCT__ if there wa a pool __PUNCT__ i jump in __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i wa __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ and i wa excit just to go to the vend machin and get the ic bucket and get the ic __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ the chanc to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ that dream of a strong middl class __PUNCT__ that what america ha alwai been about __PUNCT__
that what led me to get into public servic __PUNCT__
that what led to my first campaign __PUNCT__ wa make sure that access to that middl class __PUNCT__ that grow __PUNCT__ thrive heartbeat of america __PUNCT__ that that wa avail for everybodi __PUNCT__ that it wasn't just avail for me and michel __PUNCT__ but it wa avail for everi kid all across thi countri __PUNCT__
and that what led me to run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and that what led me to ask you for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ to fight for america middl class and everybodi who is try to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that idea ha been get batter a littl bit over the last decad __PUNCT__
part of the reason i ran in __NUM__ part of the reason so mani of you came togeth to work on that campaign __PUNCT__ wa we had seen a decad in which those middl class dream were under assault __PUNCT__
folk were work harder __PUNCT__ but make less __PUNCT__
cost of everyth from health care to colleg to groceri to ga kept on go up __PUNCT__ but your salari or your wage didn't __PUNCT__
we had put two war on a credit card __PUNCT__ taken a surplu and turn it into a deficit __PUNCT__ and all of it culmin in the worst financi crisi that we seen in our lifetim __PUNCT__
so what we came togeth to do in __NUM__ wa start thi process __PUNCT__ thi painstak __PUNCT__ labori process __PUNCT__ to turn thi countri back toward those core valu __PUNCT__ to turn thi countri back toward our best selv and our best ideal __PUNCT__
and we knew we wouldn't be abl to do it overnight becaus these problem weren't creat overnight __PUNCT__
but we believ in thi countri __PUNCT__ and we believ in the american peopl __PUNCT__
we understood that thi ha never been a countri of folk look for handout __PUNCT__ but what thei do want is a fight chanc __PUNCT__
and so for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ when some folk said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ we bet on the american worker __PUNCT__
we bet on the american industri __PUNCT__
and now gm is back at number on __PUNCT__ and chrysler and ford ar back __PUNCT__
and we start to see manufactur come back to our shore __PUNCT__ more manufactur job creat than ani time sinc the 1990 __PUNCT__
we saw peopl go back and get retrain for job __PUNCT__ sometim get job of the futur __PUNCT__ advanc manufactur __PUNCT__ new technolog __PUNCT__ and clean energi __PUNCT__
we seen small busi who almost had to shutter their door dure the crisi __PUNCT__ but sometim the owner didn't take a salari becaus thei want to keep their folk work __PUNCT__
and somehow __PUNCT__ inch by inch __PUNCT__ yard by yard __PUNCT__ mile by mile __PUNCT__ thei been abl to come all the wai back and ar now start to hire worker again __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ million job creat over the last 2Â½ year __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ manufactur job __PUNCT__
so we been fight back __PUNCT__ but what we all understand is that we got so much more to do __PUNCT__
too mani of our friend and famili member and neighbor ar still out of work __PUNCT__ too mani folk still ar see their home properti valu underwat __PUNCT__
and so the question for all of you at thi moment is __PUNCT__ how will we determin our direct __PUNCT__ not just for the next year __PUNCT__ not just for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but for the next decad __PUNCT__ the next two decad __PUNCT__ becaus thi elect is not just about two candid or two parti __PUNCT__ it about two fundament differ vision of where we take america __PUNCT__
and the stake could not be higher __PUNCT__
and ultim __PUNCT__ the wai we go to make thi decis is you __PUNCT__
there a stalem in washington right now becaus there ar two differ vision of how we have to move forward __PUNCT__ and you got to break that stalem __PUNCT__
so let me just veri briefli tell you what the choic ar __PUNCT__
you got mr __PUNCT__ romnei and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and their basic vision is on that sai we go to give __MONEY__ trillion of new tax cut on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ most of them go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
thei won't be paid for __PUNCT__ or if thei ar paid for __PUNCT__ thei be paid for by slash educ fund __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ or make colleg loan more expens __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ or elimin support for basic scienc and research __PUNCT__ the kind of work that done right here at carnegi mellon __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ or make medicar a voucher system __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that on part of their plan __PUNCT__
and the second part of their plan is __PUNCT__ let elimin regul __PUNCT__ regul that we just put in place to make sure that wall street doesn't act recklessli and we can prevent anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout when the financi system goe out of whack __PUNCT__ regul that protect our air or our water __PUNCT__ regul that protect consum from be taken advantag of __PUNCT__
and that it __PUNCT__
that their econom plan __PUNCT__
don't take my word for it __PUNCT__ go on their web site __PUNCT__
the republican in congress vote for thi plan __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ it is a theori __PUNCT__
it an idea of how you might grow an economi __PUNCT__ if we hadn't just tri it for __NUM__ year befor i took offic __PUNCT__
we tri it __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
so why would we want to go backward to the same theori that didn't work befor __PUNCT__ thei bank on the notion that you don't rememb what happen when thei were in charg __PUNCT__ the last time thei were in charg of the white hous __PUNCT__ and how surplus becam deficit and how job growth wa more sluggish than it been in __NUM__ year and how we ultim end up with the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ pittsburgh __PUNCT__ i want you to know i got a differ theori __PUNCT__
i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
and let me be honest __PUNCT__ it not a silver bullet __PUNCT__
it not go to chang thing complet in the next dai or the next week __PUNCT__
but it move us in a direct that is true to our tradit by build not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl class out __PUNCT__
it a vision that sai we don't need to just bring automak back __PUNCT__ we can bring manufactur back to america __PUNCT__
we can invest in advanc manufactur research like is be done right here at carnegi mellon __PUNCT__
and we can chang our tax code to make sure __PUNCT__ instead of give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ let give those tax break to compani that ar invest right here in pittsburgh __PUNCT__ right here in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that my vision for the futur __PUNCT__
my vision is on that sai we got to invest in our young peopl so thei get the best educ in the world __PUNCT__
so i want to hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to keep on make colleg more afford __PUNCT__
we just prevent congress from doubl student interest loan rate becaus of you __PUNCT__
but we got to do more to bring tuition down and give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to studi at commun colleg and get the job train thei need for the job of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
becaus a higher educ is not an econom luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess __PUNCT__
and i commit to make sure everybodi get that chanc for the skill and the train thei need to succe __PUNCT__
my vision sai we end the war in iraq as i promis __PUNCT__ and we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
so let take half of that monei that we save in war and us it to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__
let take the other half and do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let put some american back to work rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ our school __PUNCT__
let build broadband line and wireless network and high __PUNCT__ speed rail __PUNCT__
let invest in the basic scienc and research that help to send a man to the moon and creat the internet __PUNCT__
that what make america great __PUNCT__
we ar innov and risk taker __PUNCT__
i believ in an america in which we control our own energi futur __PUNCT__
we produc more oil than we have in the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we import less __PUNCT__
but we can do so much more __PUNCT__
we got to bet on not just an oil industri that alreadi profit __PUNCT__
we got to bet on a clean energi industri of solar and wind that can creat job and help our environ and free ourselv from depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
and i got a vision that believ that everybodi __PUNCT__ all famili who ar respons __PUNCT__ should be abl to have the basic secur of health care __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__ the law we pass is here to stai __PUNCT__
if you have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that chang for you is you more secur becaus insur compani can't drop you when you get sick __PUNCT__
thei don't have a lifetim limit where suddenli thei dump the cost on you __PUNCT__ even though you been pai your premium __PUNCT__
we got million of young peopl who ar abl to stai on their parent plan right now becaus of that health care law __PUNCT__
we got million of senior who ar see cheaper prescript drug __PUNCT__
and if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ we go to help you get health insur __PUNCT__
i believ it wa the right thing to do becaus that part of make sure a middl class is thrive in thi countri __PUNCT__ that thei don't have to fear that when somebodi in their famili get sick __PUNCT__ that somehow thei go to lose everyth thei work for all those year __PUNCT__
i make no apolog for it __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and we go to keep move forward __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we not go to go back to a vision that somehow think when a few wealthi investor do well __PUNCT__ then everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
so you know what __PUNCT__ we need to deal with our deficit __PUNCT__
we need to deal with our debt __PUNCT__
and part of america charact is the understand that govern can't solv everi problem __PUNCT__
we don't expect it to __PUNCT__
some folk can't be help if thei don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
not everi govern program work __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar in spend that wasn't help famili succe __PUNCT__ and we do some more __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ we ar not just go to cut and balanc the budget on the back of middl class famili __PUNCT__ ask them to pai more tax __PUNCT__ ask them to suddenli not get help when it come to send their kid to colleg __PUNCT__
i think we can ask wealthiest american to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
we need to have a tax code where secretari aren't pai a lower tax rate than their boss __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ the good new is there ar a lot of american all across the countri __PUNCT__ veri success american __PUNCT__ who agre with me on thi __PUNCT__ becaus thei understand the onli reason thei succeed wa somebodi help them __PUNCT__
didn't give them a handout __PUNCT__ but gave them a hand up __PUNCT__
thi idea that we all in it togeth __PUNCT__ that we rise or fall as on peopl __PUNCT__ that theori of mine about how to grow the economi __PUNCT__ we tri that too __PUNCT__
we tri it as recent as when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and we had a surplu at the end of it instead of a deficit __PUNCT__
and we creat a whole lot of wealth and a lot of millionair along the wai __PUNCT__
becaus that formula that sai we in it togeth mean that everybodi can do well __PUNCT__
the reason we built the hoover dam or the golden gate bridg __PUNCT__ the reason we sent a man to the moon or invest in the research that result in the internet __PUNCT__ the reason we built an interst highwai system __PUNCT__ we did those thing not for ani individu to becom rich __PUNCT__ we did it so that all of us would have a platform for success __PUNCT__ becaus we understand there ar some thing we do better togeth __PUNCT__
i continu to believ that __PUNCT__
i think most american understand that __PUNCT__
that the reason i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you go to see more monei spent than you ever seen befor __PUNCT__ more neg ad __PUNCT__
these gui ar write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and you hear the same thing from them over and over again __PUNCT__ becaus thei know that their econom theori isn't go to sell __PUNCT__ so all thei got to argu is __PUNCT__ the economi is not move as fast as it need to __PUNCT__ job aren't grow as fast as thei need to __PUNCT__ and it all obama fault __PUNCT__
that basic their onli messag __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i guess thi is a plan to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to grow our middl class __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ i might be worri about all thi monei be spent if it wasn't for my memori of previou campaign __PUNCT__
that first campaign i ran __PUNCT__ the last campaign i ran in __NUM__ i been outspent befor __PUNCT__
i had a lot of monei thrown at me befor __PUNCT__
but you know what i learn __PUNCT__ is that when the american peopl decid on what right __PUNCT__ when all of you decid on what true __PUNCT__ when you rememb the stori of your famili just like the stori of my famili __PUNCT__ all the struggl our parent and our grandpar and great __PUNCT__ grandpar went through __PUNCT__ some of them mayb came over here as immigr and start work in the mine or work in the mill __PUNCT__ not alwai know what to expect __PUNCT__ but understand that there wa someth differ about thi countri __PUNCT__ look out for on anoth __PUNCT__ take care of the commun togeth __PUNCT__ be respons __PUNCT__ have those old __PUNCT__ fashion __PUNCT__ homespun valu __PUNCT__ believ that be middl class wasn't a matter of your bank account __PUNCT__ it wa a state of mind in term of what you believ __PUNCT__ that there were some thing that were import and noth wa more import than look after your famili and be with your famili and care for your famili __PUNCT__ when american come togeth and tap into that spirit that is best in us __PUNCT__ all that monei doesn't matter __PUNCT__
all those neg ad don't matter __PUNCT__
you make chang happen __PUNCT__
you inspir each other __PUNCT__
you inspir me __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i told you i not a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but i told you i alwai tell you what i thought and i alwai tell you where i stood __PUNCT__
and i told you i would wake up everi singl dai fight as hard as i knew how for you __PUNCT__ to make your live a littl bit better __PUNCT__ to give you more of a fight shot to succe and live out your dream __PUNCT__
and i made that promis becaus i saw myself in you __PUNCT__
in your grandpar __PUNCT__ i see my grandpar __PUNCT__
in your children __PUNCT__ i see malia and sasha __PUNCT__
and i kept that promis __PUNCT__
i kept that promis __PUNCT__
everi morn and everi night __PUNCT__ i thought about how we build america and how we build america middl class and how we give everybodi a fair shot and how we make sure everybodi do their fair share and how we make sure everybodi fight by the same rule __PUNCT__
and if you still believ in me like i believ in you __PUNCT__ i hope you will stand with me in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
becaus if you do __PUNCT__ we will finish what we start in __NUM__ and thi economi will be move again __PUNCT__
and we remind the world just why it is that the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
