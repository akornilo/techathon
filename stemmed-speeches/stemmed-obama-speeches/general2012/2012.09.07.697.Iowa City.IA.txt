i honestli believ thi is the clearest choic that we had in my lifetim __PUNCT__ becaus it not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__ it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
it a choic between two fundament differ vision of our futur __PUNCT__ where america goe __PUNCT__
our is a fight to build that basic bargain again that creat the greatest __PUNCT__ largest middl class and the strongest economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__ the basic bargain that sai if you work hard it will pai off __PUNCT__ that respons will be reward __PUNCT__ that everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ from main street to wall street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
and restor that basic bargain is why i got into public servic in the first place __PUNCT__
i start my career work in the shadow of steel mill where folk had been laid off as job were be shift oversea __PUNCT__
and for the last decad __PUNCT__ we seen too mani famili here in iowa and all across the countri struggl with cost that keep rise even when paycheck don't __PUNCT__ peopl rack up more debt __PUNCT__ us credit card __PUNCT__ home equiti loan just to make the mortgag or pai tuition or put ga in the car or put food on the tabl __PUNCT__
and all that collaps in the great recess __PUNCT__ where million of innoc american lost their job and their home and their life save __PUNCT__
and we have been fight to recov ever sinc from that devast __PUNCT__

when i wa campaign in iowa back in __NUM__ i said we go to cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__ and that what we done __PUNCT__
the averag famili ha seen their tax burden go down __MONEY__ sinc i becom presid __PUNCT__
i kept that promis __PUNCT__
but i don't know about you __PUNCT__ i don't believ that anoth round of tax break for millionair will bring good job back to our shore or pai down our deficit __PUNCT__
i sure don't think fire teacher or kick student off of financi aid is somehow go to grow our economi or help us compet with scientist and engin that ar come out of china __PUNCT__
i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but after all we been through __PUNCT__ after the crisi we went through in __NUM__ i don't think that roll back regul on wall street ar somehow go to help the small __PUNCT__ businesswoman in iowa citi expand or the laid __PUNCT__ off construct worker in de moin keep hi home __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__
we have tri that __PUNCT__
we ar not go back __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i won't pretend __PUNCT__ i told you last night __PUNCT__ i will not pretend that the path i offer is quick or easi __PUNCT__
anybodi who sai it is __PUNCT__ thei not tell you the truth __PUNCT__
i never said it wa go to be quick and easi __PUNCT__
what i said wa __PUNCT__ we can move forward __PUNCT__
we can make progress __PUNCT__
we can make thing better __PUNCT__
we can strengthen our middl class __PUNCT__
we can rebuild a strong foundat for our economi __PUNCT__
as bill clinton remind us on wednesdai night __PUNCT__ it is go to take more than a few year for us to solv challeng that have built up for decad __PUNCT__
we know that __PUNCT__
todai we learn that after lose __NUM__ job a month when i took offic __PUNCT__ busi ad job for the __NUM__ month in a row __PUNCT__
we ad more than __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__
but we know that that not good enough __PUNCT__
we can do better __PUNCT__
we need to creat job even faster __PUNCT__
we need to fill the hole left by thi recess __PUNCT__
we need to come out of thi crisi stronger than when we went in __PUNCT__
i don't want to just get back to where we were in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i want us to do even better __PUNCT__
there is a lot more that we can do __PUNCT__
and when congress get back to town next week __PUNCT__ you don't need to call dave loebsack __PUNCT__ he alreadi on the program __PUNCT__ but you can tell some of these other congressmen to give middl class famili and small busi the confid thei need by tell them that their tax will not go up next year __PUNCT__
everybodi agre we shouldn't rais tax on the middl class __PUNCT__ so let get that done __PUNCT__ and let get it done now __PUNCT__
what the hold up __PUNCT__ what the wait __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ we could creat a million addit new job if thi congress would pass the job bill i sent them a year ago __PUNCT__ job for teacher and construct worker and folk who have been out there look for work for a long time __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__ but i need your help __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__
i need your voic __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
you got it __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
sai __PUNCT__ i want to make thi point __PUNCT__
at our convent __PUNCT__ i wasn't just ask for your vote __PUNCT__
i wa ask us to ralli around an achiev set of goal for our countri __PUNCT__ goal in manufactur and energi and educ and nation secur and defens __PUNCT__
real __PUNCT__ concret goal that will lead to new job and more opportun and rebuild thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
that what we can do in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ for those of you who miss it last night __PUNCT__ let me just repeat what i want us to do __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i got a plan to export more product around the world and outsourc fewer job around the world __PUNCT__
so the good new is after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ america ha creat over half a million manufactur job in the last 2Â½ year __PUNCT__
we reinvent the dy auto industri __PUNCT__
it now back on top of the world __PUNCT__
so we need to build on that progress __PUNCT__ and you got a choic __PUNCT__
you can go along with the other folk and give more tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that ar invest in new plant and equip and train new worker and creat new job right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
you can make that happen __PUNCT__
but i go to need your help __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i got a plan to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei and it will help our environ __PUNCT__
and we doubl the us of renew energi __PUNCT__ especi here in iowa __PUNCT__
we got thousand of american who have job todai build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__ between the other gui __PUNCT__ who want to revers on that progress __PUNCT__ or those of us who want to build on it __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i will not let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
i not go to let them collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__
i want to keep invest in wind and solar __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and truck __PUNCT__
i want to put construct worker back to work build home and factori that wast less energi __PUNCT__ and retrofit build so that thei us less energi __PUNCT__
and we can develop a hundr year __PUNCT__ suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet and do it in an environment sound wai __PUNCT__
and if you choos thi path __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import by half in __NUM__ and support more than __NUM__ new job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
but i go to need you to keep move forward on thi energi agenda __PUNCT__
we can't go backward __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thi is great __PUNCT__ but you haven't even heard the third thing yet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ number three __PUNCT__ i got a plan to give more american like you the chanc to gain the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa the gatewai for opportun for me __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai for opportun for michel __PUNCT__
all of you who ar student here understand thi is the ticket to a middl class life __PUNCT__
so what we done over the last 3Â½ year __PUNCT__ for the first time in a gener __PUNCT__ nearli everi state ha answer our call to rais standard for teach and learn __PUNCT__
some of the worst school in the countri have made real gain in math and read __PUNCT__
million of student __PUNCT__ mayb some of you __PUNCT__ ar pai less for colleg todai becaus we final took on a system that wa wast billion of dollar on bank and lender __PUNCT__
we cut out the middleman __PUNCT__ let give those loan directli to student __PUNCT__
the monei we save allow us to help million of more student and keep student loan and grant out there for folk __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
you can go with the other folk __PUNCT__ plan __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and gut educ __PUNCT__ or we can decid that here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ nobodi should have their dream set asid becaus of a crowd classroom or a crumbl school __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find the right skill here at home __PUNCT__
that not the futur for america __PUNCT__
we got to have the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
we know how to do it __PUNCT__ we just got to stai with it __PUNCT__
so help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
let improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
let give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to get the skill thei need at local commun colleg __PUNCT__
and let help keep tuition low at colleg and univers all across the countri __PUNCT__ becaus you gui deserv to have the chanc to succe __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is about __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__
but let me tell you the fourth thing __PUNCT__ you love me even more __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ fourth __PUNCT__ my plan would reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
independ analysi ha shown that my plan would cut deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
and i alreadi work with the republican in congress to cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__ becaus those of us who care about what govern can do to help peopl give them a ladder up __PUNCT__ we got to make sure that the monei is well spent __PUNCT__ and some program aren't work __PUNCT__
we got to get rid of them __PUNCT__
we got to make sure that govern is lean and effici and provid good servic to the american peopl __PUNCT__
so i will to do more __PUNCT__ but i want to make sure that we also reform our tax code so that it simpl and fair and so that we ask the wealthiest household in america to pai higher incom __PUNCT__ or higher tax on incom over __MONEY__
now __PUNCT__ that mean that if you make more than __NUM__ you still get a tax break on the first __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it just mean that after you make addit monei __PUNCT__ you pai the same rate we paid when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ the same rate we had when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we had the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
that make sens for america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the other side __PUNCT__ sinc everyth is cure by a tax cut __PUNCT__ especi for wealthi american __PUNCT__ so far thei balk __PUNCT__
thei refus my offer to work with them on thi __PUNCT__
but thi week __PUNCT__ presid clinton point out that the singl biggest miss from my oppon plan is arithmet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it doesn't add up __PUNCT__
governor romnei and hi alli in congress tell us that somehow we can lower our deficit __PUNCT__ thei sai that the deficit is the most import thing __PUNCT__
thei sai thi is vital for our futur __PUNCT__
but when you ask them __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ what your plan __PUNCT__ thei sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we first go to start by take __MONEY__ trillion out of the economi and give it to folk like me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ take it out of treasuri __PUNCT__ rather __PUNCT__ and give it to me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ somehow __PUNCT__ it all go to creat prosper for the rest of you __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you do the math __PUNCT__
if you want to lower the deficit __PUNCT__ but we spend __MONEY__ trillion on tax cut for folk who don't need it and weren't even ask for it __PUNCT__ how is that go to work __PUNCT__ the fact is the number in mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan don't add up to lower deficit __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ thei don't add up to more job either __PUNCT__ becaus the economist have actual said that my oppon plan would make the recoveri slower __PUNCT__ not faster __PUNCT__
so i not go along with that plan __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__ just so those with the most can pai less __PUNCT__
and i will never turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__ becaus no american should have to spend their golden year __PUNCT__ after year of labor __PUNCT__ at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with the care and the digniti that thei have earn __PUNCT__
we can strengthen and reform medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by just dump the cost on senior __PUNCT__ ask them to pai thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
and we go to keep the promis of social secur by take the respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ not by turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai rebuild thi economi is essenti __PUNCT__
that prioriti number on __PUNCT__
but our prosper at home is link to polici abroad __PUNCT__
so __NUM__ year ago i promis we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we ar __PUNCT__
and as a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ and bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus no american who fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that thei earn when the come home __PUNCT__
so just like there a choic on domest polici __PUNCT__ there a choic when it come to foreign affair __PUNCT__
my oppon said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and while my oppon would spend more monei on militari program that the joint chief sai we don't need __PUNCT__ won't make us safer __PUNCT__ don't want __PUNCT__ i go to us that monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__
becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__ iowa __PUNCT__
that what we need to focu on __PUNCT__
thi is the choic we now face __PUNCT__
thi is what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
i said yesterdai __PUNCT__ over and over again __PUNCT__ we been told by our oppon that bigger tax cut and fewer regul ar the onli wai to go __PUNCT__ that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ their theori is __PUNCT__ i hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if compani ar releas toxic pollut into the air __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that just the price of progress __PUNCT__
that their theori __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ take my oppon advic and borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that hi theori __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
when i look at all these young peopl here __PUNCT__ i remind of what is essenti about thi countri __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we insist on person respons __PUNCT__
we insist on individu initi __PUNCT__
everybodi here know we not entitl to success __PUNCT__
we have to earn it __PUNCT__
and we honor entrepreneur and businesspeopl __PUNCT__ striver __PUNCT__ the dreamer __PUNCT__ the risk taker who ar the drive forc behind our free enterpris system __PUNCT__
and we believ that the free enterpris system is the greatest engin of growth and prosper that the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but we also believ that thi countri onli work when we accept certain oblig to on anoth and to futur gener __PUNCT__
we understand that as citizen __PUNCT__ america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ it about what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
and nobodi understand that better than the peopl of iowa __PUNCT__ becaus the elect __NUM__ year ago wasn't about me __PUNCT__
it wa about you __PUNCT__
the chang that start here in iowa __PUNCT__ the chang that start here in iowa citi __PUNCT__ you were the chang __PUNCT__
you the reason that there some littl girl out there with a heart disord who is now go to get surgeri that she need becaus an insur compani can't limit her coverag __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason that student right here at the univers of iowa ar go to be abl to graduat colleg with the secur of know that you can stai on your parent health insur plan __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason there a young teacher in boon __PUNCT__ who ha a littl more time to pai back her colleg loan so that she can start her life do what she love without be buri by debt __PUNCT__
you made that possibl __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr __PUNCT__ who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag __PUNCT__ will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason why we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__

you the reason __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ you the reason __PUNCT__
and so if you turn back now __PUNCT__ if you bui into the cynic that you hear all the time that sai somehow the chang we fought isn't possibl __PUNCT__ well then __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ chang won't happen __PUNCT__
if you stop __PUNCT__ chang won't happen __PUNCT__
you ar what bring it about __PUNCT__
if you give up on the idea that your voic make a differ __PUNCT__ then other voic fill the void __PUNCT__ the special interest __PUNCT__ the lobbyist __PUNCT__ the folk who write __MONEY__ million check to run all those neg ad __PUNCT__ the peopl who ar try to make it harder for you to vote __PUNCT__ the politician who want to decid who you can marri or want to control health care choic that women should be make for themselv __PUNCT__
