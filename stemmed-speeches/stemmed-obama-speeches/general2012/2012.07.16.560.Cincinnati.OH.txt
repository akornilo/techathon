todai we ar turn thi beauti music hall into a town hall __PUNCT__
so i not go to take too much time up front __PUNCT__
i want to spend as much time as possibl answer some of your question and get your comment __PUNCT__
but i do want to just sai a few thing about what at stake here __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and republican __PUNCT__ who were interest in restor the basic bargain that made america the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
we got so much to be thank for __PUNCT__ incred land and an incred militari __PUNCT__
our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ thei do so much for us all the time __PUNCT__
and there obvious great wealth in thi nation __PUNCT__
but what realli set us apart ha alwai been that we got the greatest middl class and a basic idea that at the heart of thi countri that sai if you work hard __PUNCT__ then you can get ahead __PUNCT__
if you respons __PUNCT__ then you can live out your dream __PUNCT__ you not confin to the circumst of your birth __PUNCT__
a basic belief that if you do what you need to do __PUNCT__ becaus we not a countri that believ in handout __PUNCT__ we believ in work for what we get __PUNCT__ that you abl to find a job that support a famili __PUNCT__ get a home that you can call your own __PUNCT__ that you abl to send your kid to get a good educ and __PUNCT__ hopefulli __PUNCT__ allow them to go to colleg and thei can achiev and succe in wai you might not have even imagin __PUNCT__ that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ that you be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
that the idea that built thi countri __PUNCT__
that the idea that turn us into a econom powerhous __PUNCT__
and what we saw for about a decad befor i took offic wa the sens that that dream wa slip awai from too mani peopl __PUNCT__ becaus peopl were work harder __PUNCT__ but thei were get less __PUNCT__
incom and wage were flatlin __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from colleg to health care to groceri to ga were all go up __PUNCT__
so our goal wa to turn thi around __PUNCT__ and we knew it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__
we knew that it might take more than on term __PUNCT__ mayb more than on presid __PUNCT__
but we knew that we had to get start to reclaim thi dream __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ what we discov wa that becaus of irrespons __PUNCT__ becaus of econom polici that had fail and a lack of oversight when it came to regul __PUNCT__ we inherit the worst financi crisi and the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and million of peopl were hurt __PUNCT__ lost their job __PUNCT__ lost their home __PUNCT__ lost their save __PUNCT__
and a lot of folk ar still struggl __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__
american ar alwai tougher than tough time __PUNCT__
and thi crisi ha not chang our charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what we believ in __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang that basic notion that everybodi should get a fair shot and everybodi should do their fair share and everybodi should plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
and so even though over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ our central focu ha been how do we recov from thi crisi and get peopl back to work and make sure that small busi ar do well again and that thei get financ __PUNCT__ despit all those thing __PUNCT__ our goal ha not just been to get back to where we were befor the crisi struck __PUNCT__ but rather to build an economi that last __PUNCT__ to build an economi that sai no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try here in america __PUNCT__
everyth i done sinc i been presid ha been focus on thi central issu __PUNCT__
that the reason i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ part of the reason i here todai __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
part of the reason that i here todai is i want to remind everybodi that the challeng we face ar solvabl __PUNCT__
the problem is not a lack of big idea __PUNCT__
it not a lack of technic solut to our polici issu __PUNCT__
the problem is we got a stalem right now in washington __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ between two fundament differ idea about how we move the countri forward __PUNCT__
thi elect is about more than just two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__ it about two differ vision about how do we build a strong economi __PUNCT__
and the good new is you the tiebreak __PUNCT__
the choic is up to you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ the choic is up to you __PUNCT__
governor romnei and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ in an econom theori that sai __PUNCT__ if folk at the veri top ar do realli well __PUNCT__ then that spread to everybodi els __PUNCT__
it what we call top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
so right now their main prescript for grow the economi faster is an addit __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut __PUNCT__ most of which would go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ even if to pai for it you have to gut educ program or turn medicar into a voucher program or elimin our invest in basic research and scienc __PUNCT__
that their vision about how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
thei actual got a two __PUNCT__ part vision __PUNCT__
on is tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ the second is elimin regul that we put in place to make sure __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ that wall street doesn't engag in the same reckless behavior that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ it would be on thing if thei had thi theori and we hadn't tri it befor __PUNCT__
but the truth is we tri it for almost a decad __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
the track record of their vision result in turn surplus into deficit __PUNCT__
we ran two war on a credit card __PUNCT__
job growth wa the most sluggish it been in decad __PUNCT__
the averag wage and incom of work famili actual went down dure thi period __PUNCT__ and it culmin in thi massiv crisi __PUNCT__
so i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but in my life __PUNCT__ what i found __PUNCT__ sometim i do bonehead thing __PUNCT__ i make mistak __PUNCT__
what i find is when i don't __PUNCT__ when i try someth and it doesn't work __PUNCT__ then i don't try it again __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ you don't go back to do someth that didn't work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
so for exampl __PUNCT__ governor romnei said he would extend the tax cut for the wealthiest american indefinit __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
he sai that until he put a tax plan in place __PUNCT__
but hi tax plan is not just to keep all the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
as i said __PUNCT__ he want to put anoth __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ thi is estim that it almost imposs for you to bring down the deficit and deal with the debt with that kind of tax plan __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ percent of these new tax would go to the top __NUM__ percent of all household __PUNCT__
we have not found ani seriou econom studi that sai governor romnei econom plan would actual creat job __PUNCT__ until todai __PUNCT__
i got to be honest __PUNCT__
todai we found out there a new studi out by nonpartisan economist that sai governor romnei econom plan would __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
there onli on problem __PUNCT__ the job wouldn't be in america __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei would not be in america __PUNCT__
thei be in other countri __PUNCT__
by elimin tax on corpor __PUNCT__ foreign incom __PUNCT__ governor romnei plan would actual encourag compani to shift more of their oper to foreign tax haven __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ job in those other countri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi shouldn't be a surpris __PUNCT__ becaus governor romnei experi ha been invest in what were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of the busi of outsourc __PUNCT__
now he want to give more tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
so i want everybodi to understand __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ i got a differ theori __PUNCT__
we don't need a presid who plan to ship more job oversea or want to give more tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that ar invest right here in ohio __PUNCT__ that ar invest in cincinnati __PUNCT__ that ar invest in hamilton counti __PUNCT__
i want to give incent to compani that ar invest in you __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__ to creat american job __PUNCT__ make american good that we sell around the world __PUNCT__ stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the differ extend not just to the differ in corpor tax __PUNCT__ it also individu tax __PUNCT__
we don't need a presid who is go to give himself a big tax break __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we need a presid who is go to cut your tax __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut tax for the middl class __PUNCT__ and i kept that promis __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ you did __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the typic famili tax burden is __MONEY__ lower than it wa when i came into offic __PUNCT__
i want all the press to notic that __PUNCT__
becaus sometim __PUNCT__ you hear all these crazi accus __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ is rais tax __PUNCT__ burden __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ here ar the fact __PUNCT__
typic middl class famili __PUNCT__ your tax have gone down __MONEY__ sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__
a coupl week ago __PUNCT__ i call on congress to immedi extend these tax cut to __NUM__ percent of the american peopl __PUNCT__
folk make __MONEY__ a year or less would not see their tax go up on singl dime __PUNCT__ their incom tax go up on singl dime __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i should point out __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ percent of small busi also would not see their tax go up __PUNCT__ becaus typic __PUNCT__ thei don't earn more than __MONEY__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ and i am __PUNCT__ i didn't __PUNCT__ michel and i didn't us to be __PUNCT__ now we ar __PUNCT__
we been bless __PUNCT__
that great __PUNCT__
what we sai is for those folk __PUNCT__ we can afford to pai a littl bit more in tax by go back to the rate that were paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
that will help us reduc our deficit by about a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
and everybodi sai the deficit and the debt ar import __PUNCT__ and i agre __PUNCT__
and i just want to point out __PUNCT__ the last time we did that __PUNCT__ when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ we had surplus __PUNCT__ not deficit __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ we creat a lot of millionair and billionair to boot __PUNCT__
becaus when an economi is grow from the middl out and from the bottom up __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__ includ peopl at the veri top __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
when teacher and firefight and polic offic and construct worker __PUNCT__ when folk who ar put in a hard dai work __PUNCT__ when thei do well __PUNCT__ then everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that how america ha alwai succeed __PUNCT__
we believ in individu initi and self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__
but there some thing we do togeth __PUNCT__ and grow an economi is on of them __PUNCT__
my grandfath __PUNCT__ he went to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
that gener help to expand the middl class __PUNCT__ and everybodi did better __PUNCT__
when we invest in the hoover dam or the golden gate bridg or the internet __PUNCT__ send a man to the moon __PUNCT__ all those thing benefit everybodi __PUNCT__
and so that the vision that i want to carri forward __PUNCT__
that why when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps and governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ i said no __PUNCT__
on out of eight job in ohio depend on the auto industri __PUNCT__ a million job across the midwest ar at stake __PUNCT__
i go to bet on american worker and american ingenu __PUNCT__
and now gm is back on top __PUNCT__ and chrysler and ford ar on the move __PUNCT__
and the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so let me just close by sai thi __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ we can get to some question __PUNCT__
my vision sai we go to invest in educ and we go to hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__ open up __NUM__ million more slot for folk to go to commun colleg to get train in the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
we alreadi help to make sure that student __PUNCT__ student loan rate didn't doubl __PUNCT__ but now we got to work more to lower tuition cost so young peopl aren't burden with debt __PUNCT__
so we go to invest in educ __PUNCT__
we go to invest in american energi __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we want to continu to expand our product of oil and natur ga __PUNCT__ but i also want to make sure that we ar the leader in solar and wind and biodiesel __PUNCT__ the energi of the futur that can help reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
american manufactur __PUNCT__ chang our tax code __PUNCT__ provid incent for compani to invest here __PUNCT__ invest in basic research and scienc so that we ar at the cut edg __PUNCT__ becaus whoever ha got the best technolog will ultim have the best economi __PUNCT__
we got to make those invest __PUNCT__
rebuild our infrastructur __PUNCT__ i know you got some bridg around here that need repair __PUNCT__
you got some road that need a repair __PUNCT__
let put construct worker back to work __PUNCT__
i end the war in iraq as i promis __PUNCT__
we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we decim al qaida __PUNCT__
let now take half the monei we were spend on war and do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__

and wherev i go __PUNCT__ what i alwai struck by is the core decenc and good and hard work and respons and faith that the american peopl have __PUNCT__
so i alwai bet on the american peopl __PUNCT__
and i confid that if we work hard __PUNCT__ we get our messag out __PUNCT__ we have an honest debat about what need to happen in thi countri and what futur is best for our children and our grandchildren __PUNCT__ then we go to finish what we start in __NUM__ __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so try to keep the question to on that we can be succinct about __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ and i go to start with thi young ladi right here in the __PUNCT__ sort of __PUNCT__ the pink __PUNCT__ white blous __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ right there __PUNCT__

q __PUNCT__
can you stand with me __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
oh __PUNCT__ is that the birthdai boi __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
okai __PUNCT__ i didn't __PUNCT__ he get a lot of attent todai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ go ahead __PUNCT__
civil right of lesbian __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ bisexu __PUNCT__ and transgend person q __PUNCT__
okai __PUNCT__
my name is anna __PUNCT__ and my son is openli gai __PUNCT__
and he is grassroot __PUNCT__ and he speak for a lot of the lgbt commun __PUNCT__
and we like to know __PUNCT__ sinc you ar for the lgbt __PUNCT__ what your next step __PUNCT__ what ar you go to do for us __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ i think what the american peopl have seen and made such progress on is recogn the idea of equal right __PUNCT__ equal digniti __PUNCT__ equal respect for everybodi __PUNCT__
that appli to everybodi __PUNCT__
that is a bedrock principl of america __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ when i came into offic __PUNCT__ everyth from make sure that same __PUNCT__ sex coupl could have visit in hospit just like everybodi els __PUNCT__ make sure that we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ becaus fight for the countri you love should not depend on who you love __PUNCT__ be clear that doma is someth that we should repeal __PUNCT__ across the board i tri to constantli align myself with what is best in our tradit __PUNCT__ and that is __PUNCT__ you treat everybodi fairli __PUNCT__
american ar about fair __PUNCT__
and that doesn't mean that folk have to agre with everybodi on everyth __PUNCT__
we don't __PUNCT__
but we want to treat everybodi fairli __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think it import to recogn __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ that our gai and lesbian brother and sister ar still subject to discrimin __PUNCT__
that why we pass hate crime legisl __PUNCT__ and we still got to fight for that __PUNCT__
i think it is import for us to respect decis that state make with respect to expand treatment of same __PUNCT__ sex coupl and marriag __PUNCT__
but also what i want to sai is that gai and lesbian famili ar like everybodi els __PUNCT__ what thei realli also worri about right now is make sure thei can pai the bill __PUNCT__
so my strong belief is that it is import for us to focu on individu issu of fair __PUNCT__ but also recogn that we all have common interest as well __PUNCT__
your son is __NUM__ __PUNCT__ i assum he go to get some more educ __PUNCT__ and i assum you gui ar worri right now about make sure he doesn't come out with a whole bunch of debt __PUNCT__ and how __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__ miami __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
miami __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__ miami __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
miami of ohio __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__

congratul __PUNCT__
we got some folk from the alma mater here __PUNCT__
so we want to treat everybodi fairli __PUNCT__ and we also want to make sure that the economi treat everybodi fairli __PUNCT__
and i go to be fight for that as long as i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__
thi gentleman right here __PUNCT__
doe anybodi have a mike over there __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__ right behind __PUNCT__ veri good __PUNCT__
i impress __PUNCT__
there you go __PUNCT__
oil and ga production/environment protect q __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ i jim o'reilli __PUNCT__
ten year as an elect citi offici ha shown me a real chang in what the republican parti ha been do to us __PUNCT__
thei taken awai our power to protect our natur resourc __PUNCT__ water and air __PUNCT__ from the strength of the oil and ga driller that ar do frack here in ohio __PUNCT__
i support what lisa jackson and the epa ar do __PUNCT__
is there more the administr can do to protect us from the advers effect of drill for natur ga __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
good __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ thi is a great question __PUNCT__ and it an import question __PUNCT__
a coupl of thing i just want everybodi to know __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ if you hear anybodi sai that somehow we ar imped the develop of our energi resourc here in thi nation __PUNCT__ i want you to know these fact __PUNCT__ oil product __PUNCT__ higher than it been in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ natur ga product __PUNCT__ higher than it been probabl in our lifetim __PUNCT__ oil import __PUNCT__ actual lower than thei been in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ our oil import ar less than __NUM__ percent now for the first time in a veri long time __PUNCT__
and so we move in the right direct in term of energi independ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ part of that is thi boom in natur ga __PUNCT__
and thi is someth we should welcom __PUNCT__ becaus not onli ar we bless with incred natur ga resourc that ar now access becaus of new technolog __PUNCT__ but natur ga actual burn cleaner than some other fossil fuel and is an ideal fuel __PUNCT__ energi sourc that we potenti can us for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
so i want to encourag natur ga product __PUNCT__
the kei is to make sure that we do it safe and in a wai that is environment sound __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you alwai hear these argument that somehow there thi huge contradict between the environ and econom develop or the environ and energi product __PUNCT__
and the fact of the matter is that there ar a lot of folk right now that ar engag in hydraul frack who ar do it safe __PUNCT__
the problem is __PUNCT__ is that we haven't establish clear guidelin for how to do it safe and inform the public so that neighbor know what go on __PUNCT__ and your famili __PUNCT__ you can make sure that ani industri that oper in your area __PUNCT__ that thei be respons __PUNCT__
so what we said is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we ar go to work with industri to establish best practic __PUNCT__
we ar go to invest in the basic research and scienc requir to make sure thi is done safe and in a wai that protect the public health __PUNCT__
and for respons compani __PUNCT__ thei should be abl to oper __PUNCT__ make a profit __PUNCT__ and we can all benefit and put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
but if you an irrespons compani that not do the right thing __PUNCT__ we go to hold you to account __PUNCT__
and that how we should develop thi incred resourc __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ if we do it properli __PUNCT__ could end up chang the econom and polit global of energi in a wai that actual veri good for us __PUNCT__ becaus we be less depend on what happen in the middl east and our economi will be less subject to the kind of spike that we saw earlier in the spring in term of ga price __PUNCT__
thank you for the question __PUNCT__

the presid __PUNCT__
absolut __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__
and also __PUNCT__ when can i cut your hair __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ let me answer the second question first __PUNCT__
you know that you would not want a presid who is disloy to hi barber __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ a man and hi barber __PUNCT__ that a strong connect __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__
i know __PUNCT__ i know __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
so i am not go to let you cut my hair becaus my barber would be hurt __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__
just on time __PUNCT__ just on time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
mayb i let you give me a line __PUNCT__ a littl bit __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we can do that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ in term of small busi __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ small busi ar the lifeblood of our economi __PUNCT__
thei account for most of the new job growth __PUNCT__
we got obvious great big busi __PUNCT__
in thi area __PUNCT__ proctor gambl is an exampl of an outstand larg busi __PUNCT__
but a lot of the job growth happen with small busi __PUNCT__ who then becom medium __PUNCT__ size busi and then mayb at some point becom larg busi __PUNCT__
so ever sinc i came into offic __PUNCT__ on of my biggest prioriti wa how do we support small busi __PUNCT__ which is why we actual provid __NUM__ differ tax break just target at small busi sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__
it the reason why we have push the small busi administr __PUNCT__ especi when the recess had just hit __PUNCT__ to extend addit financ and to waiv fee for small busi __PUNCT__ becaus on of the biggest challeng for small busi is get credit line __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ it is __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
and we actual been push the bank to sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ taxpay pull your backsid out of the fire __PUNCT__ it now import for you to step up and make sure that small busi aren't find their credit restrict __PUNCT__ especi if thei been in busi for a while __PUNCT__
the other thing we done is to sai __PUNCT__ what ar the critic need of small busi __PUNCT__ a lot of time __PUNCT__ on of the biggest challeng is to make sure that you __PUNCT__ as a sole proprietor __PUNCT__ that you can get health insur for you and your famili __PUNCT__
so when you hear about the afford care act __PUNCT__ obamacar __PUNCT__ and i don't mind the name becaus i realli do care __PUNCT__
that why we pass it __PUNCT__
you should know that you __PUNCT__ onc we have fulli implement __PUNCT__ you go to be abl to bui insur through a pool so that you can get the same good rate as a group that __PUNCT__ if you an employe at a big compani __PUNCT__ you can get right now __PUNCT__ which mean your premium will go down __PUNCT__
we will also give you addit tax credit if you ar provid health insur for your employe __PUNCT__ we give you tax credit for that __PUNCT__
right now on of the thing we push congress to do is to give you a tax credit if you hire addit worker or you give folk who ar a work for you a rais __PUNCT__
we want to give you incent to do that __PUNCT__
but thi is an exampl of where there a contrast between myself and my oppon __PUNCT__
as i said befor __PUNCT__ hi basic tax plan is to give folk at the top a tax break __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we can have that debat __PUNCT__ but what i said is __PUNCT__ in the meantim __PUNCT__ let give __NUM__ percent of individu and __NUM__ percent of small busi some certainti right now by go ahead and pass a law that sai your tax won't go up __PUNCT__
becaus if congress doesn't act __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ by __DATE__ everybodi tax here ar go to go up __PUNCT__ by an averag of about __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ if congress doesn't do anyth __PUNCT__
and so what i said is if you realli want to help small busi right now __PUNCT__ give __NUM__ percent of them the certainti that their cost will not go up __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ we can have a debat about the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on last point i go to make on thi small busi and tax argument __PUNCT__ you hear republican sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ if you tax __PUNCT__ let sai __PUNCT__ somebodi with a million dollar of incom __PUNCT__ you go to be crush the small __PUNCT__ busi job creator __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i just explain __NUM__ percent of small busi make less than __NUM__ a year __PUNCT__
but set asid that __PUNCT__ the wai thei describ small busi __PUNCT__ half of the fortun __NUM__ richest american in the countri would qualifi as a __PUNCT__ small busi __PUNCT__
hedg fund manag would qualifi as small busi __PUNCT__ even if thei were pull in a billion dollar a year __PUNCT__
and my __PUNCT__ thi is an exampl of what i mean when i sai we just want everybodi to be treat fairli __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
michel and i were talk the other dai __PUNCT__ and michel dad work as a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__
he wa at the water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__ work there all hi life __PUNCT__ all hi adult life __PUNCT__
and he had ms __PUNCT__ so by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai of work __PUNCT__
he had to us two cane __PUNCT__
he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els just to get dress __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai of work __PUNCT__
and he took pride in be at the job __PUNCT__ even if he didn't feel well __PUNCT__
and he us to teas folk who were lazi __PUNCT__ he sai __PUNCT__ these peopl ar so lazi thei won't even go to work to pick up their paycheck __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei want it mail to them __PUNCT__
and michel mom __PUNCT__ she stai at home when the kid were young __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ she went to work as a secretari __PUNCT__
and she work as a secretari most of her adult life __PUNCT__
so the point is __PUNCT__ thei didn't have a lot __PUNCT__
but michel and i were talk about how thei didn't envi peopl who had a lot more __PUNCT__
there wa no sens that somehow our live ar less becaus we not millionair __PUNCT__ we not make huge amount of monei __PUNCT__
god bless folk who ar do success __PUNCT__ who ar success and do well __PUNCT__
the onli thing that michel parent __PUNCT__ my mom __PUNCT__ my grandpar __PUNCT__ the onli thing thei didn't like is when you felt like folk at the top were take advantag of their posit and not follow the same rule as everybodi els and keep other folk down __PUNCT__
and we don't want an economi in which some ar be treat differ than other __PUNCT__
that all __PUNCT__
and that especi true when it come for our small __PUNCT__ busi folk __PUNCT__
i want them to have some of the same advantag __PUNCT__ becaus you probabl can't afford the same number of lawyer and account and all that stuff that ar work all these loophol __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that you get the same good deal as everybodi els __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__

my name is susan __PUNCT__
welcom to cincinnati __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
__NUM__ presidenti and congression elect q __PUNCT__
given how divid the countri is __PUNCT__ if elect __PUNCT__ how do you plan to try to unit everyon __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i be honest __PUNCT__ sometim peopl ask me what my disappoint sinc i come into offic __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ we alwai try to grow the economi faster __PUNCT__ put peopl back to work faster __PUNCT__
but on of the disappoint i had is that we have not chang the tone in washington the wai i want to __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ part of thi just ha to do with the fact that the other side had a basic econom __PUNCT__ or a basic polit theori after i got elect __PUNCT__ and thi is not my opinion __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thi ha been said by the leader of the senat minor in washington __PUNCT__
and the basic theori wa __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ we kind of screw thing up __PUNCT__ obama is realli popular right now __PUNCT__ if we cooper with him __PUNCT__ then he get credit __PUNCT__ so we better off just sai no __PUNCT__
and if we do that __PUNCT__ then over time __PUNCT__ folk will forget the mess he inherit and we can go after him __PUNCT__ and hopefulli __PUNCT__ that will help our polit __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ thi is not my theori __PUNCT__
thi is explicitli their strategi __PUNCT__
what true is also we got __PUNCT__ as i said __PUNCT__ two differ vision about how to move the countri forward __PUNCT__
but my hope is that thi elect allow us to __PUNCT__ onc and for all __PUNCT__ resolv some of the bigger question about how we move the countri forward __PUNCT__ becaus right now we got as stark a choic as you could imagin __PUNCT__
i believ in invest in educ and transport and scienc and research and bring down our deficit in a balanc wai __PUNCT__ and chang our tax code to make sure that compani that ar invest here ar do better __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei ha the opposit view on almost all those posit __PUNCT__
on thing like __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei want to revers my posit __PUNCT__
on issu like immigr __PUNCT__ i believ in comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__ he doe not __PUNCT__
on issu relat to women __PUNCT__ i believ that plan parenthood doe a lot of good __PUNCT__ and that women health __PUNCT__ women should be abl to control their own health care decis __PUNCT__
he doe not __PUNCT__
on iraq __PUNCT__ he said me end the war wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__
i said i think it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
on afghanistan __PUNCT__ i impos a deadlin __PUNCT__ a timet for when we go to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
he want to extend their stai indefinit __PUNCT__
so on all these issu __PUNCT__ we got just profound differ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you gui ultim ar the arbit of thi disagr __PUNCT__
and in thi elect __PUNCT__ if the american peopl decid you know what __PUNCT__ we want to try what mr __PUNCT__ romnei is offer __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ that the great thing about democraci __PUNCT__ is peopl can vote and make up their mind __PUNCT__
and so if that the case __PUNCT__ then you can count on mr __PUNCT__ romnei implement the plan that he and the republican in congress have put forward __PUNCT__
so __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut __PUNCT__ massiv cut in a lot of the program that ar so import __PUNCT__ from my perspect __PUNCT__ to grow the economi __PUNCT__ those will be elimin __PUNCT__
medicar will be voucher __PUNCT__
thei will implement what thei sai thei go to implement __PUNCT__
but if i elect __PUNCT__ not onli do i think that we be abl to continu the progress that we made over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ i actual think that a lot of republican __PUNCT__ sinc thi will be my last elect __PUNCT__ thei will not be as interest in just beat me and mayb thei be more interest in move the countri forward __PUNCT__
that my hope __PUNCT__
and i have to sai __PUNCT__ the truth is on most of these issu __PUNCT__ there shouldn't be so much partisan rancor __PUNCT__ becaus most of the posit i taken ar posit that us to be support by republican __PUNCT__
and if you want just on good exampl __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__
the bill i pass is in all respect similar to what mr __PUNCT__ romnei pass in massachusett __PUNCT__
it work realli well there __PUNCT__
he should be proud of it instead of run awai from it __PUNCT__
and the origin idea of us the privat sector to make sure that everybodi had health care __PUNCT__ that origin as a republican idea __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ fine __PUNCT__ i will to work with your idea to make progress __PUNCT__
so i actual think that there ar a number of republican member of congress who right now feel as if thei got to toe the parti line __PUNCT__
but if the object is no longer just beat me __PUNCT__ my hope is that thei be more open to find commonsens solut to the problem that our countri face __PUNCT__
and i know that is absolut a goal of mine __PUNCT__ becaus in the end __PUNCT__ we ar not democrat or republican first __PUNCT__ we ar american first __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__
i got time for two more question __PUNCT__
thi gentleman in the blue shirt right there __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ i end over here __PUNCT__
come on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ go ahead __PUNCT__
educ q __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ my name is jeff whitesel __PUNCT__ and i have been teach for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
congratul __PUNCT__
q __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
i teach at a vocat school __PUNCT__ career tech school __PUNCT__
and my question to you is __PUNCT__ we been talk about job __PUNCT__ we been talk about kid __PUNCT__ we talk about __PUNCT__ i know you want everi kid to go to colleg __PUNCT__ but not everi kid is go to go to colleg __PUNCT__
we need peopl to work __PUNCT__
we need peopl to be plumber and build bridg and those kind of thing __PUNCT__
and what i want to __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i believ it __PUNCT__ i realli do __PUNCT__
we do miracl at our school __PUNCT__
we take kid who have had realli rough live and we make them product __PUNCT__
but the problem is __PUNCT__ is that thei ar not get enough chanc to get to go to work right awai __PUNCT__
we have advisori board __PUNCT__ but these advisori board ar free __PUNCT__ and thei __PUNCT__ these peopl ar not get paid __PUNCT__
what we need __PUNCT__ and i wa hope that you could tell us if thi is someth in your agenda __PUNCT__ can we have peopl come in __PUNCT__ give tax break to these compani to come and help school to teach the school what thei realli need for these kid __PUNCT__ and that what i __PUNCT__ that what we look for __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ thank you for teach __PUNCT__
most import job there is __PUNCT__
we appreci that __PUNCT__
second of all __PUNCT__ i want to be veri clear __PUNCT__
when i sai everybodi need a higher educ __PUNCT__ i don't mean everybodi ha got to take a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year colleg educ __PUNCT__
the point is that __PUNCT__ these dai __PUNCT__ if you want to be a plumber __PUNCT__ if you want to be an electrician __PUNCT__ you want to be work in a factori __PUNCT__ you ar gener go to need a littl bit more train than high school provid __PUNCT__ which is why our commun colleg system is so import __PUNCT__
but you ar absolut right that on of the __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ mistak we made __NUM__ year ago wa to start deemphas vocat educ __PUNCT__ becaus not everybodi want to sit in a classroom with a book __PUNCT__
a lot of folk want to do stuff __PUNCT__
and right now we got shortag of folk in field that need technic train __PUNCT__ but don't necessarili requir a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year colleg degre __PUNCT__
and so part of what i talk to secretari of educ arn duncan about is how do we work with high school so that young peopl who got an aptitud __PUNCT__ whether it in graphic design or in electron __PUNCT__ or you name it __PUNCT__ that thei can start get on a pathwai so that thei ar be train for the job that actual exist now __PUNCT__ thei be match up with compani that ar hire now __PUNCT__
thei mayb start apprent junior __PUNCT__ senior year in high school __PUNCT__ mayb it extend to anoth year or two in commun colleg __PUNCT__
and by the time thei __NUM__ thei ar expert in field where we know there is hire take place right now __PUNCT__
so it veri import __PUNCT__
we go to be work with state __PUNCT__ local govern __PUNCT__ school district __PUNCT__ and commun colleg to try to figur out how we can expand what is alreadi a proven idea in a lot of place around the countri __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ you and i __PUNCT__ we right there __PUNCT__
we think the same wai __PUNCT__
and i look forward to see if we can make progress on thi __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ last question __PUNCT__
i promis __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i go to call on thi young ladi right here __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ thi is the last question __PUNCT__ and we got to get a mike to her __PUNCT__
but it nice to see you __PUNCT__ young man __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that a good __PUNCT__ look young man __PUNCT__ isn't he __PUNCT__ he a handsom young gui __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ go ahead __PUNCT__
unemploy rate/job creation q __PUNCT__ hi __PUNCT__
my father __PUNCT__ he an unemploi construct worker __PUNCT__ and he on unemploy __PUNCT__
so as your job as presid __PUNCT__ will he have a job befor hi unemploy run out __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thi is an import question __PUNCT__
what your name __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__ taylor __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
taylor __PUNCT__
how old ar you __PUNCT__ taylor __PUNCT__ q __PUNCT__
i will be __NUM__ in __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ so nice to meet you __PUNCT__ and i glad you think about your dad __PUNCT__ becaus i know he want to work __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
that my granddaught __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
my hope is __PUNCT__ is that we can put him to work __PUNCT__
hous took the biggest hit in our economi becaus you had thi big hous bubbl that collaps __PUNCT__ so the construct industri __PUNCT__ the industri where your dad work __PUNCT__ wa the hardest hit of ani industri __PUNCT__
and it the on that been the slowest to come back __PUNCT__ which is why __PUNCT__ sinc __DATE__ of last year __PUNCT__ i have urg congress to expand our effort to rebuild road __PUNCT__ bridg __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ lai broadband line go into rural commun __PUNCT__ make sure that all these folk __PUNCT__ like your father __PUNCT__ who want to work __PUNCT__ these aren't folk who ar look for a handout __PUNCT__ thei want to be on the job __PUNCT__ so that thei have an opportun to do work that we go to have to do anywai __PUNCT__
and thi is import __PUNCT__
how mani folk here have a hous and you know that you got a leaki roof __PUNCT__ do you __PUNCT__ you can put off patch up that leaki roof __PUNCT__ but sooner or later __PUNCT__ you go to have to patch it up __PUNCT__
sooner or later __PUNCT__
and if you don't __PUNCT__ what happen __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
fall in __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
it fall in __PUNCT__
and then what happen __PUNCT__ it more expens __PUNCT__
same is true if you got a bust boiler __PUNCT__
so we all have what call defer mainten __PUNCT__
we can't alwai do it right awai __PUNCT__ but a lot of time __PUNCT__ if we have an opportun to do it __PUNCT__ we should go ahead and do it __PUNCT__ especi if it cheap __PUNCT__
it is cheaper now to do it than it will be later __PUNCT__
interest rate ar low __PUNCT__
construct worker ar out of work __PUNCT__
contractor ar beg for work __PUNCT__
thei come in on time __PUNCT__ under budget __PUNCT__
and so we could knock out a whole bunch of work that need to get done for thi countri anywai and put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ which would grow the economi right now __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ so far __PUNCT__ i have not gotten a posit respons from member of congress on the other side of the aisl __PUNCT__
thei did just pass __PUNCT__ and thi wa a sign of some modest cooper __PUNCT__ so it make me feel a littl bit encourag __PUNCT__ thei did just pass a transport bill that at least wouldn't lai off more construct worker __PUNCT__
but the first thing i want to do wa put your dad back on the job rebuild america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if your father still doesn't get a job __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ part of what i also look for is make sure that unemploy insur is there for folk who want to work __PUNCT__ but ar have troubl find work __PUNCT__
and i want folk to be clear __PUNCT__ unemploy insur __PUNCT__ unemploy benefit __PUNCT__ thei paid for __PUNCT__
your employ paid for them __PUNCT__
directli and indirectli __PUNCT__ you paid for them __PUNCT__
the idea is to have that safeti net becaus everybodi onc in a while can have some bad luck __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we tri to extend unemploy insur beyond normal right after the recess hit __PUNCT__
we were abl to extend it again in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it been harder now to get congress to extend it further __PUNCT__
and i don't know exactli what categori your father fall in __PUNCT__ but my bottom line is __PUNCT__ my gener view is that as long as the economi is weak and somebodi is will and abl to work __PUNCT__ and look for work activ __PUNCT__ which is what requir if you want to get unemploy insur __PUNCT__ then we should be there for them to make sure that thei can pai the rent and look after their famili __PUNCT__
and so we continu to negoti with congress to make sure that unemploy is there __PUNCT__
but the most import thing i want to do is make sure your dad can get a job __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ let me just sai __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__ i am go to be back in cincinnati __PUNCT__
i go to be back in ohio __PUNCT__
i want to thank you for your attent __PUNCT__
and i want to explicitli ask you for your support __PUNCT__
thi is go to be a close elect __PUNCT__
thi is go to be a close elect __PUNCT__ and it is go to be an import debat __PUNCT__
and i want everybodi to understand that what i tri to do over the last 3½ year is to keep my promis __PUNCT__
so i promis i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i end it __PUNCT__
i promis that we would keep tax low for middl class famili __PUNCT__ i did that __PUNCT__
but the most import promis i made __PUNCT__ some of you rememb me sai thi in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ you know i not a perfect man __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ i wasn't go to be a perfect presid __PUNCT__ no presid is __PUNCT__
but what i promis you wa that i would alwai tell you what i thought __PUNCT__ i alwai tell you what i believ __PUNCT__ and i would wake up everi singl dai fight as hard as i knew how for you __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ i have kept that promis __PUNCT__
becaus when i look around thi room __PUNCT__ if i see an elderli coupl i think about my grandpar and everyth thei did for me __PUNCT__
