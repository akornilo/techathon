__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i know it couldn't have been mitt romnei becaus the real mitt romnei ha been run around the countri for the last year promis __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut that favor the wealthi __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ the fellow on the stage last night __PUNCT__ who look like mitt romnei __PUNCT__ said he did not know anyth about that __PUNCT__
it wa all new to him __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the real mitt romnei said that we don't need ani more teacher in the classroom __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

but the fellow on stage last night __PUNCT__ he said he love teacher __PUNCT__ can't get enough of them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the mitt romnei we all know invest in compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc job to other countri __PUNCT__
but the gui on stage last night __PUNCT__ he said he never heard of tax break for compani that shift job oversea __PUNCT__ never heard of them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ if that true __PUNCT__ he must need a new account __PUNCT__
so now we know for sure that wasn't the real mitt romnei __PUNCT__ becaus the real mitt romnei is do just fine with the account that he alreadi ha __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ whoever it wa that wa on stage last night doesn't want to be held account for what the real mitt romnei ha been sai for the last year __PUNCT__ and that becaus he know full well that we don't want what he been sell over the last year __PUNCT__
governor romnei mai danc around hi posit __PUNCT__ he mai do a tapdanc and a two __PUNCT__ step __PUNCT__ but if you want to be presid __PUNCT__ then you ow the american peopl the truth __PUNCT__
so here the truth __PUNCT__ governor romnei cannot pai for hi __MONEY__ trillion tax plan without blow up the deficit or stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
we can't afford to go down that road again __PUNCT__
we can't afford anoth round of budget __PUNCT__ bust tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__
we can't afford to gut our invest in educ or clean energi or research or technolog __PUNCT__
we can't afford to roll back regul on wall street bank or oil compani or insur compani __PUNCT__
we can't afford to doubl down on the same top __PUNCT__ down econom polici that got us into thi mess __PUNCT__
that is not a job plan __PUNCT__
it not a plan for our economi __PUNCT__
it not a plan to strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__
it is not chang __PUNCT__
it is a relaps __PUNCT__ and we not go to do it __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__
we have tri that __PUNCT__
we ar not go back __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
becaus i got a differ view __PUNCT__ we have a differ view about how to creat job and prosper __PUNCT__
thi countri doesn't succe when onli the rich get richer __PUNCT__
we succe when everybodi ha a shot __PUNCT__ when the middl class is get bigger __PUNCT__ when there ar ladder of opportun into the middl class __PUNCT__
our economi doe not grow from the top down __PUNCT__ it grow from the middl out __PUNCT__
that how it grow __PUNCT__
we don't believ that anybodi is entitl to success in thi countri __PUNCT__ but we do believ in opportun __PUNCT__
we do believ in a countri where hard work pai off and respons is reward __PUNCT__ where everybodi is get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
that the countri we believ in __PUNCT__
that what i been fight for __PUNCT__ for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
madison __PUNCT__ what we ar ralli around is a new econom patriot that is root in the core belief that built thi countri __PUNCT__ the belief that the economi grow when we have a strong and thrive middl class and everybodi who work hard ha a shot __PUNCT__
and there ar specif wai that we can do that __PUNCT__
i want to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
my oppon said we should let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
we came togeth __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
we came togeth to reinvent a dy auto industri that now back on top of the world __PUNCT__
we creat half a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__
and so we can keep give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that ar open new plant and train new worker right here in wisconsin __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that what we need to do __PUNCT__
i want to help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__ creat a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__
you can make that happen __PUNCT__ but you go to have to vote __PUNCT__
i want to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of do noth __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that good for your pocketbook __PUNCT__ that good for our economi __PUNCT__ and it also good for our environ __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi that we gener from sourc like wind and solar __PUNCT__
thousand of american have job todai build wind turbin __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic between a plan that revers thi progress __PUNCT__ as you heard last night __PUNCT__ or on that build on it __PUNCT__
the gui who wa plai mitt romnei said he refus to close a loophol that give big oil compani __MONEY__ billion in taxpay subsidi everi singl year __PUNCT__
doe anybodi think that oil compani need a tax subsidi right now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so we got a better plan __PUNCT__
we go to keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal __PUNCT__ and farmer and scientist can har biofuel to power our car and our truck and make our build and school more energi effici and develop our natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
and if we do all those thing __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we can support hundr of thousand of job all across the countri __PUNCT__
but you go to have to vote to make it happen __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that everi young person in america ha the chanc to get the skill __PUNCT__ the knowledg thei need __PUNCT__ to compet in thi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
educ is the onli reason i stand on thi stage __PUNCT__
it the onli reason michel wa abl to do what she did __PUNCT__
and so we haven't forgotten that we need some student loan to get through school __PUNCT__
that why over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we help million of student pai less for colleg becaus we final took on a system that wa wast billion of dollar on bank and lender __PUNCT__
we said __PUNCT__ let cut out the middleman __PUNCT__ let give the monei directli to student __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the gui plai mitt romnei last night sai he love educ __PUNCT__ but the budget that hi run mate __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ put forward __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
v ot __PUNCT__
would gut educ to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
that on path __PUNCT__
it the wrong path __PUNCT__
we need to decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom __PUNCT__ becaus of outdat textbook __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid an accept letter to go to the univers of wisconsin becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find ani with the right skill here in the unit state __PUNCT__
so i need you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ improv earli __PUNCT__ childhood educ __PUNCT__ give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn skill at the commun colleg that will lead directli to a job __PUNCT__
help us work with colleg and univers like thi on to cut the growth of tuition cost so that you gui aren't overburden with debt when you graduat __PUNCT__
that a goal we can meet __PUNCT__
we can choos that futur for america __PUNCT__
we go to have to do someth about the deficit __PUNCT__ but we got to do it in a smart wai __PUNCT__
i said i cut the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion through a mix of spend cut and higher tax on the wealthiest of american __PUNCT__
i alreadi work with republican to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__
i will to do more __PUNCT__
i want to reform the tax code so it simpl and it fair __PUNCT__
but i also go to ask the wealthiest among us to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ the whole economi doe well when tax ar kept low for middl class famili and work famili __PUNCT__ becaus when you gui have a littl extra monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ you spend it __PUNCT__
you have to __PUNCT__ on basic necess __PUNCT__
and that mean busi ha more custom and thei make more profit __PUNCT__
thei then hire more worker __PUNCT__ and the economi as a whole begin to grow __PUNCT__
but to do that and reduc the deficit at the same time __PUNCT__ we got to ask folk who can afford it to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ last night __PUNCT__ thi mai have actual been the real mitt romnei __PUNCT__ becaus he rule out rais a dime on tax on anyon ever __PUNCT__ no matter how much monei thei make __PUNCT__ rule out close those loophol that ar give __MONEY__ billion of corpor welfar to the oil compani __PUNCT__ refus to even acknowledg the loophol that give tax break to corpor that move job oversea __PUNCT__
when he wa ask what he would do to actual cut spend and reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ he said he elimin public televis fund __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so don't boo __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but i just want to make sure i got thi straight __PUNCT__
he get rid of regul on wall street __PUNCT__ but he go to crack down on sesam street __PUNCT__
thank good somebodi is final crack down on big bird __PUNCT__
who knew that he wa respons for all these deficit __PUNCT__ elmo ha got to watch out __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the fact is the gui plai mitt romnei last night __PUNCT__ hi math doesn't add up __PUNCT__
the onli wai to pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut and __MONEY__ trillion in new defens spend that the militari is not ask for is by either blow up the deficit or ask you to pai more __PUNCT__
and i refus to do that __PUNCT__
i not go to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american to pai for a tax cut we can't afford __PUNCT__
and i will not turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
i explain why yesterdai __PUNCT__
governor romnei doubl down on thi propos last night __PUNCT__ and he is wrong __PUNCT__
no american should ever have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with digniti and the care that thei earn __PUNCT__
so we can reform medicar the right wai by reduc health care cost __PUNCT__ not by ask senior to pai thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
and we will keep the promis of social secur __PUNCT__ strengthen it __PUNCT__ but we won't turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ madison __PUNCT__ we talk a lot about domest affair yesterdai __PUNCT__
but we go to have a chanc to talk about what happen abroad as well __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan in a respons wai __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
and becaus we were abl to refocu attent __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat and usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there still a lot of threat out there __PUNCT__
we saw that just __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ in the last coupl of week __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop take off the uniform __PUNCT__ we serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei have fought for america freedom __PUNCT__
we will honor that commit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't know who go to show up at the next debat __PUNCT__ but i do know that the real mitt romnei said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and i go to us the monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__
after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
so thi is the choic we face __PUNCT__
thi is what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
the other side will tell you that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if a compani is releas pollut into the air that your children breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
that not how our great wa built __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we understand it not about what can be done for us __PUNCT__
it about what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
you the reason the mother in green bai doesn't have to worri about her son be deni medic coverag becaus of a preexist condit __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you the reason a middl class famili in milwauke got a tax cut __PUNCT__ monei thei can us to bui groceri and put ga in the car and pai their bill __PUNCT__

and __PUNCT__ madison __PUNCT__ that why you can't bui into the cynic that is so preval __PUNCT__ the idea that the chang we fought for somehow isn't possibl __PUNCT__ becaus when that happen __PUNCT__ chang doesn't happen __PUNCT__
if you give up on the idea that your voic can make a differ __PUNCT__ then other peopl fill the void __PUNCT__ the well connect __PUNCT__ the lobbyist __PUNCT__ the folk who can write __MONEY__ million check to try to bui thi elect or the on who ar try to make it harder to vote __PUNCT__ washington politician who want to control health care choic that women ar perfectli capabl of make themselv __PUNCT__
