that what we believ __PUNCT__
that why you elect me in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ you have a choic to make __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i think you mai have notic that everybodi is pai a lot of attent to ohio __PUNCT__
and rightfulli so __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ thi is a choic not just between two candid or two parti __PUNCT__ it a choic between two fundament differ vision of america __PUNCT__
it a choic between go back to the top __PUNCT__ down polici that crash our economi or adapt the kind of polici that will make sure we got a strong and grow middl class __PUNCT__
that the choic __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we honor the striver and the dreamer and the risk taker __PUNCT__ the entrepreneur __PUNCT__ the small __PUNCT__ busi peopl __PUNCT__
thei the folk who have alwai been the drive forc behind our free enterpris system __PUNCT__ and it been the greatest engin of growth and prosper the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but we also believ in thi countri that peopl succe __PUNCT__ peopl start busi __PUNCT__ peopl work well in busi when thei got a decent educ __PUNCT__ when thei get a chanc to learn new skill __PUNCT__ when we support research into medic breakthrough or new technolog __PUNCT__
we think america is stronger when we can count on afford health care and medicar and social secur __PUNCT__ when there ar rule to protect our kid from toxic dump and mercuri pollut __PUNCT__
we think the market work better when consum ar protect from unscrupul practic in the credit card industri or from mortgag lender __PUNCT__
and we believ that no politician in washington should control health care choic that women can make for themselv __PUNCT__
these ar the thing we believ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we had a presid who share our belief __PUNCT__ and hi name wa bill clinton __PUNCT__
hi econom plan ask the wealthiest american to pai a littl more so we could reduc our deficit and invest in the skill and idea of our peopl __PUNCT__
and at the time the republican congress and a senat candid by the name of mitt romnei said that bill clinton plan would hurt the economi and kill job __PUNCT__ it turn out the governor math wa just as bad back then as it wa todai __PUNCT__
becaus by the end of presid clinton second term __PUNCT__ america had creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and incom were up __PUNCT__ and poverti wa down __PUNCT__ and we had the biggest surplu in our histori instead of deficit __PUNCT__
so we know the idea that we believ in work __PUNCT__
we know that their idea don't work __PUNCT__
for most of the last decad __PUNCT__ we tri what thei want to do __PUNCT__ give big tax cut to the wealthiest american that we couldn't afford __PUNCT__
we tri give insur compani and oil compani and wall street free rein to do whatev thei pleas __PUNCT__
and you know what we got __PUNCT__ fall incom __PUNCT__ record deficit __PUNCT__ the slowest job growth in half a centuri __PUNCT__ and an econom crisi that we been clean up after for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
so we know what we want to do work __PUNCT__
we know what thei want to do doesn't work __PUNCT__
we know what we want to do grow our middl class __PUNCT__ what thei want to do squeez the middl class __PUNCT__
we know that our strategi make sure that we bring our deficit down in a balanc wai __PUNCT__ their strategi end up shoot the deficit up __PUNCT__
so we know what the right choic is __PUNCT__
but let face it __PUNCT__ governor romnei __PUNCT__ he a veri talent salesman __PUNCT__
in thi campaign he tri as hard as he can to repackag these same polici and offer them up as chang __PUNCT__
but we know what chang look like __PUNCT__ and what the governor is offer ain't it __PUNCT__
give more power back to the biggest bank __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that favor the wealthi __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
refus to answer question about the detail of your polici until after the elect __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
we seen that befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ we seen that befor __PUNCT__
rule out compromis by pledg to rubber __PUNCT__ stamp the tea parti agenda in congress __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ when you try to chang the fact just becaus thei inconveni to your campaign __PUNCT__ that definit not chang __PUNCT__
try to massag the fact __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
that just __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we been see thi out of governor romnei and hi friend over the last few week right here in ohio __PUNCT__
you got folk who work at the jeep plant who have been call their employ worri __PUNCT__ ask is it true __PUNCT__ ar our job be ship to china __PUNCT__ and the reason thei make these call is becaus governor romnei ha been run an ad that sai so __PUNCT__
except it not true __PUNCT__
everybodi know it not true __PUNCT__
the car compani themselv have told governor romnei to knock it off __PUNCT__
gm said __PUNCT__ we think creat job in the unit state should be a sourc of bipartisan pride __PUNCT__
and i couldn't agre more __PUNCT__
and i understand that governor romnei ha had a tough time here in ohio becaus he wa against save the auto industri __PUNCT__
and it hard to run awai from that posit when you on videotap sai the word __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
and i know we close to an elect __PUNCT__
but thi isn't a game __PUNCT__
these ar peopl job __PUNCT__
these ar peopl live __PUNCT__
these car compani ar put a lot of effort to make great product __PUNCT__ but also to make sure that everybodi in america know how commit thei ar to make car here in america __PUNCT__
and so you don't scare hard __PUNCT__ work american just to scare up some vote __PUNCT__
that not what be presid is all about __PUNCT__
that not leadership __PUNCT__
when i first made the decis to rescu the auto industri __PUNCT__ i knew it wasn't popular __PUNCT__
and despit the fact that on out of eight job in ohio ar connect to the auto industri in some wai __PUNCT__ it wasn't even popular in ohio __PUNCT__
but i knew it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
i knew bet on american worker wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
bet on american ingenu and know __PUNCT__ how wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
that paid off __PUNCT__
it paid off in lordstown __PUNCT__ where gm is invest hundr of million of dollar in their auto plant __PUNCT__
it paid off in toledo __PUNCT__ where chrysler is ad more than a thousand new job on a second shift __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__ right here in ohio __PUNCT__ right here in unit state of america __PUNCT__
and so on of the thing i hope when you talk to your friend and your neighbor __PUNCT__ thei try to make up their mind these last few dai __PUNCT__ think about that __PUNCT__
think about the issu of trust __PUNCT__ think about do you want a presid who is go to actual tell you what he believ and what he think or somebodi who is go to __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
lie __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ who go to __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ chang the fact __PUNCT__

and let me tell you __PUNCT__ when i hear folk sai hire more teacher won't help thi economi grow __PUNCT__ thei ar wrong __PUNCT__
becaus if we got great teacher in the classroom __PUNCT__ that go to help our kid __PUNCT__ and it go to help our economi __PUNCT__
don't tell me that student who can't afford colleg should just borrow more monei from their parent __PUNCT__
that wasn't an option for me __PUNCT__ it wasn't an option for a lot of you __PUNCT__
that why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i want to recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher so that our kid don't fall behind the rest of the world __PUNCT__
i want to train __NUM__ million american at our commun colleg with skill that busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__

todai __PUNCT__ the great new about the auto industri is we not just build car again __PUNCT__ we build better car __PUNCT__ innov car __PUNCT__ car that by the middl of the next decad will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ here in ohio __PUNCT__ it not just car that we start to manufactur again __PUNCT__
we build long __PUNCT__ last batteri and wind turbin all across ohio __PUNCT__ all across the countri __PUNCT__
we got to keep our cut __PUNCT__ edg technolog and research and innov and invest __PUNCT__
and i don't want a tax code that subsid oil compani profit when thei make monei hand over fist __PUNCT__ i want to support the energi job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ the new technolog that will help cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__
and i don't want a tax code that reward compani for creat those job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to reward compani that ar creat job in manufactur right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that my plan __PUNCT__
that what real chang is __PUNCT__
chang is turn the page on a decad of war so we can do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
as long as i command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ we will pursu our enemi with the strongest militari that the world ever known __PUNCT__
but it time to us the save from end the war in iraq and wind down the war in afghanistan to pai down our debt and rebuild america __PUNCT__ repair road and bridg and school all across ohio __PUNCT__ all across america __PUNCT__
and let especi focu on put our veteran back to work as thei come home __PUNCT__
we need to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
that my commit __PUNCT__
chang is a futur where we do reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but we do it in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
i alreadi sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend cut __PUNCT__ i intend to do more __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about the deficit __PUNCT__ we also have to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the rate that thei paid when bill clinton wa in offic __PUNCT__
becaus if i not pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ and governor romnei is not pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ then the choic is to start cut out help for young peopl try to go to school __PUNCT__
it to hurt folk who ar vulner and depend on thing like medicaid __PUNCT__
as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i will never turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to make it more expens for some young person who is work hard try to go to school __PUNCT__
i not go to make them pai more just so i get a tax break that i don't need __PUNCT__
i not go to cut out some research grant to some outstand young scientist that could have the next discoveri for cancer just becaus i want a tax cut that i don't need __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__ and we know it won't be easi __PUNCT__

thei spent million try to stop us from reform the health care system __PUNCT__
thei spent million try to keep us from reform wall street __PUNCT__
thei engin a strategi of gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that both democrat and republican in the past have support __PUNCT__

if you want to break the gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ you vote for leader who feel the same wai whether thei democrat __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ or independ __PUNCT__
but i not just go to cut a deal that kick student off of financi aid or get rid of fund for plan parenthood or let insur compani discrimin against peopl with preexist condit or elimin health care for million on medicaid who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__
