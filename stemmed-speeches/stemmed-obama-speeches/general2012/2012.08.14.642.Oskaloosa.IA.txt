in some wai __PUNCT__ thi is even more import an elect than __NUM__ becaus thi choic could not be bigger __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two polit parti __PUNCT__
it is a choic between two fundament differ vision of how america becam great and how it go to stai great __PUNCT__ two fundament differ vision of the path we need to take for the futur of our kid and our grandkid __PUNCT__
and the direct that you choos when you walk into the vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ it go to determin not just our live next year or __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__
it go to determin the futur for decad to come for our kid and our grandchildren __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ when we came togeth __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ we had independ __PUNCT__ and we had some republican __PUNCT__ we came togeth becaus a lot of us realiz that the core idea __PUNCT__ the basic bargain that made thi countri wa under threat __PUNCT__
and it a basic bargain that sai if you work hard in thi countri __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__ that if you take respons __PUNCT__ then you can make it __PUNCT__ that you can get into the middl class __PUNCT__ you can feel a sens of secur __PUNCT__ that you can find a job that pai the bill and have a home you call your own __PUNCT__ that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ that you can retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ that you can give your kid a great educ and thei can do even better and dream even bigger than you ever imagin __PUNCT__
that the american promis __PUNCT__
that the american dream __PUNCT__
that what we been fight for __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we knew restor that basic idea wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__ becaus we had just gone through a decad in which that bargain __PUNCT__ that promis wasn't be kept __PUNCT__
job had gotten ship oversea __PUNCT__
peopl were work harder but make less __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from health care to colleg wa go up __PUNCT__
we fought two war on a credit card __PUNCT__ ad enorm to our debt __PUNCT__
and all thi culmin then in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and so we knew thi wasn't go to be easi __PUNCT__
and when the crisi hit in __NUM__ and __NUM__ million of peopl all across thi countri __PUNCT__ some of our friend and neighbor and famili member __PUNCT__ lost their job __PUNCT__ lost their home __PUNCT__ lost their save __PUNCT__
and that made the american dream even a littl bit further out of reach __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i told you when i ran the first time that thi wa not go to be easi __PUNCT__ restor that bargain __PUNCT__ that there weren't ani quick fix to our solut __PUNCT__
but what i also insist __PUNCT__ and what i still believ __PUNCT__ is we got everyth we need to solv these challeng __PUNCT__
we have everyth we need right here in america to make the middl class strong again __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
everybodi know we got the best farm in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best research __PUNCT__
we got the best univers __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg __PUNCT__
we ar a young nation still __PUNCT__ partli becaus we still a magnet for talent from all around the world __PUNCT__
we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu of ani other countri __PUNCT__
and so even though there ar some peopl who like to talk about american declin or thei try to paint thing as dark as possibl __PUNCT__ especi dure elect season __PUNCT__ there is no doubt in my mind that there not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't gladli trade place with us __PUNCT__
we got everyth we need to succe __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ what we got is the american charact __PUNCT__
i seen it over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__
i see it in folk who lose their job at the ag of __NUM__ or __NUM__ and thei go back to a commun colleg __PUNCT__ studi hard __PUNCT__ sit next to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ and retrain __PUNCT__ and suddenli __PUNCT__ thei go back __PUNCT__ and thei get a job in a new industri __PUNCT__
or the small __PUNCT__ busi owner who could bare keep their door open but decid __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ i not go to take a salari __PUNCT__ i not go to take ani pai __PUNCT__ becaus i want to make sure my worker ar taken care of becaus thei got famili to support __PUNCT__
all across america __PUNCT__ it turn out american ar tougher than ani tough time __PUNCT__
we ar resili __PUNCT__ and we work hard __PUNCT__ and we mai get knock down but we alwai get back up __PUNCT__
that ha been the charact of america __PUNCT__ and that charact ha not chang __PUNCT__
and it becaus of that charact that over the last 3½ year we made some progress __PUNCT__
we not all the wai back to where we need to be __PUNCT__ but we creat 4½ million new job __PUNCT__ half a million new job in manufactur __PUNCT__
we have seen small busi start to open back up __PUNCT__
we seen worker get retrain and get rehir __PUNCT__
and so we made progress __PUNCT__
but our goal in __NUM__ wasn't just get back to where we were befor the crisi __PUNCT__
our goal wa to make sure that we built an economi that last __PUNCT__ where we built an economi where middl class folk and folk aspir to the middl class can succe __PUNCT__
that ha been our goal __PUNCT__
that what we still fight for __PUNCT__
we ar not yet done __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__ becaus we got more work to do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i said we got everyth we need to solv our problem __PUNCT__
the main impedi we got __PUNCT__ the main roadblock we got is polit in washington __PUNCT__
you got anoth parti that think compromis is a dirti word and that believ the onli wai we can move forward is to go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__
you right __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you mai have heard that governor romnei just chose hi run mate __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
he a good man __PUNCT__ he a famili man __PUNCT__
he the ideolog leader of the republican in congress __PUNCT__ and he an articul spokesperson for governor romnei view __PUNCT__
the problem is those view ar wrong __PUNCT__
i fundament disagre with their vision for america __PUNCT__
their basic prescript for america is to get rid of more regul on big bank and big corpor __PUNCT__ give more tax break to the veri wealthiest american __PUNCT__ and their belief is somehow that prosper then will trickl down on everybodi els __PUNCT__
that their view __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of governor romnei entir econom plan __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of it __PUNCT__ hi main idea __PUNCT__ hi on big idea __PUNCT__ is to give anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut on top of the bush tax cut that he keep in __PUNCT__ he want to keep in place __PUNCT__
five trillion dollar __PUNCT__
to give you some sens of perspect __PUNCT__ our entir defens budget is about half a trillion dollar a year __PUNCT__
so thi tax cut would be the equival of what we spend on the nation defens everi singl year for the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ we found out that he expect you to pai the tab __PUNCT__
governor romnei tax plan would actual rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__ to pai for thi big tax break that go mostli to the wealthiest folk __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
understand __PUNCT__ thi is not ask you to pai more tax to reduc our deficit or to help kid get an educ or to rebuild some road and bridg and port around the countri __PUNCT__
thi is ask you to pai more to give an averag __MONEY__ tax break to folk make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
that is hi big idea __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thei have tri to sell thi kind of trickl __PUNCT__ down fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and frankli __PUNCT__ thei tri it as recent as __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and what did we get __PUNCT__ the most sluggish job growth in gener __PUNCT__ incom and wage go down __PUNCT__ job go oversea __PUNCT__ and a huge econom crisi __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ the deficit kept on go up __PUNCT__ so by the time i walk into offic __PUNCT__ we had a trillion __PUNCT__ dollar deficit __PUNCT__
why would we want to try that again __PUNCT__ i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but my gener rule is __PUNCT__ if i do someth and it doesn't work __PUNCT__ and then i do it again and it doesn't work again __PUNCT__ i stop do it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i stop do it __PUNCT__
i try someth els __PUNCT__
so thei don't have a plan to cut the deficit __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
thei sure don't have a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for folk like me __PUNCT__ folk who ar do fine __PUNCT__
we need tax relief for work american __PUNCT__
so when i came into offic __PUNCT__ i had promis you that i would cut tax for middl class american __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ i kept that promis __PUNCT__
the republican like to call democrat the big tax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ spend folk __PUNCT__ but it turn out that your tax rate ar lower by about __MONEY__ for the typic famili than thei were when i came into offic becaus i kept my promis __PUNCT__
so now what i want to do is to keep your incom tax rate exactli where thei ar __PUNCT__
i don't want your tax go up for the first __MONEY__ of incom that you make __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ cover about __NUM__ percent of all american and __NUM__ percent of all small busi __PUNCT__
your tax __PUNCT__ your incom tax would not go up on singl dime next year if congress doe what i ask them to do __PUNCT__
what i have said is __PUNCT__ for those who ar fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still get a tax cut for the first __MONEY__ you make __PUNCT__ but after that we ask you to pai a littl bit more to help pai down the deficit and help to invest in make colleg afford for young peopl and make sure that we got teacher on the job and make sure that we invest in scienc to help cure cancer and alzheim __PUNCT__
that is how __PUNCT__ that how our economi can grow __PUNCT__
that how our economi will grow __PUNCT__
we go to make sure govern doe it part __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl don't realiz we alreadi cut a trillion dollar of govern spend to lower our deficit __PUNCT__ a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
and we can do more __PUNCT__
i think govern ha to make sure that it good steward for your taxpay dollar __PUNCT__ that it not be wast __PUNCT__
and there still more wast that we can get out of there __PUNCT__
but we can't close the deficit and invest in our futur just by cut tax for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ cut educ __PUNCT__ cut the thing that help us grow __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the propos that i put forward that sai folk like me and governor romnei have to pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ we actual have tri that __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
we tri it under bill clinton __PUNCT__ when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ folk at the top __PUNCT__ thei did good too __PUNCT__
and the reason is __PUNCT__ when you give a famili farmer or you give a construct worker or you give a receptionist or you give a nurs or a teacher a littl bit more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
thei spend it __PUNCT__
mayb thei final trade in that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car and get a new car __PUNCT__
mayb thei get a new applianc becaus the dishwash __PUNCT__ or the wash machin broken __PUNCT__
mayb thei bui a new comput for their kid who ar about to go to colleg __PUNCT__
mayb thei go to a restaur or __PUNCT__ heaven forbid __PUNCT__ take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__
and what that mean is then busi have more custom and busi hire more worker and everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
you get what call a virtuou cycl of everybodi feel more confid about the economi becaus everybodi ha got a stake in the economi __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i don't believ in an economi from the top down __PUNCT__ i believ that the economi grow from the middl class out and from the bottom up __PUNCT__
and when everybodi is do well and everybodi got a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi end up do better __PUNCT__
that how we grow thi economi __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so there __PUNCT__ there ar differ in thi elect on almost everi issu __PUNCT__
when the automak were on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and 3½ year later __PUNCT__ the auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so now i want to make sure that american manufactur __PUNCT__ advanc high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur __PUNCT__ is take root right here in america __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__ not in germani __PUNCT__ right here in iowa __PUNCT__ right here in oskaloosa __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
oskaloosa __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ governor romnei __PUNCT__ he like to brag about hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__
hi main privat sector experi __PUNCT__ he did make a lot of monei __PUNCT__ wa invest in compani __PUNCT__ some of which were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
i don't want a pioneer of outsourc __PUNCT__
i want somebodi who is fight for insourc __PUNCT__
i want to bring busi back to america __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give them to compani that ar invest right here in iowa and right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ make american product that we sell around the world stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that what i believ in __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
let me give you anoth exampl __PUNCT__
we at a moment right now when homegrown energi __PUNCT__ like wind energi __PUNCT__ is creat new job all across iowa and all across the countri __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ governor romnei said let end the tax credit for wind energi product __PUNCT__
let get rid of them __PUNCT__
he said that new sourc of energi like wind ar __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
hi run mate call them a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
dure a speech a few month ago __PUNCT__ governor romnei even explain hi energi polici thi wai __PUNCT__ i quot here __PUNCT__ you can't drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that what he said about wind power __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ you can't drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't know if he actual tri that __PUNCT__
i know he had other thing on hi car __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but if he want to learn someth about wind __PUNCT__ all he got to do is pai attent to what you been do here in iowa __PUNCT__
if he saw what you been do __PUNCT__ he see that there ar place like newton __PUNCT__ where a few year ago the maytag plant close down __PUNCT__ job dri up __PUNCT__
folk ar now back to work manufactur these enorm new tower and blade for some of the most sophist __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tech wind turbin on the planet __PUNCT__
the wind industri now support __NUM__ job here in iowa __PUNCT__ __NUM__ job across the countri __PUNCT__
these job aren't a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
these ar good job __PUNCT__ and thei a sourc of pride that we need to fight for __PUNCT__
and if he __PUNCT__ if governor romnei understood what you been do __PUNCT__ he know that we us to have to import most of the part that were us for wind turbin __PUNCT__
thei now be made here in america __PUNCT__ by american worker in american factori __PUNCT__
that not __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__ that real __PUNCT__
that part of what we fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__
if he knew what you been do __PUNCT__ he know that __NUM__ percent of iowa electr now come from wind __PUNCT__ power our home and our factori and our busi in a wai that is clean and renew __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ over the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we doubl the amount of electr america gener for wind __PUNCT__
across america __PUNCT__ we built the equival of __NUM__ new hoover dam __PUNCT__ worth of wind energi __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
so governor romnei mai have figur out that you can't drive a car with a windmil on it __PUNCT__ but he doesn't seem to know that america now ha enough wind turbin instal to gener enough electr from wind to power nearli __NUM__ million home with clean energi __PUNCT__
that how we leav someth better for the next gener __PUNCT__
that worth fight for __PUNCT__
that what at stake right now __PUNCT__
so i want to stop give __MONEY__ billion in taxpay subsidi that ar go to oil compani that ar make huge profit and have been subsid for a hundr year __PUNCT__ and let keep on invest in the new homegrown energi that creat job right here in iowa __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we got a whole lot of differ between me and governor romnei __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
you better __PUNCT__ you ar better __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you ar better __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i got to sai __PUNCT__ i agre with that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ my idea ar __PUNCT__ at least __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
you ar the man __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ i said we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
we said that we go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
we ar now bring troop home from afghanistan __PUNCT__
america is safer and more secur than when i came into offic becaus of the extraordinari sacrific of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
that why we invest so much in make sure that the va is do it job __PUNCT__ make sure that our veteran get the benefit that thei have earn __PUNCT__
becaus thei shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their head after thei fought for us __PUNCT__
we got to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
but as thei now come home __PUNCT__ i want to take about half the monei that we save after a decad of war and let help put veteran and american back to work rebuild america __PUNCT__ do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let rebuild our port and our road and our bridg and our airport __PUNCT__
we can put folk back to work right now __PUNCT__
it good for the economi now __PUNCT__
it be good for the economi __NUM__ year from now and __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ i want to set up a veteran job corp that help local commun hire veteran for firefight and cop in commun that need them most __PUNCT__
those ar smart invest in the futur __PUNCT__
governor romnei mai have a differ idea __PUNCT__
i want to put folk back to work rebuild america __PUNCT__
and now is the time to do it __PUNCT__
hi other idea is __PUNCT__ let get it __PUNCT__ rid of obamacar __PUNCT__ he sai __PUNCT__ i go to __PUNCT__ kill it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ it true __PUNCT__ i do care __PUNCT__
so i don't mind folk call it obamacar __PUNCT__
and what i said is that in a countri as rich as our __PUNCT__ we should not see anybodi go bankrupt when thei get sick __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha now spoken __PUNCT__
we ar move forward with thi law __PUNCT__
six __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ half million young peopl can now stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__
insur compani can't deni you coverag becaus of a preexist condit __PUNCT__
insur compani can't drop your coverag when you need it the most __PUNCT__
for a lot of rural commun __PUNCT__ a lot of farmer __PUNCT__ it hard bui health insur on your own __PUNCT__ you now go to be abl to pool with other folk so you can get discount rate just like peopl who work for big compani __PUNCT__
that will help a lot of commun all across iowa __PUNCT__
so we not go to go backward and refight the same fight we had over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we go forward __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
we don't need to have those same argument in washington __PUNCT__
what we need to do is go ahead and implement thi law and make sure it work __PUNCT__
and if anybodi ha got good idea to help further lower health care cost __PUNCT__ i happi to work with them __PUNCT__
but we not go backward __PUNCT__
we go forward __PUNCT__
that what america need right now __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that we got the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
i want to help local commun hire the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__ give __NUM__ million more slot avail in commun colleg so peopl can get train for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to make colleg more afford for everi singl young person in america __PUNCT__
we alreadi done a lot of work make sure that thei get help __PUNCT__ but i also go to work with the colleg and univers to lower tuition onc and for all __PUNCT__
becaus a higher educ is not a luxuri in thi economi __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess __PUNCT__ and i want to make sure opportun ar open for everybodi __PUNCT__ not just for the few __PUNCT__
all these issu __PUNCT__ bring manufactur back __PUNCT__ help young peopl go to school __PUNCT__ give you more health care secur __PUNCT__ all these issu tie togeth __PUNCT__
it goe back to what made thi countri great __PUNCT__
when i think about my own life __PUNCT__ when i think about michel life __PUNCT__ we didn't come from wealth __PUNCT__
we didn't come from fame __PUNCT__
but we were lucki enough to be born in a countri where here __PUNCT__ everybodi get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi doe their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ you can make it here if you try __PUNCT__
