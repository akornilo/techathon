coupl of peopl i want to acknowledg who help to make thi dai possibl __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ your outstand mayor __PUNCT__ julian castro __PUNCT__
somebodi whose name i know you familiar with becaus we ar in the henri gonzalez convent center __PUNCT__ a great friend __PUNCT__ outstand leader __PUNCT__ great congressman __PUNCT__ charli gonzalez is in the hous __PUNCT__

and final __PUNCT__ our futuro fund cochair and a wonder friend and support __PUNCT__ henri munoz __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is my last campaign __PUNCT__
it true __PUNCT__ i term limit out __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and that got me think about some of my first campaign __PUNCT__
i know that charli and julian and other __PUNCT__ thei think back to your first campaign __PUNCT__
and back then __PUNCT__ i didn't have air forc on __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ didn't have a motorcad __PUNCT__ no helicopt __PUNCT__
i did the drive myself __PUNCT__ and we didn't even have mapquest __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i have to unfold the map __PUNCT__
and illinoi __PUNCT__ like texa __PUNCT__ is a big state __PUNCT__ so i have to travel all across the state __PUNCT__ and you go from urban neighborhood to rural commun __PUNCT__ suburb __PUNCT__
you meet folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__
and wherev i travel __PUNCT__ what i discov wa that there wa a common theme to everyon stori __PUNCT__
if i met an elderli coupl __PUNCT__ i think back to my grandpar and how my grandfath fought in patton armi in world war ii and my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when my grandfath came back home __PUNCT__ he wa abl to attend colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to bui their first home with an fha loan __PUNCT__
and i think about the distanc thei travel from the small town in kansa where thei had been born __PUNCT__
and if i met a singl mom i think about my mother __PUNCT__ who had to rais me and my sister basic by herself __PUNCT__ with some help from my grandpar __PUNCT__ becaus my father had left __PUNCT__ so that i didn't even know him __PUNCT__ and how she had to work and go to school and look after her kid __PUNCT__
but with the help of grant and scholarship __PUNCT__ she wa abl to get an outstand educ and __PUNCT__ more importantli from her perspect __PUNCT__ give me and my sister a great educ __PUNCT__
and i thought about how much that would be possibl in some other place __PUNCT__
and if i met a work famili __PUNCT__ i think about michel famili __PUNCT__
her dad had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ so by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__ had to us two cane __PUNCT__ and had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els to get dress befor go to work __PUNCT__
he work at a water filtrat plant __PUNCT__ blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__
and michel mom stai at home when the kid were young __PUNCT__ and then work as a secretari __PUNCT__
but michel dad __PUNCT__ despit hi disabl __PUNCT__ never miss a dai of work and went to everi danc recit and everi basketbal game and had just a great joi about him __PUNCT__
and so all across the state of illinoi __PUNCT__ i would be travel and i meet peopl __PUNCT__ and i sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ their stori is my stori __PUNCT__
and then when i began to run for presid __PUNCT__ i travel all across the countri __PUNCT__ includ here in texa __PUNCT__ i realiz __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the stori i been hear in illinoi __PUNCT__ those ar america stori __PUNCT__
and at the heart of that stori wa a basic idea __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ unlik ani other __PUNCT__ the basic bargain that bind us togeth is the idea that if we work hard __PUNCT__ if we respons __PUNCT__ then you can get ahead __PUNCT__ that you endow by our creator with certain inalien right __PUNCT__ life __PUNCT__ liberti __PUNCT__ but also the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__ not a guarante __PUNCT__ but the chanc to get ahead if you work hard __PUNCT__
and so gener after gener __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ grandpar toil against all odd __PUNCT__ understand that at some point thi hard work would pai off and thei could climb their wai into a middl class __PUNCT__
and that middl class didn't just have to do with how much monei you had in your bank account __PUNCT__
it had to do with the idea that you could alwai find a job that support a famili and you wouldn't go bankrupt when you got sick and you could bui a home to call your own and you could make sure your kid had a good educ __PUNCT__
mayb you take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__ noth fanci __PUNCT__ but time to spend with those you love __PUNCT__
and you could retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ you could expect that your children could aspir to thing that you never even imagin __PUNCT__
that wa the heart __PUNCT__ that is the heart __PUNCT__ of the american idea __PUNCT__ thi basic idea that no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
and in __NUM__ when i ran for presid and so mani of you support me __PUNCT__ we ran becaus we believ in that idea and we believ that that basic bargain had been frai __PUNCT__
we had seen a decad in which hard work wasn't pai off for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
so peopl were work harder than ever __PUNCT__ but the cost of live __PUNCT__ ga __PUNCT__ colleg __PUNCT__ health care __PUNCT__ all were go up __PUNCT__ incom __PUNCT__ wage flatlin __PUNCT__
we gone from surplu to record deficit __PUNCT__ job growth stagnant __PUNCT__
and so what compel us togeth to make thi effort wa specif issu __PUNCT__ but it wa also __PUNCT__ how do we get that idea back for the vast major of american __PUNCT__ and what we didn't know at the time wa __PUNCT__ is that we were look at the worst financi crisi in a gener __PUNCT__ the worst econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and so million of peopl were lose their job even as i wa wrap up the campaign __PUNCT__
and peopl lost their home __PUNCT__ and more and more folk struggl __PUNCT__ and it felt as if that dream wa slip even further awai __PUNCT__
but we have not been deter __PUNCT__
as much work as we still have to do __PUNCT__ over the last 3½ year that focu on how do we build a middl class that is strong and secur and grow __PUNCT__ that ha remain my central focu __PUNCT__
and as __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ and even as we creat 4½ million new job and __NUM__ job in manufactur and stabil the financi system __PUNCT__ all the step we taken __PUNCT__ without much cooper from the other side __PUNCT__ that still been our north star __PUNCT__
and what alwai help me everi singl dai move forward is the recognit and the belief and the understand that although the time have been tough __PUNCT__ the american peopl have been tougher __PUNCT__
and that for everyth that happen dure that financi crisi and the recess that follow __PUNCT__ america fundament charact did not chang __PUNCT__
peopl willing to work hard did not chang __PUNCT__
peopl abil to bounc back from advers had not chang __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ as we look out at the futur __PUNCT__ the question is __PUNCT__ how do we best fulfil that goal __PUNCT__ that aim that we set for ourselv in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ for all the progress we made __PUNCT__ we did not embark on thi journei just to get back to where we were in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we work hard becaus we want a countri where everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi do their fair share and everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
that why i ran for presid in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as we think about thi elect __PUNCT__ understand that the challeng we face ar solvabl __PUNCT__
sometim it fashion among the pundit to sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ america is in declin __PUNCT__ or our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__
you hear that period __PUNCT__
thi isn't the first time we heard that about america __PUNCT__
and i could not disagre more __PUNCT__ becaus there not a problem out there that we can't solv __PUNCT__
the problem is not that we don't have technic solut or big idea to tackl these challeng __PUNCT__
the problem is we got a stalem in washington right now __PUNCT__
and it more than just a differ between two candid __PUNCT__ more than just a differ between two polit parti __PUNCT__
it is two fundament differ vision about how to move america forward __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ that prosper come from the top down __PUNCT__
thei believ that if we keep in place the bush tax cut for the wealthiest american and then we add on top of that anoth __MONEY__ trillion of tax cut __PUNCT__ most of which would go to peopl who don't need tax cut and frankli aren't even ask for them __PUNCT__ if we do all that __PUNCT__ even if it mean gut educ invest __PUNCT__ even if it mean slash transport __PUNCT__ even if it mean that we not abl to take care of our veteran as effect __PUNCT__ even if it mean that we not invest in basic scienc and research __PUNCT__ even if it mean that medicar we got to voucher __PUNCT__ even if we do all those thing __PUNCT__ thei still believ that those tax cut that benefit folk at the top will result in everybodi be better off __PUNCT__
that their basic econom theori __PUNCT__
it not complic __PUNCT__
thei got on other element to it __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__
thei also sai thei want to elimin regul on insur compani and wall street bank __PUNCT__ regul we put in place to protect consum from unscrupul mortgag practic __PUNCT__ and that take regul off of pollut __PUNCT__
if we do those thing along with the tax cut __PUNCT__ the market will be freed up __PUNCT__ govern out of the wai __PUNCT__ and happi dai ar here again __PUNCT__
that their theori __PUNCT__
audienc member boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and don't take my word for it __PUNCT__ go to their web site __PUNCT__
look at the budget that wa pass by the hous republican __PUNCT__
that their theori __PUNCT__
that what it boil down to __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it is a theori __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and some of you might be persuad by thi theori if it hadn't been for the fact that we just tri it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we spent almost a decad do what thei prescrib __PUNCT__
and how did it turn out __PUNCT__ we didn't see greater job growth __PUNCT__
we didn't see middl class secur __PUNCT__
we saw the opposit __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi in our lifetim __PUNCT__ precis becaus there were no regul that were adequ to the kind of reckless that wa be carri out __PUNCT__
so i don't know about you __PUNCT__ i don't know how you gui oper in your life __PUNCT__ but my gener rule is if i do someth and it doesn't work __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i don't go back to do it __PUNCT__
we don't go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
so i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
i don't believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ i believ in middl __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__
i believ in bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
i believ in fight on behalf of work famili and give them opportun and put some monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ becaus when we do that __PUNCT__ everybodi doe better __PUNCT__ folk at the bottom __PUNCT__ folk in the middl __PUNCT__ and folk at the top __PUNCT__
that not a democrat idea __PUNCT__ that an american idea __PUNCT__
that what built thi countri __PUNCT__
that what made us into an econom superpow __PUNCT__
so let just be more specif about some contrast here __PUNCT__
my oppon thought it wa a good idea to __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
with a million job at stake __PUNCT__ i disagre __PUNCT__
i want to make a bet on america worker and american industri and american manufactur __PUNCT__
and 3½ year later __PUNCT__ the auto industri is back __PUNCT__
gm is number on __PUNCT__ ford and chrysler ar sell car __PUNCT__
that my vision for america __PUNCT__
and thi is not uniqu to the auto industri __PUNCT__
i want advanc manufactur locat here in san antonio __PUNCT__
i want us to be make thing here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ so i want to end tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give tax break to compani that ar invest right here in texa __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let put american worker back to work sell good stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that my vision for america __PUNCT__
my oppon ha a differ idea __PUNCT__
hi main call card for want to be presid is hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__
so we ask the voter to examin that experi __PUNCT__
he invest __PUNCT__ made monei invest in compani that have been call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ in outsourc __PUNCT__
i don't want pioneer of outsourc in the white hous __PUNCT__ i want somebodi who believ in insourc __PUNCT__
let bring those job back home __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i made a promis we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we end it __PUNCT__
i promis to go after bin laden __PUNCT__ we got him __PUNCT__
we transit out of afghanistan and start to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
and what i said is __PUNCT__ as we wind down these war __PUNCT__ let take half the monei that we spent on war to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__ let us the other half to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei disagre with me on thi __PUNCT__ said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ the wai i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ doesn't want to set a timet for end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ i look around thi countri and i know from our histori __PUNCT__ from world histori __PUNCT__ that no nation ha alwai been stronger than it economi __PUNCT__
that an issu of our nation defens __PUNCT__
and so becaus of our outstand men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ we know that we got the greatest militari on earth __PUNCT__ but we also have to have the best economi on earth to support those troop __PUNCT__
and that mean __PUNCT__ let start invest __PUNCT__ rebuild road and rebuild bridg and lai broadband line into rural commun __PUNCT__
let rebuild school that ar overcrowd and give them state __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ art scienc lab __PUNCT__
and let rebuild our port and our runwai __PUNCT__
that what america is about __PUNCT__ is rebuild __PUNCT__
and we got thousand of construct worker out there that ar readi to get to work __PUNCT__
let put them to work __PUNCT__
that will be good for our economi and __PUNCT__ over the long term __PUNCT__ will be good for our strength __PUNCT__
that a differ between myself and my oppon __PUNCT__
as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we go to make sure that our veteran ar properli care for __PUNCT__
and we have expand our fund and improv how we ar work with our veteran __PUNCT__
but we got more work to do __PUNCT__ and that requir resourc __PUNCT__
we sure not go to spend that monei better on tax cut for me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that a young man or woman who ha serv our countri __PUNCT__ who ha fought for us __PUNCT__ thei shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that america ha the best educ system on earth __PUNCT__ from pre __PUNCT__ k all the wai to postgradu __PUNCT__
and that mean hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
and it mean build on the work we alreadi done to make sure that student loan rate don't doubl __PUNCT__ to make sure that middl class famili ar get tuition tax credit __PUNCT__
now we got to reduc the cost of colleg __PUNCT__ make it more afford to everybodi __PUNCT__
i want to expand opportun for __NUM__ million young peopl to go to commun colleg so thei can get train on the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
becaus todai educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ todai a higher educ is an econom imper for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that the unit state of america onc again ha the highest percentag of colleg graduat becaus that is go to help determin who win the race in thi global economi in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and i want america to be number on __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
on almost everi issu __PUNCT__ there a stark contrast between my vision and my oppon __PUNCT__
when it come to hous __PUNCT__ he want to just let foreclosur bottom out __PUNCT__
i don't think that a solut __PUNCT__ that part of the problem __PUNCT__
so i want to actual help famili all across texa and all across the countri refin __PUNCT__ at these histor low rate __PUNCT__ the averag famili could save __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ in your pocket __PUNCT__
that will not just be good for you __PUNCT__ that will not just be good for the hous market __PUNCT__ that will be good for the economi __PUNCT__
but we need to get it done __PUNCT__
i don't want to go back to the dai when whether you could serv your countri or not depend on who you love __PUNCT__
we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ and i want to make sure that it stai end becaus it wa a bad idea __PUNCT__
i don't want to go back to the dai when women didn't have control of their health care choic __PUNCT__
i got two daughter __PUNCT__ and i want them to have the same control over their health care as anybodi son out there __PUNCT__
i believ that the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and we don't need anoth __NUM__ year of argument about health care __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
the afford health care act __PUNCT__ otherwis known as obamacar __PUNCT__ wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ thei right __PUNCT__ i do care __PUNCT__
i care about folk who get sick and go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i care about parent who don't know whether or not thei go to be abl to get treatment for their kid __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and for all the misinform out there __PUNCT__ it veri simpl to describ what go to happen __PUNCT__
if you alreadi have health care __PUNCT__ the onli thing that you have to do is enjoi the fact that now insur compani can't jerk you around becaus of the small print __PUNCT__
you have right __PUNCT__
your kid can stai on your parent __PUNCT__ their parent plan until thei __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
senior citizen ar see reduct in prescript drug cost __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ we go to help you get it __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ it true we expect everybodi to act respons __PUNCT__ so for the __NUM__ percent or __NUM__ percent of peopl who still don't get health insur even though thei can afford it __PUNCT__ we go to sai to them __PUNCT__ you can't pass off those cost on to somebodi els in the form of higher premium __PUNCT__
you got to take respons as well __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we ar not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ million peopl ar go to get health insur becaus of it __PUNCT__
we not go backward when it come to immigr __PUNCT__
my oppon sai the arizona law could be __PUNCT__ a model for the nation __PUNCT__
audienc member boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i believ we ar a nation of law and a nation of immigr __PUNCT__
i believ we can secur our border and give opportun to peopl who ar strive and work hard __PUNCT__ especi young peopl who have been rais in thi countri and see themselv as american __PUNCT__
that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
and we go to get control of our deficit and debt __PUNCT__ but not with the plan that these folk ar promot __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei sai thi is the most import issu __PUNCT__ the thing thei care about most __PUNCT__
and then thei propos a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that would mostli benefit folk who don't need it and would blow a hole a mile wide through our budget __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't believ govern can solv everi problem __PUNCT__
not everi govern program work __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar out of our feder budget __PUNCT__ and we can do more __PUNCT__
but we got to do it smartli and respons __PUNCT__
i don't believ that govern can help somebodi that doesn't want to help themselv __PUNCT__ but for all those folk who ar work hard everi dai __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that we continu to invest so that young peopl can go to colleg __PUNCT__ that we continu to take step so that we got a great transport system to move peopl and good and servic across the countri __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that we invest in basic research and scienc that ha given us thi technolog lead that allow us to grow and becom the econom superpow that we ar __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we make some more cut __PUNCT__ but let ask folk who have been incred bless to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__ to go back to the rate we had under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ that theori ha been test as well __PUNCT__ becaus when bill clinton did it __PUNCT__ we had surplus instead of deficit __PUNCT__
we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and peopl at the top did realli well also __PUNCT__
like i said __PUNCT__ that been our histori __PUNCT__ when middl class folk ar do well and those strive to get into the middl class ar do well __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
and that mayb is what is at the heart of the differ in thi debat __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i believ in individu initi and entrepreneurship and risk __PUNCT__ take __PUNCT__
and i believ that the free market is the greatest system on earth to creat wealth and prosper __PUNCT__
but just like abraham lincoln said __PUNCT__ there ar some thing we do better togeth than we do on our own __PUNCT__
when my grandfath came back home and that gener got the gi bill that wa great for everyon becaus it upgrad the skill of all of our worker __PUNCT__ that wasn't just good for some __PUNCT__ that wa good for all __PUNCT__
when we invest in the hoover dam or the golden gate bridg or the transcontinent rail system __PUNCT__ or when we sent a man to the moon or invent the internet __PUNCT__ that wa good for everybodi __PUNCT__
there ar some thing we do better togeth __PUNCT__
and we rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that what our histori tell us __PUNCT__
that what our futur demand __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so let me just sai thi __PUNCT__
in the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you gui won't see them becaus you not consid on of the battleground state __PUNCT__ although that go to be chang soon __PUNCT__
but there go to be more monei spent than we ever seen befor __PUNCT__
folk write __MONEY__ million check to try to beat me __PUNCT__ run ad with scari voic __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and basic __PUNCT__ on messag __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ it a veri simpl messag __PUNCT__
their messag is the economi is not where it need to be and it obama fault __PUNCT__
so there will be variou __PUNCT__ there will be variat on the theme __PUNCT__ but it will be the same messag over and over and over again __PUNCT__
that what thei bank on __PUNCT__ becaus thei can't sell their actual econom plan __PUNCT__ so their goal is to see if thei can knock us down __PUNCT__
more monei than we ever seen befor __PUNCT__
and it understand that some folk get cynic about the polit process as a result __PUNCT__
but what you taught me in __NUM__ it the same thing that i learn in my first campaign __PUNCT__ as i wa travel around in my car __PUNCT__ go from town to town __PUNCT__ talk to peopl in their live room or vfw hall or diner __PUNCT__ and try to get their vote and hear stori about peopl parent and grandpar and great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ some who came as immigr __PUNCT__ some who were brought here not of their own accord __PUNCT__ some who work in mill or mine __PUNCT__ some who work on farm __PUNCT__ ranch __PUNCT__
the thing i learn wa that there is a core decenc and grit and faith in the american peopl __PUNCT__
and when the american peopl decid what true and what right and thei join togeth to bring about chang __PUNCT__ to make thi countri more respons to the hope and dream of ordinari peopl __PUNCT__ when that happen __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter how much monei the other side spend __PUNCT__ it can't be stop __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ it cannot be stop __PUNCT__
you show that in __NUM__ and i believ you go to show it again in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i tri to make promis in __NUM__ that i knew i could keep __PUNCT__ and on of those promis wa that i wasn't a perfect man and i wouldn't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__ but i alwai tell you what i thought and i alwai tell you where i stood __PUNCT__ and i spend everi wake minut fight as hard as i knew how for you __PUNCT__ make sure that everi singl dai i wa think about how to make your live a littl bit better __PUNCT__
and i knew i could keep that promis becaus i saw myself in you __PUNCT__
and when i saw your grandpar __PUNCT__ i saw my grandpar __PUNCT__
and when i saw your kid __PUNCT__ i saw my kid __PUNCT__
and i kept that promis __PUNCT__
and i still believ in you __PUNCT__
and if you still believ in me and you will to stand up and knock on door and make phone call and get out there and fight on behalf of a vision in which everi american ha opportun to pursu their dream __PUNCT__ i promis you __PUNCT__ we will finish what we start in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we will not be go backward __PUNCT__ we will be go forward __PUNCT__
we will win thi elect __PUNCT__
and we will remind the world just why it is that the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__ god bless the great state of texa __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
