doe that sound familiar __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that what thei said __PUNCT__

audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we need to keep on go becaus we got more chang to bring about __PUNCT__
so let me paint that vision of chang for you __PUNCT__
chang is a countri where everi american ha a shot at a good educ __PUNCT__
don't tell me hire more teacher won't help thi economi grow __PUNCT__
don't tell me that student who can't afford colleg should just borrow monei from their parent __PUNCT__
that wasn't an option for me __PUNCT__ i bet it not an option for a lot of you __PUNCT__
that why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i want to recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher so our kid don't fall behind the rest of the world __PUNCT__
i want to train __NUM__ million american at our commun colleg with the skill that busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
that what we fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what real chang is __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
chang come when we live up to thi countri legaci of innov __PUNCT__
i veri proud i bet on american worker and american ingenu and the american auto industri __PUNCT__
but what i especi proud of is __PUNCT__ we not just build car again __PUNCT__ we build better car __PUNCT__ car that by the middl of the next decad will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
but it doesn't stop at auto __PUNCT__
we innov everywher __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar thousand of worker build long __PUNCT__ last batteri and wind turbin and work to figur out new sourc of fuel all across the countri __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure we not have a tax code that subsid oil compani profit when thei alreadi make a lot of monei __PUNCT__
i want to support the new sourc of energi __PUNCT__ the job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ the technolog that will cut our oil import in half and help our nation secur and help our environ __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that reward compani for ship job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to reward compani that ar invest right here in milwauke __PUNCT__ invest in wisconsin __PUNCT__ invest in the next gener of manufactur __PUNCT__
that the futur i see for our countri __PUNCT__ and i know it there __PUNCT__
it readi __PUNCT__ within our grasp __PUNCT__
chang is turn the page on a decad of war so we can do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
but it time to us some of the save from end the iraq war __PUNCT__ wind down the afghan war __PUNCT__ to pai down our debt and rebuild america __PUNCT__
let put some folk to work right now rebuild road __PUNCT__ bridg __PUNCT__ make sure our school ar state of the art __PUNCT__
let lai broadband line into our rural commun __PUNCT__
and let us our veteran __PUNCT__ let make sure thei got job __PUNCT__ becaus when you fought for our freedom __PUNCT__ you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home __PUNCT__
that my plan to keep us strong __PUNCT__
that my commit __PUNCT__
and that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ chang is a futur where we reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but we do it in a balanc wai __PUNCT__
i sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of cut __PUNCT__ i am prepar to do more __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about the deficit __PUNCT__ we also got to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the tax rate thei paid when bill clinton wa in offic __PUNCT__
becaus budget ar about choic __PUNCT__ and if you go to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ someth ha got to give __PUNCT__
and as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i not go to turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__ make our senior more vulner __PUNCT__ just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to ask young peopl to pai more for colleg so i get a tax cut __PUNCT__
so we know what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ we know it won't be easi __PUNCT__
the next phase of chang will not be easi __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ i know a lot of folk __PUNCT__ thei were swept up in the excit and had the poster and __PUNCT__ but sometim mayb peopl didn't hear me when i said chang we believ in is no just chang presid __PUNCT__ it not just chang parti __PUNCT__
it chang our polit __PUNCT__
it chang the system __PUNCT__
i ran becaus the voic of the american peopl __PUNCT__ your voic __PUNCT__ had been shut out of our democraci for wai too long __PUNCT__ by lobbyist and special interest __PUNCT__ politician who were will to do whatev it take __PUNCT__ sai whatev it take just to keep thing the wai thei ar __PUNCT__ the protector of the statu quo __PUNCT__
over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ those protector of the statu quo in washington __PUNCT__ thei have fought us everi step of the wai __PUNCT__ spent million of dollar to stop us from reform the health care system __PUNCT__ spent million try to stop us from reform wall street __PUNCT__
thei engin a strategi of gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that democrat and republican us to agre to in the past __PUNCT__
and the reason thei did it is becaus thei count on you to be so worn down by all the squabbl __PUNCT__ so tire of all the dysfunct __PUNCT__ that you just give up __PUNCT__ you walk awai __PUNCT__ you leav them in power __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ their bet is on cynic __PUNCT__
thei figur thei can outlast you __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei figur __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ these gui mai get enthusiast __PUNCT__ but over time __PUNCT__ that enthusiasm fade awai __PUNCT__ and we still here __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ my bet is on you __PUNCT__
my bet is on the good and decenc of the american peopl __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the point i make here is not partisan __PUNCT__
when the other parti ha been with me to fight for middl class famili __PUNCT__ i love work with them __PUNCT__
when we cut tax for middl class famili and small busi __PUNCT__ that wa bipartisan __PUNCT__
when we repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ there were some courag republican in the senat who vote with us __PUNCT__
that wa leadership __PUNCT__
i will work with anybodi of ani parti to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and if you realli want to break the gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ you vote for leader who feel the same wai __PUNCT__ whether thei democrat __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ peopl who put you first __PUNCT__ who put the american peopl first __PUNCT__ not the elect first or partisan advantag first or special interest first or big __PUNCT__ monei contributor first or super pac first __PUNCT__ but put the peopl of wisconsin first __PUNCT__
that what you should be think about __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ there ar go to be some fight sometim __PUNCT__ becaus there ar fight that need to be had to bring about chang and push through the resist of the statu quo __PUNCT__
if the price of peac in washington is cut deal that will kick student off of financi aid or get rid of fund for plan parenthood or let insur compani go back to discrimin against peopl with preexist condit or elimin health care for million on medicaid who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__ that not a deal i will to take __PUNCT__
that not a price you should want your presid to pai __PUNCT__
that not bipartisanship __PUNCT__
that not chang __PUNCT__
that surrend to a statu quo that doesn't work for middl class famili __PUNCT__
and i not readi to give up on the fight __PUNCT__ i not readi to give up on the fight __PUNCT__
and i hope you aren't either __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__
