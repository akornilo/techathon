thi is a choic not just between two candid __PUNCT__
it not just between two polit parti __PUNCT__
more than ani elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic about two fundament differ vision for our countri __PUNCT__ how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth will have an impact not just on your live __PUNCT__ but on the live of your children and the live of your grandchildren __PUNCT__
it will impact us for decad to come __PUNCT__
when we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ we had independ and some republican too __PUNCT__ it wa to restor the basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__ the basic bargain that made us the most prosper economi in the world __PUNCT__
it a bargain that sai if we work hard __PUNCT__ we should be reward __PUNCT__
it a deal that sai if you put in enough effort __PUNCT__ you can find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you can afford a home that you call your own __PUNCT__
you won't go broke when you get sick __PUNCT__
you can retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ it a bargain that sai your kid will get a great educ and thei grow up safe and healthi __PUNCT__
and thei will have opportun that you couldn't even dream of __PUNCT__ that thei will be abl to achiev thing that you could have onli hope for __PUNCT__
that the basic promis of america __PUNCT__
that the american dream __PUNCT__
and we knew that restor it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__ that it would take more than on year __PUNCT__ or on term __PUNCT__ or even on presid __PUNCT__ becaus we had just gone through a decad in which the middl class had been take a lot of hit __PUNCT__
job had been get ship oversea __PUNCT__
incom and wage were flat or even go down __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__
a few folk at the top were do realli well __PUNCT__ but the averag famili wa struggl __PUNCT__
and thi wa befor we saw the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and so mani more of our friend and neighbor and famili member lost their job and lost their home __PUNCT__ lost their save and push that american dream even further out of reach __PUNCT__
so when i ran for thi offic __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i told you there were no quick fix __PUNCT__ there were no easi solut __PUNCT__
that still true todai __PUNCT__
but what i also told you and what is also still true todai is that we have the capac to meet everi challeng __PUNCT__
we got everyth we need to meet our challeng __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we still got the best entrepreneur __PUNCT__ and small businessmen and women in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best farmer in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
we ar still a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__ peopl want to come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay sai __PUNCT__ no matter how dark the other side tri to paint thing __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't gladli chang place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
becaus peopl understand that even though we go through some tough time __PUNCT__ there is a resili and grit about thi countri __PUNCT__
and thi countri is the place where if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
that the idea that we were try to rebuild in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that the idea that we continu to pursu in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that is what thi campaign is all about __PUNCT__
and that is why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__

he is a articul spokesman for governor romnei vision __PUNCT__
i just happen to fundament disagre with hi vision __PUNCT__
their vision is wrong for work famili __PUNCT__ and it is wrong for the countri __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ my oppon and hi friend in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ that if you just get rid of more regul on big corpor and big bank and then you give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ that that will automat lead to job and prosper for ordinari famili __PUNCT__
and i not exagger here __PUNCT__ that their basic econom plan __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of governor romnei econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion is a lot of monei __PUNCT__ even in washington __PUNCT__
our entir defens budget is a littl over half a trillion dollar a year __PUNCT__ so thi tax cut would be like give the equival of the entir defens budget in tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to veri rich peopl __PUNCT__ everi year for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ these folk sai thei want to reduc the deficit and the debt __PUNCT__
so the question is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how do you give awai __MONEY__ trillion and then reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ recent __PUNCT__ we found out __PUNCT__
governor romnei expect you to pai for it __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__

governor romnei tax plan would actual rais tax on middl class famili by an averag of __MONEY__ for famili with children __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
i don't have __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you don't have __MONEY__ to spare __PUNCT__
i didn't think so __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ don't take my word for it __PUNCT__
thi is base on independ studi that have been done by folk who analyz thi stuff for a live __PUNCT__
thei sai __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ thi will cost middl class famili with children an averag of __MONEY__
and thei ask you to pai an extra __NUM__ buck not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ not to help our kid get educ __PUNCT__ not to help kid go to colleg __PUNCT__ not to rebuild our road or our bridg or our port __PUNCT__ thei do thi to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to folk who ar make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ have you heard thi befor __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei have been try to sell thi trickl __PUNCT__ down snake oil befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ it didn't work then __PUNCT__
it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move the economi forward __PUNCT__
and secretli __PUNCT__ i think thei know thi __PUNCT__
i think thei know their plan is not veri popular __PUNCT__
you can tell that becaus thei be pretti dishonest about my plan __PUNCT__ especi __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ when it come to medicar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is someth i got to point out here __PUNCT__ becaus thei ar just throw everyth at the wall to see if it stick __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ here what you need to know __PUNCT__ i have strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
i have made reform that have save million of senior with medicar hundr of dollar on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
i have propos reform that will save medicar monei by get rid of wast spend in the health care system __PUNCT__ reform that will not touch your medicar benefit __PUNCT__ not by a dime __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei and hi run mate have a veri differ plan __PUNCT__
thei want to turn medicar into a voucher program __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that mean senior would no longer have the guarante of medicar __PUNCT__ thei get a voucher to bui privat insur __PUNCT__
and becaus the voucher wouldn't keep up with cost __PUNCT__ the plan author by governor romnei run mate __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ would forc senior to pai an extra __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and i assum thei don't have it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
my plan ha alreadi extend medicar by nearli a decad __PUNCT__
their plan end medicar as we know it __PUNCT__
my plan reduc the cost of medicar by crack down on fraud and wast and subsidi to insur compani __PUNCT__
their plan make senior pai more so thei can give anoth tax cut to millionair and billionair __PUNCT__
that the differ between our plan on medicar __PUNCT__
that an exampl of the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that is why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
just like we got a differ plan on medicar __PUNCT__ we got a differ econom plan __PUNCT__
you just heard __PUNCT__ thei want to give __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ tax break to wealthi american who don't need them __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ dubuqu __PUNCT__ that exactli what i done __PUNCT__
so if you talk to a friend of your who sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ those democrat __PUNCT__ thei all tax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ spend liber __PUNCT__ you tell them the averag middl class famili __PUNCT__ their tax ar about __MONEY__ lower sinc i becom presid __PUNCT__
and right now what i want to do is to keep tax right where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of american famili do and __NUM__ percent of small busi do __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
i wish __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still get a tax cut on your first __MONEY__
but all we ask is __PUNCT__ if for the next littl bit that you make you can afford to contribut a littl bit more __PUNCT__ abov __MONEY__ so that we can pai down our deficit in a respons __PUNCT__ balanc wai and invest in thing like educ that help america grow __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that alon won't cut our deficit __PUNCT__
we go to have to still make sure govern doe it part __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend that we don't need __PUNCT__ and we can do more to make govern more effici __PUNCT__
we have to do more __PUNCT__
but we not go to reduc the deficit just on the back of the middl class __PUNCT__
so i think it make sens to ask folk like me who been incred bless to go back to the rate that we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ a time __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ when nearli __NUM__ million new job were creat __PUNCT__ we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ here the kicker __PUNCT__ we creat a lot of millionair too __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the reason is __PUNCT__ is becaus the economi __PUNCT__ when you look back on american histori __PUNCT__ alwai work best when the middl class is do well __PUNCT__
let me ask you someth __PUNCT__
when a teacher or a construct worker or a receptionist or a firefight __PUNCT__ when you get a littl extra monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you spend it __PUNCT__
becaus time ar tight and mayb you been drive around in that old beater __PUNCT__ you had that car for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and you decid it about time to trade it in __PUNCT__
or mayb you think now is the time i can final bui a new comput for my kid who is about to go off to colleg __PUNCT__
or mayb i go to a restaur __PUNCT__ or heaven forbid __PUNCT__ i take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and what happen is that suddenli busi have more custom __PUNCT__ and thei make more profit __PUNCT__
and so folk at the top ar do veri well __PUNCT__ but the busi __PUNCT__ becaus thei more profit __PUNCT__ now thei hire more worker __PUNCT__ who then have more monei __PUNCT__ who then bui more product __PUNCT__ who then give busi more custom __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ give everybodi a fair shot __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__ becaus that what i believ __PUNCT__
that my vision for the futur __PUNCT__
on just about everi issu __PUNCT__ governor romnei and i just have a differ opinion __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ more than a million job at stake __PUNCT__ governor romnei said let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and we got worker and manag togeth __PUNCT__ and thei chang how thei were do busi __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri is back on top __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that the kind of america we need __PUNCT__
so now i want american manufactur back in america __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give those tax break to compani that ar invest right here in dubuqu __PUNCT__ right here in the quad __PUNCT__ right here in iowa __PUNCT__ in cleveland and raleigh __PUNCT__
let put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
governor romnei like to sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ i know how to fix the economi __PUNCT__ becaus i been in the privat sector __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ it turn out that a lot of that experi wa invest in compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ in outsourc __PUNCT__
we don't need folk who know how to outsourc __PUNCT__
we need folk who ar work to insourc __PUNCT__ to creat job here __PUNCT__ and hire american worker so we sell american product around the world stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
on energi __PUNCT__ governor romnei ha said that he want to get rid of the tax credit for wind energi __PUNCT__ doesn't believ in it __PUNCT__ he sai these sourc of energi ar __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
congressman ryan call them a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
he need to come to iowa __PUNCT__
he find out that there ar __NUM__ job in thi state that depend on the wind industri __PUNCT__
these job aren't a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
thei the futur __PUNCT__
we should stop give __MONEY__ billion of taxpay subsidi to oil compani that ar make monei everi time you go to the pump __PUNCT__
let start invest in clean energi that will creat job and secur our futur __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that our kid ar get the best educ in the world __PUNCT__
i wa just visit some teacher befor __PUNCT__ cascad middl school __PUNCT__ right befor i came here __PUNCT__
aren't you suppos to be at the in servic over there __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i won't tell __PUNCT__
just don't get photograph __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and we had thi great meet __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ and folk don't go into teach for the monei __PUNCT__
thei go into it becaus thei believ in our kid __PUNCT__ thei believ in our futur __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ but school district all across iowa and all across the countri ar have a tough time __PUNCT__ budget cut __PUNCT__ teacher layoff __PUNCT__
so i said let help local school district to make sure thei can hire great teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__ where we got to realli do better in term of our perform __PUNCT__
