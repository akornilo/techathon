i don't believ we ar go to get veri far if we got leader who write off half the nation as a bunch of victim who don't take respons for their own live __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ i have spent a lot of time in ohio __PUNCT__ and i don't meet a lot of victim __PUNCT__

we believ in a countri where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ where respons is reward __PUNCT__ where everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
we believ in an america where no matter who you ar or what you look like or where you come from or who you love __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i said thi befor __PUNCT__ and i will sai it again __PUNCT__ the path i offer is not quick or easi __PUNCT__
the truth is __PUNCT__ we had problem that have been build up for decad __PUNCT__ job be ship oversea __PUNCT__ paycheck shrink even when the cost of everyth is go up __PUNCT__
so for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we been work to start restor that basic bargain that sai __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
but we got a lot more to do __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
i love you __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__ but let me __PUNCT__ but i want especi the young peopl to understand __PUNCT__ you should feel confid about our futur becaus our problem can be solv __PUNCT__ our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
we still got the world best worker __PUNCT__ the best busi __PUNCT__ the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best research __PUNCT__ the best colleg and univers __PUNCT__
so there not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state __PUNCT__
but we got more work to do __PUNCT__
and the path i offer __PUNCT__ even though it harder __PUNCT__ it go to lead to a better place __PUNCT__
and in case some of you miss the convent or onli watch michel and didn't watch me __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ which i understand __PUNCT__ let me repeat the plan that i put forward __PUNCT__ practic __PUNCT__ specif __PUNCT__ five __PUNCT__ point plan to grow our middl class __PUNCT__ creat strong job here in ohio and around the countri __PUNCT__ and lai a stronger foundat for our economi __PUNCT__
first thing is i want to see us export more job __PUNCT__ export more product __PUNCT__ excus me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i wa channel my oppon there for a second __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i want to see us export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ sever year ago __PUNCT__ said let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
and when he said that __PUNCT__ he wa talk about on in eight ohio job __PUNCT__ busi in __NUM__ out of __NUM__ ohio counti that count on the auto industri __PUNCT__
and so we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thi mai be hard and it mai not be popular __PUNCT__ but we go to bet on american worker __PUNCT__
we go to bet on american manufactur __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__ with nearli __NUM__ new job __PUNCT__
and so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can give more tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
or we can reward compani that ar open new plant here in ohio __PUNCT__ train new worker in __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ creat new job here in america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
i believ in you __PUNCT__ barack __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus we been work on it __PUNCT__ you believ me __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we don't just talk the talk __PUNCT__
my oppon been spend a lot of time in ohio late __PUNCT__ and he been talk tough about china __PUNCT__
he sai he go to take the fight right to them __PUNCT__
he go to go after the cheater __PUNCT__ he sai __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to admit that the messag he deliv now is better than the on that he wa deliv all those year he wa profit from invest in compani that were ship job to china __PUNCT__
when you hear hi newfound outrag __PUNCT__ when you see those ad he run promis to get tough on china __PUNCT__ it sort of like the fox stand up and sai __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ we need to keep the chicken coop more secur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it just not veri credibl __PUNCT__ becaus that not where he been __PUNCT__ except dure elect season __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ you can look at what we done __PUNCT__
ever singl dai __PUNCT__ i wake up think about how we strengthen the posit of american worker __PUNCT__ make sure thei get a fair shot in the global economi __PUNCT__
so we brought more trade case against china in on term than the previou administr did in two __PUNCT__ and we been win __PUNCT__
when governor romnei said stop an unfair surg in chines tire would be bad for our worker and bad for america __PUNCT__ we said __PUNCT__ we go to do it anywai __PUNCT__
we didn't take hi advic __PUNCT__
and we got over __NUM__ american back to work __PUNCT__
so you can look at what i done __PUNCT__ and you can look at what he done __PUNCT__ and you have a sens of who go to be fight for american worker __PUNCT__
and you can look at hi plan __PUNCT__ and you can look at my plan __PUNCT__ becaus he want to keep open these tax loophol that encourag job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that we provid tax break for compani right here in america __PUNCT__
i want to help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
i want more good stamp with __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
i want to creat __NUM__ million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
second part of the plan is to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of not do anyth __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so by the next decad __PUNCT__ middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__ and it will help the environ __PUNCT__ and it will help the economi __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi that we gener from wind and solar __PUNCT__
we got thousand of american __PUNCT__ includ folk right here in ohio __PUNCT__ who work todai build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ america is less depend on foreign oil than in nearli __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to revers that progress __PUNCT__ get rid of tax credit for thing like wind energi __PUNCT__
i got a differ view __PUNCT__
unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan __PUNCT__
and i sure not go to let them continu to collect __MONEY__ billion everi singl year in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
thei don't need it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ thei don't need it __PUNCT__
thei make monei everi time you go to the pump __PUNCT__
so let take that __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ and let invest it in wind and solar __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
let help farmer and scientist har the power of biofuel __PUNCT__
let put construct worker back to work retrofit our build and our home so thei wast less energi __PUNCT__
let go after a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
we can creat hundr of thousand of new job and improv our economi __PUNCT__ and we can cut in half our oil import by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that the goal that i am set __PUNCT__
that is what we fight for __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that everybodi in america get a great educ __PUNCT__ everybodi __PUNCT__
educ wa the gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__
it wa the onli reason i stand here __PUNCT__
i wasn't born to wealth or fame __PUNCT__ but i got a great educ __PUNCT__
same thing for michel __PUNCT__ same thing for a lot of you __PUNCT__
it the gatewai to the middl class __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ we don't just talk the talk __PUNCT__ we walk the walk __PUNCT__
we took on a system that wa send billion of dollar to bank and lender in the student loan system __PUNCT__ we said why do we need middlemen __PUNCT__ let give the loan directli to student __PUNCT__
we can help keep interest rate low __PUNCT__
we can provid more pell grant __PUNCT__
that what we been fight for __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ you got a choic __PUNCT__ becaus governor romnei want to roll back all that stuff we did __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ a shame __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
it is a shame __PUNCT__
so we can gut educ to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__ or we can decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of a overcrowd classroom __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no busi should have to look for worker in china becaus thei can't find on with the right skill here in the unit state __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ i am ask you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__
help me improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
help me give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn the skill thei need at commun colleg that will lead directli to a new job __PUNCT__
help us work with colleg and univers to cut the cost of tuition __PUNCT__
help us meet those goal __PUNCT__
help us choos that futur for america __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ let reduc the deficit in a wai that doesn't stick it to middl class famili __PUNCT__
i alreadi work with republican in congress to cut __MONEY__ trillion in spend __PUNCT__ and i will to do more __PUNCT__
i put forward a plan for a __MONEY__ trillion deficit reduct __PUNCT__ but to do that __PUNCT__ we can't just cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
we got to reform our tax code so that it simpl and it fair __PUNCT__ and ask the wealthiest household to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ to go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ when we creat nearli __NUM__ million new job and the biggest surplu in histori and a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in fair __PUNCT__ my oppon ha a plan too __PUNCT__ when it come to tax __PUNCT__
but as presid clinton said __PUNCT__ it doesn't have ani arithmet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei try to sell the idea that you can somehow lower our deficit by spend trillion of dollar more on tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
and no matter how mani time thei try to __PUNCT__ reboot __PUNCT__ their campaign __PUNCT__ no matter how mani time thei try to tell you thei go to start talk specif realli soon __PUNCT__ thei don't do it __PUNCT__
and the reason is becaus the math doesn't work __PUNCT__
thei do not __PUNCT__ thei cannot explain sai how __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut ar go to be put on the tabl without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ thei don't stop there __PUNCT__
thei want to spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion in new militari spend that our militari hasn't ask for __PUNCT__
so the reason thei don't explain it is becaus thei can't __PUNCT__
the math doe not add up __PUNCT__
so if thei go around __PUNCT__ as thei have in ohio __PUNCT__ with some board behind them with the number and sai how it a moral oblig to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ just ask them __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ explain to us how the number work __PUNCT__
becaus thei don't __PUNCT__
thei don't have a deficit reduct plan __PUNCT__
thei have a deficit expans plan __PUNCT__
my __PUNCT__ governor romnei mai think it fair that somebodi who make __MONEY__ million a year like he doe should pai a lower tax rate than a teacher or an autowork who make __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
i don't think that fair __PUNCT__
i don't think it help the economi grow __PUNCT__
we cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__ and we want to keep tax low for __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__
and the reason is __PUNCT__ when middl class famili have a littl monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ becaus you got a lot of need __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ so you mai end up trade in that __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old car __PUNCT__ bui a new on __PUNCT__
mayb you bui a new comput for your kid who is go off to colleg __PUNCT__
and what happen when you spend monei __PUNCT__ that mean busi have more custom __PUNCT__ thei make more profit __PUNCT__ thei then hire more worker __PUNCT__ the economi grow __PUNCT__
that what we did in the __PUNCT__ 90 __PUNCT__
that what we can do todai __PUNCT__
that the wai forward __PUNCT__
so i look forward to work with republican to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
we not go to do that __PUNCT__
i refus to ask all the student here to pai more for colleg or to kick children off of head start program so i can take a tax break that we don't need __PUNCT__
we not go to kick the poor and the elderli and the disabl out of health care to pai for a tax cut like that that doesn't help us grow __PUNCT__
and i will not turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__
i will not do that __PUNCT__
after a lifetim of labor __PUNCT__ no american should have their golden year __PUNCT__ their retir year __PUNCT__ spent at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ thei earn it __PUNCT__
so we go to __PUNCT__ we reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we do it the right wai __PUNCT__ by actual reduc cost __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
same thing with social secur __PUNCT__ we take respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ but we not go to turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ we been talk a lot about what happen here at home __PUNCT__ but that connect to what happen abroad __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i said that we wind down the war in afghanistan in a respons wai __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
becaus of the incred servic and sacrific of our troop __PUNCT__ a new tower is rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
but we still face seriou threat in the world __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ so long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ we ar go to maintain the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop come home and thei take off that uniform __PUNCT__ we go to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus thei shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
we deserv __PUNCT__ thei deserv our honor and our respect __PUNCT__ and we got to do what we need to do to make sure thei have opportun in thi countri __PUNCT__
but even on foreign polici __PUNCT__ my oppon ha a differ view __PUNCT__
he said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ the wai i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
he still hasn't explain how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and what i also said is i go to us some of the monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school and runwai __PUNCT__ becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
that what we go to start fight for __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ kent state __PUNCT__ that the choic we now face __PUNCT__
that what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ thei like to tell you __PUNCT__ and thei go to spend a whole lot of monei __PUNCT__ thei get these __MONEY__ million check from these peopl who can afford to write __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
and thei go to run ad after ad __PUNCT__ tell you that bigger tax cut __PUNCT__ fewer regul __PUNCT__ that the onli wai to go __PUNCT__
thei go to tell you that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their basic theori is if you can't afford health care __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ if some compani is pollut the air your children ar breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what we about __PUNCT__
govern can't solv everi problem __PUNCT__ but it not the sourc of all our problem either __PUNCT__
just like __PUNCT__ we have thi kind of polit where we pretend that somebodi out there is to blame __PUNCT__ welfar recipi or corpor or union or immigr or gai __PUNCT__
that not how thi countri work __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we believ that america onli work where we accept respons for ourselv __PUNCT__ but we accept respons for the countri and for each other __PUNCT__
that how we creat opportun __PUNCT__
that how we creat possibl __PUNCT__
we understand america is not about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ but what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
and we got proof that thi work __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i said thi isn't about me __PUNCT__ i said it wa about you __PUNCT__

you the reason some student in akron or columbu or at kent state can pai for a colleg educ or some veteran can go to colleg on the new gi bill __PUNCT__
you the reason some young immigr who wa brought here as a kid and ha been rais here and pledg allegi to our flag is not suddenli go to be deport to a countri she never known __PUNCT__
you the reason why some outstand soldier won't be kick out of the militari becaus of who thei ar or who thei love __PUNCT__
