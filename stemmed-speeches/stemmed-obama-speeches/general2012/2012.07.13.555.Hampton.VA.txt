in a lot of wai __PUNCT__ the stake ar bigger than thei were back in __NUM__ becaus we face a choic between two veri differ vision for thi countri __PUNCT__
and the choic between these two path for our countri ultim is go to be up to you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we love michel __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ i know you all love michel __PUNCT__
i know that __PUNCT__
but sinc thi is my last campaign __PUNCT__ it got me a littl nostalg about my first campaign __PUNCT__
i think about the place i us to travel in illinoi __PUNCT__ vfw hall and diner __PUNCT__ and we go to small town __PUNCT__ and we go to big citi __PUNCT__
and you meet folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ straight __PUNCT__ disabl __PUNCT__ not __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__
and everywher i went __PUNCT__ what wa interest wa that for all the differ __PUNCT__ there wa someth everybodi had in common __PUNCT__ and in peopl live i see my own life __PUNCT__
i meet an older vet __PUNCT__ and i think about my grandfath and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ part of that world war ii gener __PUNCT__ my grandfath fight in world war ii __PUNCT__ then come home __PUNCT__ and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who had been work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__ thei were abl to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and how thei were abl to bui their first home with an fha mortgag __PUNCT__
and i thought about my mom __PUNCT__ becaus if i see a singl mom __PUNCT__ i think about how challeng it wa for her to rais me without a dad and rais my sister without a dad __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ how she wa abl to put herself through school and work at the same time and give her child the best educ thi countri had to offer __PUNCT__
and i think about michel famili __PUNCT__
i meet a famili __PUNCT__ and it didn't matter whether it wa some rural area or small town __PUNCT__ you meet folk who remind me of michel dad __PUNCT__ who had multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ could bare walk by the time i met him __PUNCT__ but never miss a dai of work __PUNCT__ work a blue __PUNCT__ collar job __PUNCT__
and michel mom stai at home until the kid got old enough and then becam a secretari at a bank __PUNCT__ and she work as a secretari all her life __PUNCT__
and thei never had a lot __PUNCT__
but thei had a lot of love __PUNCT__
and thei had strong valu __PUNCT__
and thei had disciplin __PUNCT__
and that why michel and her brother could go on and achiev thing that their parent couldn't even imagin __PUNCT__
and what i realiz dure that first campaign and all the campaign after that wa that our live all were a testament to that fundament american idea __PUNCT__ the idea that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
thi countri ha never been full of folk look for handout __PUNCT__
we a nation of worker and doer and dreamer __PUNCT__
we work hard for what we get __PUNCT__
and all we ask for is that our hard work pai off __PUNCT__ that our respons is reward __PUNCT__ that if we will to put in the effort __PUNCT__ we can find a job that support a famili and be abl to get a home we can call our own __PUNCT__ we won't go bankrupt when we get sick __PUNCT__ take a littl vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__ send our kid to colleg and let them do thing so much bigger than what we did __PUNCT__ and then retir with some digniti and some respect __PUNCT__ and be part of a commun and a neighborhood and a nation that look after it own __PUNCT__
that basic bargain is what built the biggest middl class we ever seen __PUNCT__
that basic bargain is what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__
that basic bargain is what made us the envi of the world __PUNCT__
and in __NUM__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ we had independ __PUNCT__ we had republican __PUNCT__ all who recogn that that basic bargain wa start to frai __PUNCT__ that it wa get weaker __PUNCT__
we gone through a decad that had seen wage and incom not go up __PUNCT__ job growth sluggish __PUNCT__ surplus turn into deficit __PUNCT__
that middl class dream seem like it wa slip awai for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
and then just as the campaign wa be complet and just as we were make some histori __PUNCT__ what we realiz wa we go through the worst financi crisi and econom crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
we knew that turn thi thing around would not be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it wa go to take more than __NUM__ year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__
and thi crisi ha been tough on a lot of folk and a lot of famili __PUNCT__
it rob million of hard __PUNCT__ work american their livelihood __PUNCT__ their home __PUNCT__ their save __PUNCT__
it push the american dream __PUNCT__ that basic bargain __PUNCT__ even further out of reach for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ that crisi didn't chang who we ar or what we believ in __PUNCT__
it didn't chang our charact as a countri __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang why we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
our mission right now is to put peopl back to work and recov from thi recess __PUNCT__
but it more than that __PUNCT__
it is also about how we restor that basic bargain that everi american believ in __PUNCT__ that if you work hard you can get ahead __PUNCT__
our goal is an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ an economi where everybodi __PUNCT__ whether you start a busi or you punch a clock __PUNCT__ everybodi can have confid that thei can make it __PUNCT__
that what the campaign in __NUM__ wa about __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__
that is the reason i am run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just sai thi __PUNCT__
for all the work that we done __PUNCT__ as tim kain talk about __PUNCT__ creat more than 4½ million job __PUNCT__ make sure that we bring manufactur back to our shore __PUNCT__ restor our auto industri so it number on again __PUNCT__ get health care pass __PUNCT__ for all the work that we done __PUNCT__ we got a lot more work to do __PUNCT__
and what hold us back from meet these big challeng is not the lack of technic solut __PUNCT__ it not the lack of big idea __PUNCT__
the problem is we got a stalem in thi countri __PUNCT__ at least we got a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
actual __PUNCT__ when you talk to ordinari peopl __PUNCT__ thei see common sens __PUNCT__ but appar it harder to recogn in washington __PUNCT__
so we got a choic __PUNCT__
the outcom will determin not just how thing go a year from now or __NUM__ year from now or __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__ but mayb __NUM__ or __NUM__ or __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ that prosper come from the top down __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ thi is what democraci is about __PUNCT__
we go to have a debat about how to grow thi economi and help build a strong middl class __PUNCT__
and thei believ that happen from the top down __PUNCT__
thei believ that if we spend trillion of dollar more on tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__ if we elimin regul that protect consum __PUNCT__ make sure insur compani can't take advantag of you __PUNCT__ that we elimin regul that protect our air and our water and make sure our children ar healthi __PUNCT__ if we do those thing __PUNCT__ then somehow even if we have to pai for it by gut educ or mayb rais tax on middl class famili or elimin train program __PUNCT__ that somehow we go to be better off __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that their theori __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the problem __PUNCT__
thei tri it __PUNCT__
thi countri tri that for the decad befor i took offic __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
we ar still pai trillion of dollar in tax cut for folk who didn't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__ and it didn't lead to better job or better wage for the middl class __PUNCT__
the lack of regul and rule on wall street wa exactli what allow peopl to take reckless shortcut that result in the crisi we still deal with __PUNCT__
so we don't need more top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
that my belief __PUNCT__
that my view __PUNCT__
we need somebodi who go to fight for the middl class __PUNCT__
i believ that how you grow the economi __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ look after work peopl and make sure thei got opportun __PUNCT__
that what i been fight for sinc i got into thi offic __PUNCT__
that what i be fight for as long as i have the privileg of be your presid __PUNCT__
in the last campaign __PUNCT__ i promis to cut tax for the middl class __PUNCT__ and i kept that promis __PUNCT__
we cut tax by about __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
four year later __PUNCT__ i run to keep middl class tax low __PUNCT__
thi week __PUNCT__ i call on congress to immedi extend these tax cut on everybodi who is make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__
now that __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
if you on of the __NUM__ percent whose incom ar less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ you would not see a dime of tax increas on your incom tax __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if congress doesn't act __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ million famili right here in virginia __PUNCT__ and i suspect most of you __PUNCT__ will see your tax go up by an averag of __MONEY__ on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you don't like that __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so we need to keep thi tax hike from happen __PUNCT__
but the republican in congress ar refus to act __PUNCT__
thei refus to let you keep your tax cut __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of american keep their tax cut __PUNCT__ unless we also spend an addit trillion dollar on tax cut for the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ thi is the same hous of repres that have now vote __NUM__ time to repeal health care __PUNCT__ __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
seem like onc a week thei vote __PUNCT__ even though thei know thei can't pass it __PUNCT__ thei vote to repeal health care __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ even though thei know it won't pass __PUNCT__
thei could take on vote to make sure your tax don't go up __PUNCT__ and thei haven't done that yet __PUNCT__
all becaus thei want to keep tax cut for millionair and billionair and folk like me who don't need it __PUNCT__
our live will not __PUNCT__ michel and i __PUNCT__ our live will not be better __PUNCT__
the averag __PUNCT__ warren buffett life is not go to be better if he get that addit tax cut __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ here the import thing __PUNCT__ the wai thi is organ __PUNCT__ the truth is __PUNCT__ those top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ thei still get a tax break __PUNCT__ just onli up to __MONEY__
the monei thei made after that __PUNCT__ that when thei would have to start pai slightli more __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__
if you believ that the recip for econom growth is to give the top __NUM__ percent addit tax break __PUNCT__ then by all mean you should send those folk to washington __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus that not what i believ __PUNCT__
that not why i in washington __PUNCT__
i there to fight for you __PUNCT__
i there to fight for the middl class __PUNCT__
i there to fight for famili who ar work hard everi singl dai __PUNCT__
peopl like me and governor romnei __PUNCT__ we do not need a tax cut __PUNCT__
and that part of what thi elect about __PUNCT__ becaus it repres these two differ view __PUNCT__ these two differ theori about how you grow the economi __PUNCT__
on almost everi issu in thi race __PUNCT__ the choic couldn't be more stark __PUNCT__
when america wa see it auto industri on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ my oppon said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
that would have cost about a million job __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ i bet on american worker __PUNCT__
i bet on american ingenu __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ gm is the number on automak again becaus we made that bet __PUNCT__
so now i run to make sure what happen in the auto industri is happen in other section of manufactur __PUNCT__
it doesn't just need to happen in detroit __PUNCT__ it need to happen in cleveland and raleigh and richmond and hampton __PUNCT__
governor romnei __PUNCT__ hi main claim to fame __PUNCT__ the reason he sai he can fix the economi is becaus of hi busi record __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

he want to keep give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to end those tax break __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that ar invest here in virginia __PUNCT__ invest in american worker __PUNCT__ invest in advanc american manufactur so we can sell our good around the world stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
i run becaus in __NUM__ i promis to end the war in iraq and i have __PUNCT__
i promis to go after al qaida leadership and we have __PUNCT__ and usama bin laden is no longer threaten america __PUNCT__
our brave men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ and virginia ha as mani veteran and folk serv in our arm forc as ani state in the countri __PUNCT__ and we could not be prouder of them __PUNCT__ but we start to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
and our nation secur is __PUNCT__ in part __PUNCT__ go to depend on what kind of economi do thei come back to __PUNCT__
can thei find job __PUNCT__ can thei start small busi __PUNCT__ and that why __PUNCT__ after a decad of war __PUNCT__ i want to take half the monei we save becaus we no longer fight in iraq and we wind down in afghanistan __PUNCT__ take half of that __PUNCT__ us it to pai down our deficit __PUNCT__ take the other half to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ our port __PUNCT__ our airport __PUNCT__
let lai broadband line that can reach into rural commun that ar isol __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ speed rail that can make sure that we on the forefront of the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__
that what i believ in __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we love barack obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i run again becaus we done a lot of work in educ __PUNCT__ but we got more to do __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure we ar provid everi singl child __PUNCT__ not just some kid __PUNCT__ not even just most kid __PUNCT__ but all kid __PUNCT__ the best educ possibl __PUNCT__
our tuition tax credit save million of famili thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
now i want to extend it __PUNCT__
we just won a fight with congress __PUNCT__
those of you who ar over at hampton __PUNCT__ other colleg and univers in the state __PUNCT__ we just won a fight to make sure that your loan rate would not doubl __PUNCT__
now i want to make sure that we actual bring down tuition and cost for colleg for everi young person who will to work hard to get an educ __PUNCT__
i want to make sure our school can hire the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg and get train for the job that busi ar hire right now __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ higher educ can't be a luxuri __PUNCT__
it is a vital necess __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
i want to fight to make sure that everybodi ha the chanc to get ahead __PUNCT__
my oppon plan to help respons homeown is to let foreclosur hit bottom __PUNCT__
that not a plan __PUNCT__
that not a solut __PUNCT__
that a problem __PUNCT__
my administr alreadi help a million respons homeown refin their mortgag __PUNCT__
i run to give everybodi a chanc to refin __PUNCT__
you could save __MONEY__ a year that you could then spend on go to a restaur and help a busi get more busi and fix the basement and rebuild the equiti in your home __PUNCT__
and that good for everybodi __PUNCT__
that good for the entir economi __PUNCT__
that an exampl of the kind of thing we could be do if we break thi stalem __PUNCT__
i run becaus i continu to believ that in america nobodi should go broke just becaus thei got sick __PUNCT__
i work with anybodi who want to continu to improv our health care system __PUNCT__
but the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
thi health care law is here to stai __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
if you got health insur __PUNCT__ noth chang for you __PUNCT__
you not be charg a tax __PUNCT__
the onli thing that happen to you is your insur is more secur becaus insur compani can't drop you becaus of some fine print or not cover your ill becaus you hit a lifetim limit __PUNCT__
insur compani now have to cover young peopl until thei __NUM__ on their parent plan __PUNCT__ which is help young peopl all across the countri __PUNCT__
we not go to let medicar get turn into a voucher system __PUNCT__
we not go to spend the next __NUM__ year refight the battl of the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we need to move forward __PUNCT__
and i am run to make sure that we pai down on our debt and reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but do so in a respons __PUNCT__ balanc wai __PUNCT__
and that mean __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ cut out program we can't afford __PUNCT__
i don't believ everi govern program work __PUNCT__ and govern shouldn't try to help everybodi __PUNCT__
if you don't want to get help __PUNCT__ we can't help you __PUNCT__
if you not will to work hard __PUNCT__ there onli so much that can be done __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ we not go to sacrific educ and train and basic research into thing like cancer and alzheim __PUNCT__
that would be shortsight __PUNCT__
so if we go to reduc our deficit and debt __PUNCT__ we have to do it smartli __PUNCT__ get rid of program that aren't help the economi grow __PUNCT__ but also ask the wealthiest to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
and that includ folk like me __PUNCT__
that includ peopl like mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ just like we tri their wai and it didn't work __PUNCT__ we tri what i propos and it did work __PUNCT__
bill clinton did it and we got __NUM__ million new job and a surplu instead of a deficit __PUNCT__ and a whole bunch of folk got rich in the process __PUNCT__
becaus in america __PUNCT__ when the middl class is do well and folk who ar poor and try to get into the middl class have a chanc __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
folk at the top do well becaus now thei got custom __PUNCT__
it good for everybodi __PUNCT__
that how we grow the economi togeth __PUNCT__
all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it bring back manufactur or construct job back __PUNCT__ protect health care __PUNCT__ make sure kid get the best educ __PUNCT__ make sure our veteran ar get the train thei need when thei come home __PUNCT__ all thi stuff ti togeth __PUNCT__
thei all part of that central idea __PUNCT__ that promis that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__ and the belief that we do that togeth __PUNCT__
when my grandfath got that gi bill __PUNCT__ when thi gener is get the post __PUNCT__ 9/11 gi bill __PUNCT__ that not just for them __PUNCT__ it for all of us __PUNCT__ becaus if thei do well __PUNCT__ we all do well __PUNCT__
when we built the golden gate bridg and the hoover dam and __PUNCT__ that wasn't just good for the folk in those state __PUNCT__ that good for the whole countri __PUNCT__ becaus it mean we move good and servic and peopl faster around the world and we more competit __PUNCT__
we rise or fall togeth __PUNCT__
and now we got an oblig to pass on that tradit to our children and our grandchildren __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you ar go to see all these neg ad with those voic of doom talk about how bad the economi is and how much it obama fault __PUNCT__
and you hear it __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ thei sai it everi which wai __PUNCT__ but it alwai the same argument __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ becaus thei know their econom theori doesn't sell becaus the fact ar it didn't work __PUNCT__
that their onli messag __PUNCT__
so all thei can sai is __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ it obama fault __PUNCT__ and if we get rid of him __PUNCT__ somehow mr __PUNCT__ romnei go to put it all back togeth __PUNCT__ although he won't tell you how __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that mai be a plan to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to grow the middl class __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reviv the american dream __PUNCT__
and the thing is __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ we been outspent befor __PUNCT__
we been count out befor __PUNCT__
when i announc in __NUM__ there wa a whole bunch of folk who didn't believ __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ everybodi now sai thei believ __PUNCT__ but there were a whole bunch of folk back then who didn't believ __PUNCT__
you know that right __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ through all the campaign __PUNCT__ what alwai given me hope is the american peopl __PUNCT__
there a core decenc __PUNCT__ there an honesti __PUNCT__ there a common sens that cut through all the nois and all the distract and all the nonsens __PUNCT__
what give me hope is rememb the stori of your famili becaus thei just like the stori of my famili __PUNCT__ all the struggl of parent and grandpar and great __PUNCT__ grandpar who went through struggl we can't even imagin but somehow came out on the other end __PUNCT__ who understand that even in the darkest of night there a brighter dai dawn __PUNCT__
some of them came here as immigr __PUNCT__
some folk came not of their own accord __PUNCT__
some came to work in mine __PUNCT__ some came to work in mill __PUNCT__ some work the farm __PUNCT__
and thei didn't alwai know what wa around the corner __PUNCT__ but what thei did understand wa there wa someth differ about america __PUNCT__
thei knew that in a land where peopl ar free to pursu their individu dream __PUNCT__ thei can still come togeth as on american famili __PUNCT__
thei knew that be middl class wasn't about how much wa in your bank account __PUNCT__ but it wa about an attitud that said if we work hard we can have enough __PUNCT__
we don't envi folk who succe __PUNCT__ we think it great if thei get rich __PUNCT__
but the main thing is famili and valu and be self __PUNCT__ reliant and look out for on anoth and help your neighbor and faith __PUNCT__ that what import __PUNCT__
it about the secur of know that you can take care of your famili and that your kid can do better than you did __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__
when peopl come togeth and tap into that basic __PUNCT__ honest core of america __PUNCT__ when ordinari folk start work togeth and point us in that direct __PUNCT__ we can't be stop __PUNCT__
all the monei __PUNCT__ all the special interest __PUNCT__ all the neg ad __PUNCT__ it can't stop you __PUNCT__
