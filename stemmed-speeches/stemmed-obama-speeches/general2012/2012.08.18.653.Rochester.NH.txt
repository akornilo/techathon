thi is a choic between two fundament differ vision for our countri __PUNCT__ two fundament differ idea about the direct that we should be go in __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth as democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and some republican __PUNCT__ becaus we knew we had to restor the basic bargain that built america __PUNCT__ what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__ what creat the greatest middl class we ever seen __PUNCT__
and it a pretti simpl bargain __PUNCT__
it the idea that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you should be abl to get ahead __PUNCT__
it a deal that sai __PUNCT__ if you put in enough effort and you act respons that you can find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ you can afford a home that you call your own __PUNCT__ you can count on health care when you get sick __PUNCT__ you can retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ most importantli __PUNCT__ you can give your kid the kind of educ and opportun that allow them to dream even bigger and do even better than you ever did __PUNCT__
that the american idea __PUNCT__
that what we came togeth to fight for in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it a simpl american promis __PUNCT__
and we knew it wouldn't be easi restor that promis __PUNCT__
we knew it would take more than on year or on term or even on presid becaus we had gone through a decad in which that promis wasn't be kept __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
i love you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you too __PUNCT__ sweeti __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we had seen a decad __PUNCT__ befor i came into offic __PUNCT__ in which job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__
we had run two war on a credit card __PUNCT__ gone from surplu to deficit __PUNCT__
wage and incom actual went down dure thi period __PUNCT__ even as the cost of everyth from health care and colleg were go up __PUNCT__
a few folk at the top were do realli __PUNCT__ realli well __PUNCT__ but for a lot of middl class famili __PUNCT__ folk were work harder and harder __PUNCT__ and seem like if you were lucki __PUNCT__ you were just tread water __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the econom crisi __PUNCT__ which hammer so mani famili all across thi state and all across thi countri __PUNCT__ peopl lose their job __PUNCT__ their home __PUNCT__ their save __PUNCT__ make the american dream even further out of reach __PUNCT__
so when i ran __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ when we talk about how we were go to restor that basic bargain __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i told you there were no quick fix __PUNCT__ there were no simpl solut __PUNCT__
but what i said wa if we were will to work hard and we were will to come togeth __PUNCT__ i had no doubt we could meet everi singl challeng becaus we got so mani thing go for us __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur and small businesspeopl in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research __PUNCT__ the best colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
compar to other develop countri __PUNCT__ we a young nation __PUNCT__
and part of it is becaus we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__
peopl still want to come here from everi corner of the globe becaus thei understand what america mean __PUNCT__
and so no matter what the naysay sai __PUNCT__ no matter how dark the other side tri to paint thing around elect time __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that would not gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thei understand __PUNCT__ we understand __PUNCT__ that here in america __PUNCT__ if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what the last __NUM__ year ha been about __PUNCT__ whether it been save the auto industri or get health care pass or creat 4½ million new job or make sure that young peopl have an easier time afford colleg __PUNCT__
it all about that idea of make sure hard work is reward __PUNCT__
that what my presid ha been about __PUNCT__ that is what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ that is why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon and hi new run mate __PUNCT__ thei just have a differ view of thing __PUNCT__
thei got wonder famili __PUNCT__ thei good peopl __PUNCT__ but thei believ in a differ vision __PUNCT__
thei think the best wai forward is the kind of top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
thei truli believ that if you roll back regul that we put in place to control wall street or if you get rid of regul we put in place to avoid our air get dirtier and our water get dirtier and then if you combin that with more tax break for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ then somehow prosper will come rain down on all of you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
that why we in a drought __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i not exagger here __PUNCT__
you can go on their web site __PUNCT__
look at congressman ryan budget __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of governor romnei entir econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to folk like me __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
hi new run mate __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ put forward a plan that would let governor romnei pai less than __NUM__ percent in tax each year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that a pretti good deal __PUNCT__ just pai __NUM__ percent in tax __PUNCT__ you make million of dollar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the kicker __PUNCT__ thei expect you to pick up the tab __PUNCT__
governor romnei tax plan would actual rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__
now __PUNCT__ thi is not my analysi __PUNCT__
thi is the analysi of independ economist whose job it is to analyz these plan __PUNCT__
everi media outlet check on the number here __PUNCT__ and their estim is that it would cost you an extra __MONEY__ not to grow the economi __PUNCT__ not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ not to make sure that our school ar work well or we build road or we strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__ all thi would be just to give anoth tax cut to folk like governor romnei __PUNCT__
it would give the averag person who is make more than __MONEY__ million a year anoth __MONEY__ in tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ governor romnei and congressman ryan will be here in new hampshir on mondai __PUNCT__ so you can tell them if you think thi is fair __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you should ask them __PUNCT__ how do you think that go to grow the economi again __PUNCT__ how is that go to strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we have tri thi kind of trickl __PUNCT__ down snake oil befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it didn't work then __PUNCT__
it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__ it not a plan to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ it not a plan to strengthen our economi __PUNCT__ it not a plan to strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__ it won't work __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
thei want to take us backward __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the truth is __PUNCT__ if you ask them or you ask their consult __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ thei know their econom plan isn't realli popular __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and that why thei got to be dishonest about my plan __PUNCT__
thei ar just throw everyth thei can at the wall to see if it stick __PUNCT__
their latest approach is to try to challeng me on medicar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let just think about thi for a second __PUNCT__ governor romnei want to turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__ congressman ryan want to turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ have strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
we made reform that extend the life of the program __PUNCT__ save million of senior with medicar hundr of dollar on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
we close the doughnut hole __PUNCT__
the onli chang to benefit that we made wa to make the benefit better by make sure that medicar now cover new prevent servic like cancer screen and well visit for free __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ governor romnei and congressman ryan want to give senior a voucher to bui insur on their own __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ somebodi did the analysi __PUNCT__ not us __PUNCT__ somebodi els __PUNCT__
and thei estim that thi could forc senior to pai as much as an extra __MONEY__ a year for their health care __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
how mani peopl think that a good deal __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
nobodi __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that doesn't strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
it undo the veri guarante of medicar __PUNCT__
but that the core of the plan that wa written by congressman ryan and endors by governor romnei __PUNCT__
and if thei want to talk about benefit __PUNCT__ thei should be straight with you __PUNCT__
those new cancer screen and prescript drug discount __PUNCT__ all those thing we put into place with the afford care act __PUNCT__ those thing would be elimin if governor romnei ha hi wai __PUNCT__
so it would take someth awai from senior __PUNCT__ and it wouldn't replac it with someth better __PUNCT__
so here the bottom line __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__
my plan save monei in medicar by crack down on fraud and wast and make sure insur compani aren't get unfair subsidi __PUNCT__
their plan make senior pai more so thei can give anoth tax cut to rich folk who don't need a tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
my plan ha extend the life of medicar by nearli a decad __PUNCT__
their plan would shorten the life of medicar and end medicar as we know it becaus thei turn it into a voucher system __PUNCT__
so those ar the differ between our plan on medicar __PUNCT__
but that just on exampl of the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what at stake __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
and you can see it on everi issu __PUNCT__
when it come to tax __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i came befor you and i said __PUNCT__ middl class famili need relief __PUNCT__ especi dure thi crisi __PUNCT__ i go to lower tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
guess what __PUNCT__ i kept that promis __PUNCT__
so if you start get into an argument with your republican cousin or friend or what have you __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you just tell them __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ the typic famili is pai __MONEY__ less in feder tax sinc presid obama came into offic __PUNCT__
and right now __PUNCT__ what i want to do is __PUNCT__ i want to keep tax right where thei ar for your first __MONEY__ of incom __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that mean __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of american make less than __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi make less than __MONEY__
so under my plan __PUNCT__ you wouldn't see your tax __PUNCT__ your incom tax __PUNCT__ go up a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
that a contrast with governor romnei plan __PUNCT__
but in the interest of full disclosur here __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still go to get a tax cut on the first __MONEY__ of incom __PUNCT__
you get to keep that __PUNCT__
all we ask is that you contribut a littl bit more so that we can pai down our deficit in a respons wai and invest in thing like educ that help us grow __PUNCT__
and you hear some peopl sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ just tax the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that won't elimin the deficit __PUNCT__
it true __PUNCT__
govern is still go to have to do it part in cut awai spend we don't need __PUNCT__
and we alreadi cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__ and we slate to do anoth trillion and a half under my budget plan __PUNCT__
but we not go to do it all on the back of middl class famili and gut educ and gut scienc and research and no longer invest in our infrastructur __PUNCT__
all we ask is that folk like me go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ work out pretti good __PUNCT__
we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we had a surplu instead of a deficit __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole bunch of new millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and part of the reason it work out pretti well __PUNCT__ when a teacher or a construct worker or a nurs or a receptionist __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl extra monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
thei spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei spend it on basic necess __PUNCT__
and that mean __PUNCT__ mayb that old beat up car you been hang on to for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ you decid __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ it time to get a new on __PUNCT__
or mayb you decid __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ our kid ar go to colleg __PUNCT__ let make sure thei got a new comput __PUNCT__
and that mean __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ which mean busi get more profit __PUNCT__ which mean thei then hire more worker __PUNCT__ which mean those worker then have a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__
everybodi doe better __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl out and the bottom up __PUNCT__
when everybodi is do well __PUNCT__ we all prosper __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
on issu after issu __PUNCT__ the choic could not be clearer __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
and 3½ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri is back __PUNCT__
governor romnei like to tout hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__ except a lot of that experi is invest in compani that have been call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
we don't need more outsourc __PUNCT__ we need some insourc __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ like governor romnei is promot __PUNCT__
i want to give those tax break to compani that ar invest right here in rochest __PUNCT__ right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ with american worker make american product __PUNCT__ sell them around the world __PUNCT__ stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__
my oppon think new sourc of clean homegrown energi like wind energi ar __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
that what he call them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ congressman ryan said thei were a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
listen __PUNCT__ sinc i took offic __PUNCT__ america ha doubl the us of renew energi __PUNCT__
thousand of good american job have been creat __PUNCT__
it help us to reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
that not imaginari __PUNCT__ that real __PUNCT__
we need to stop give __MONEY__ billion of taxpay subsidi to oil compani that ar make monei everi time you go to the pump __PUNCT__
let give those tax break to produc of clean __PUNCT__ renew energi right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i run becaus i made a promis to you in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
we transit in afghanistan so we can begin to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
all of thi wa accomplish onli becaus of the incred servic and sacrific of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ which is why we alreadi pass tax break for compani that hire veteran and we made histor invest in the va __PUNCT__ becaus my attitud is anybodi who ha fought for our countri shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
so now __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ after a decad of war __PUNCT__ i want to take some of those save __PUNCT__
and let do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let take about half the monei we no longer spend on war __PUNCT__ and let put it to us put peopl back to work rebuild road and runwai and port and wireless network and broadband line into rural commun __PUNCT__ and creat a veteran job corp that can help return hero get back to work as cop and firefight in commun that need them __PUNCT__
that the america we want to build __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want to make sure we got the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
so i want to help local school district hire and retain the veri best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ million more slot for american to go to commun colleg to learn the skill that busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to keep work to reduc the cost of tuition for colleg and univers becaus a higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__
it an econom necess in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
that a choic we got to make in thi elect __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ i run becaus i believ in thi nation __PUNCT__
i still believ you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
i actual kind of fond of the term obamacar __PUNCT__
i fought for that bill becaus i care __PUNCT__ becaus i care about the __NUM__ ½ million young peopl who can now get insur by stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__
i care about the million of senior who ar now get discount on their prescript drug and free prevent care becaus of what we did __PUNCT__
i care about all those folk here in new hampshir and around the countri with preexist condit who can now get health insur becaus of what we did __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
thi law is here to stai __PUNCT__
we don't need to refight thi battl for anoth 3½ __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we move forward __PUNCT__
we not go to put __PUNCT__ we not go to go back to the dai when serv the countri you love depend on who you love __PUNCT__
we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
i believ women should be in charg of their own health care decis __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
on issu after issu __PUNCT__ there is a clear choic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side is go to spend more monei than we have ever seen __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei ar write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__ individu __PUNCT__ just to run the same ad over and over again __PUNCT__
it variat on the same theme __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it need to be and it obama fault __PUNCT__
thei just sai that over and over again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the reason thei got to sai that __PUNCT__ that their onli messag __PUNCT__ is becaus thei know their econom plan won't sell __PUNCT__
thei mai have a plan to win the elect __PUNCT__ but thei don't have a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to help the middl class __PUNCT__
i do __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__
i been outspent befor __PUNCT__
i been count out befor __PUNCT__
but what give me hope __PUNCT__ what give me confid __PUNCT__ is you __PUNCT__
becaus i know when the american peopl start pai attent after all the ad have been done and thei cut through all the nonsens and thei start rememb the stori of their famili __PUNCT__ their parent __PUNCT__ their grandpar __PUNCT__ all the struggl thei went through __PUNCT__ what it mean to work hard and get ahead and overcom obstacl __PUNCT__ the same kind of stori i got in my life as a son of a singl mom __PUNCT__ the same kind of stori that michel ha in her life __PUNCT__ her parent __PUNCT__ dad a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__ mom a secretari __PUNCT__
we know what it been like to go through hard time __PUNCT__
but we also know what it like to have hope and determin and resili and to watch the next gener do better __PUNCT__
and when you gui ar focus on that idea __PUNCT__ which is the essenc of who we ar __PUNCT__ then all that other monei __PUNCT__ all that other stuff __PUNCT__ doesn't matter __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ i go to need your help __PUNCT__
we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
we still got more good job to creat __PUNCT__ more good teacher to hire __PUNCT__ more student to help to go to colleg __PUNCT__ more troop to bring home __PUNCT__ more homegrown energi to gener __PUNCT__ more door of opportun to open for everybodi who is will to walk through them and work hard and put in the effort __PUNCT__
and if you will to stand with me on more time __PUNCT__ if you will to knock on some door and make some phone call __PUNCT__ talk to your friend and talk to your neighbor __PUNCT__ we will finish what we start __PUNCT__
we will win new hampshir __PUNCT__
we will win thi elect __PUNCT__
and we remind the world why the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__
god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
