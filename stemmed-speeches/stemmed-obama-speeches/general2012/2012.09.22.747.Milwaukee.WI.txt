no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei can't find the right skill here in the unit state __PUNCT__

we can't be wast monei __PUNCT__
but i also want to reform our tax code so that it simpl and fair __PUNCT__ and so it ask the wealthiest among us to pai a higher rate on incom over __MONEY__
that the rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ and our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
i cut tax for the middl class __PUNCT__
i cut tax for small busi __PUNCT__
and i want to keep your tax low __PUNCT__
but i can afford to pai a littl more __PUNCT__ and mitt romnei sure can afford to pai a littl more __PUNCT__
and the reason i want to do it is not becaus i want to punish success __PUNCT__
it when you give tax relief to middl class famili __PUNCT__ what do you do when you got a littl more monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__

mayb you bui a comput for your kid __PUNCT__
and that mean busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ which mean thei __PUNCT__ compani have more profit __PUNCT__ which mean then thei hire more peopl __PUNCT__
and then the whole economi get stronger __PUNCT__
we don't build the economi from the top down __PUNCT__
we build it from the bottom up __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__
