look __PUNCT__ i understand it not alwai pretti to watch __PUNCT__
there ha been more monei flood into the system than we ever seen befor __PUNCT__
more neg ad __PUNCT__ more cynic __PUNCT__
most of what you read about or hear about on the new ha to do with who is up or down in the poll __PUNCT__ instead of what these issu actual mean for you and for america __PUNCT__
so it can be frustrat __PUNCT__
and i know sometim it mai be tempt to kind of turn awai from all of it and just turn off the tv __PUNCT__ tivo everyth that you want to watch so you can skip over the commerci __PUNCT__
it easi sometim __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ to lose interest and lose heart when you hear what go on in washington __PUNCT__
and i be honest with you __PUNCT__ i think there ar some folk who ar bet that you will lose interest __PUNCT__ that ar bet that somehow you go to lose heart __PUNCT__
but here you ar in the heat __PUNCT__
i bet you not go to lose interest __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i bet you not go to lose heart __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i still believ in you __PUNCT__
i bet on you __PUNCT__
and the countri is bet on you __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
becaus you understand that __PUNCT__ even though polit mai seem real small right now and mai seem real petti __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect could not be clearer __PUNCT__
and it could not be bigger __PUNCT__ the stake could not be bigger __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
you can do it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i know __PUNCT__ with you __PUNCT__
what go on in thi elect is bigger than just a choic between two candid or between two parti __PUNCT__
it about two fundament differ vision of where we go as a countri __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ i believ in an america where no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
we never been a countri that __PUNCT__ we never been a countri look for handout __PUNCT__
we a nation of striver and risk taker and entrepreneur __PUNCT__ worker __PUNCT__
but what we ask for is that hard work pai off __PUNCT__ that respons is reward __PUNCT__
the idea is if you take respons for your life __PUNCT__ if you put in the effort __PUNCT__ if you do the respons thing __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that pai a live wage __PUNCT__ that you can look after your famili __PUNCT__ that you can bui a home __PUNCT__ that you can retir with some digniti and some respect __PUNCT__ that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ that you have that core __PUNCT__ middl class secur that built thi countri __PUNCT__ and that you can pass that on to your kid so thei can do thing that you never even imagin __PUNCT__
that the essenc of america __PUNCT__
and i believ in that basic promis of america becaus i live it __PUNCT__
that my biographi __PUNCT__
i had grandpar whose servic at world war ii wa reward by them have a chanc to go to colleg and bui their first home __PUNCT__
becaus i had a hard __PUNCT__ work mom who rais me and my sister right __PUNCT__ but also had some help so that we could end up go to the best school in the countri even though we didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__
i got involv in polit __PUNCT__
i ran for presid in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and some of you join me in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ becaus we believ in that basic bargain that built the largest middl class in histori and the strongest economi in the world __PUNCT__
and we felt like that basic bargain wa slip awai __PUNCT__ that hard work wasn't alwai reward __PUNCT__ that be respons didn't alwai get you ahead __PUNCT__ that folk who act irrespons sometim were make out like bandit while ordinari folk were have a tougher and tougher time __PUNCT__
so we came togeth in that elect __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ some republican __PUNCT__ to restor that basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__
and we knew at the time it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it would take more than on year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__
but what we didn't realiz at the time wa we were go to be hit by the worst econom crisi in our lifetim __PUNCT__
and that been tough on a lot of folk __PUNCT__ includ peopl here in ohio __PUNCT__
it rob million of peopl of their job and their home and their save __PUNCT__
and it push the american dream even further from reach for a lot of peopl __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ thi crisi ha not chang the fundament charact of america __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang the fundament charact of thi town __PUNCT__ or thi state __PUNCT__ or thi part of the countri __PUNCT__
we still got peopl who ar work hard __PUNCT__
we still got peopl who ar act respons __PUNCT__
it hasn't diminish our belief in those ideal we were fight for in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and our mission right now isn't just to recov from thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ although that job on __PUNCT__
our mission is to give back to america __PUNCT__ to american all across the countri __PUNCT__ what been lost __PUNCT__ that sens of secur __PUNCT__
our goal isn't just to put peopl back to work tomorrow __PUNCT__ it also to build for the long haul an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ an economi where everybodi __PUNCT__ whether you start a busi or punch a clock __PUNCT__ ha confid that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you will get ahead __PUNCT__
that what america is about __PUNCT__
that what ohio is about __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ what hold us back is not __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
where is michel __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
where michel __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i know i second fiddl __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i have michel come back sometim __PUNCT__
i just the warmup act __PUNCT__
michel sai hi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thank you so much __PUNCT__
i appreci it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__
what hold us back from go ahead and meet these challeng __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what hold us back from meet our challeng __PUNCT__ it not a lack of idea __PUNCT__ it not a lack of solut __PUNCT__
what hold us back is we got a stalem in washington between these two vision of where the countri need to go __PUNCT__
and thi elect is all about break that stalem __PUNCT__
the outcom of thi elect will determin our econom futur not just for the next year or the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but mayb for the next decad or the next two __PUNCT__
and i want everybodi to be clear about what thi choic is __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei believ prosper come from the top down __PUNCT__
thei believ if we elimin most regul and we cut tax for the wealthi by trillion of dollar __PUNCT__ that somehow our whole economi will benefit __PUNCT__ and all of you will benefit __PUNCT__ and there go to be more job and better secur for everybodi __PUNCT__
that their basic econom plan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think thei wrong about their vision __PUNCT__
and part of the reason i think thei wrong is becaus we tri it __PUNCT__ rememb __PUNCT__ just a while back __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
it didn't work __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
we still pai for trillion of dollar in tax cut that weren't paid for and didn't lead to better job or better wage for the middl class __PUNCT__
the lack of regul on wall street __PUNCT__ the kind of thing that thei prescrib __PUNCT__ that exactli what allow peopl to game the system that caus thi whole mess in the first place __PUNCT__
so no __PUNCT__ i don't think that mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan to spend trillion of dollar more on tax cut for folk who don't need them and aren't even ask for them is the right wai to grow our economi __PUNCT__ especi sinc thei want to pai for it by cut educ spend and cut job train program and rais middl class tax __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and i sure don't agre with hi plan to keep give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i don't think we better off by roll back regul on bank or insur compani or oil compani __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ regul that ar meant to protect worker and consum and famili and our economi __PUNCT__
so we don't need more top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
we tri it __PUNCT__ it did not work __PUNCT__
what we need is somebodi who is out there fight for the middl class and want to grow the middl class __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ and more than on million job were on the line __PUNCT__ governor romnei said we should just let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
that what he said __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i refus to turn my back on commun like thi on __PUNCT__
i wa bet on the american worker __PUNCT__ and i wa bet on american industri __PUNCT__

that chrysler plant up the road bring on anoth __NUM__ employe to make the car that the world want to bui __PUNCT__
the wrangler built right here in toledo just set an alltim sale record __PUNCT__

governor romnei experi ha been in own compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
that not my phrase __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
my experi ha been in save the american auto industri __PUNCT__
and as long as i presid __PUNCT__ that what i go to be do __PUNCT__ wake up everi singl dai think about how we can creat more job for your famili and more secur for your commun __PUNCT__
that why my administr brought trade case against china at a faster pace than the previou administr __PUNCT__ and we won those case __PUNCT__
just thi morn __PUNCT__ my administr took a new action to hold china account for unfair trade practic that harm american automak __PUNCT__
and let me tell you someth __PUNCT__
american aren't afraid to compet __PUNCT__
we believ in competit __PUNCT__
i believ in trade __PUNCT__
and i know thi __PUNCT__ american and american worker build better product than anybodi els __PUNCT__
so as long as we compet on a fair plai field instead of an unfair plai field __PUNCT__ we do just fine __PUNCT__
but we go to make sure that competit is fair __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
that part of our vision for america __PUNCT__
but that not all it take to rebuild thi economi __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that america onc again lead the world in educ our kid and train our worker __PUNCT__
our tuition tax credit ha save million of famili thousand of dollar each __PUNCT__ and now i want to extend it __PUNCT__

i want our school to hire and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg and learn skill that local busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess for everi singl on of our young peopl __PUNCT__ and folk who ar retrain to get the job of the futur __PUNCT__ and our veteran who ar come home __PUNCT__
