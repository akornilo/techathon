that i can sai with some confid __PUNCT__
and the reason you here tonight is becaus no matter how petti and small polit seem sometim __PUNCT__ you recogn that the stake could not be bigger __PUNCT__
in some wai __PUNCT__ the stake ar even bigger now than thei were in __NUM__ becaus what at stake is not just two peopl or two polit parti __PUNCT__
what at stake is a decis between two fundament differ view about where we take the countri right now __PUNCT__
and the choic is up to you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
aww __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ it true __PUNCT__
there is a term limit for presid __PUNCT__
you get two __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so no matter what happen __PUNCT__ thi will be my last campaign __PUNCT__
and it make you nostalg sometim __PUNCT__ and i start think about some of my first campaign __PUNCT__
when i wa travel across illinoi __PUNCT__ and illinoi is a big state __PUNCT__
and it got big citi like chicago __PUNCT__ and it got small town __PUNCT__ and it got rural area and suburban area __PUNCT__ and you meet peopl from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__
you stop in vfw hall __PUNCT__ you stop in diner __PUNCT__ you go to church __PUNCT__ you go to synagogu __PUNCT__
wherev you go __PUNCT__ you go to have a chanc to meet peopl from differ walk of life __PUNCT__
and when i think about that first campaign __PUNCT__ what strike me is __PUNCT__ no matter where i went __PUNCT__ no matter who i wa talk to __PUNCT__ i could see my own life in the life of the peopl whose vote i wa ask for __PUNCT__
so i meet an elderli vet __PUNCT__ and i think about my grandfath who fought in world war ii and my grandmoth who work on a bomber assembl line dure the war __PUNCT__
and i think about how __PUNCT__ when my grandfath came back home __PUNCT__ becaus of thi countri __PUNCT__ he wa abl to get an educ on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to bui their first home us an fha loan __PUNCT__
and then i meet a singl mom somewher and i think about my mom __PUNCT__
i never knew my dad __PUNCT__
he left when i wa just bare a babi __PUNCT__ and so __PUNCT__ and my mother didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ and she wa struggl __PUNCT__ and she had to go back to school rais a kid __PUNCT__ later rais my sister __PUNCT__ and she had to work while she wa in school __PUNCT__
but despit all that __PUNCT__ becaus she wa in america __PUNCT__ she wa abl to get grant and scholarship __PUNCT__
and her kid were abl to get grant and scholarship __PUNCT__
and thei could go as far as their dream could take them __PUNCT__
and then i talk to some work folk __PUNCT__ and i think about michel famili __PUNCT__ her dad who wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__ work at a water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__ and her mom wa a secretari __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ despit never have a lot __PUNCT__ there wa so much love and so much passion __PUNCT__ and her dad had ms __PUNCT__ so he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els just to get to work becaus it took him that long to get dress __PUNCT__ and he could bare walk __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai work __PUNCT__ becaus he took pride in the idea that __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ i go to earn my wai and look after my famili __PUNCT__
and i see that same pride in the peopl i wa talk to __PUNCT__
and what thi remind me of wa that __PUNCT__ at the heart of thi countri __PUNCT__ it central idea is the idea that in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ if you will to take respons __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that you can find a job that support a famili and find a home you can make your own __PUNCT__ that you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
that mayb you can take a littl vacat with your famili onc in a while __PUNCT__ noth fanci __PUNCT__ but just time to spend with those you love __PUNCT__
mayb see the countri a littl bit __PUNCT__ mayb come down to roanok __PUNCT__
that your kid can get a great educ __PUNCT__ and if thei will to work hard __PUNCT__ then thei can achiev thing that you wouldn't have even imagin achiev __PUNCT__
and then you can mayb retir with some digniti and some respect and be part of a commun and give someth back __PUNCT__
that the idea of america __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter what you look like __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter where you come from __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter what your last name is __PUNCT__
you can live out the american dream __PUNCT__
that what bind us all togeth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason that i think so mani of us came togeth in __NUM__ wa becaus we saw that for a decad __PUNCT__ that dream wa frai __PUNCT__ that it wa slip awai __PUNCT__ that there were too mani peopl who were work hard __PUNCT__ but not see their incom or wage go up __PUNCT__ that we had taken a surplu and turn it into a deficit __PUNCT__ we were run two war on a credit card __PUNCT__ that job growth wa the most sluggish it had been in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
there wa a sens that those who were in charg didn't feel respons __PUNCT__
and so we came togeth to sai we ar go to bring about the kind of chang that allow us to get back to those basic __PUNCT__ allow us to restor and live out those valu __PUNCT__
what we didn't realiz wa that some of that reckless __PUNCT__ some of that irrespons would lead to the worst financi crisi we seen sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and i don't need to tell you what we been through over the last 3Â½ year becaus you live it __PUNCT__
too mani folk lost job __PUNCT__
too mani peopl saw their home lose valu __PUNCT__
too mani folk saw their save take a hit __PUNCT__
but you know what given me confid and faith is that fact that as i travel around the countri now __PUNCT__ just like i us to travel around illinoi __PUNCT__ that same decenc __PUNCT__ those same valu __PUNCT__ thei still aliv __PUNCT__ at least outsid washington __PUNCT__
time have been tough __PUNCT__ but america charact hasn't chang __PUNCT__
the core decenc of the american peopl is undiminish __PUNCT__
our willing to fight through and work through the tough time and come togeth __PUNCT__ that still there __PUNCT__
and so just as we came togeth in the last campaign __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ but republican and independ __PUNCT__ becaus we not democrat or republican first __PUNCT__ we american first __PUNCT__
just like we came togeth in __NUM__ we know that we got to keep work __PUNCT__ got to keep move forward in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and we knew back then that it wasn't go to be easi __PUNCT__
these problem we face __PUNCT__ thei didn't happen overnight __PUNCT__ and thei not go to be solv overnight __PUNCT__
we understood it might take more than __NUM__ year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
but what we also understood wa that we weren't go to stop until we had restor that basic american bargain that make us the greatest countri on earth __PUNCT__
our goal isn't just to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ although that prioriti number on __PUNCT__ it is to build an economi where that work pai off __PUNCT__
an economi where everyon __PUNCT__ whether you ar start a busi or punch a clock __PUNCT__ can see your hard work and respons reward __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign about __PUNCT__ roanok __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__
it fashion among some pundit __PUNCT__ and thi happen everi time america hit a rough patch __PUNCT__ it fashion to be sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thi time it differ __PUNCT__ thi time we realli ar in the soup __PUNCT__ it go to be hard to solv our problem __PUNCT__
let me tell you someth __PUNCT__
what miss is not big idea __PUNCT__
what miss is not that we got an absenc of technic solut to deal with issu like educ or energi or our deficit __PUNCT__
the problem we got right now is we just got a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
and the outcom of thi debat that we have is go to set the stage not just for the next year or __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but for the next __NUM__ __PUNCT__
on the on side you got my oppon in thi presidenti race and hi republican alli who __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
who __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we have a good __PUNCT__ healthi __PUNCT__ democrat debat __PUNCT__
that how thi work __PUNCT__
and on their side __PUNCT__ thei got a basic theori about how you grow the economi __PUNCT__
and the theori is veri simpl __PUNCT__ thei think that the economi grow from the top down __PUNCT__
so their basic theori is __PUNCT__ if wealthi investor ar do well __PUNCT__ then everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
so if we spend trillion of dollar on more tax cut mostli for the wealthi __PUNCT__ that that somehow go to creat job __PUNCT__ even if we have to pai for it by gut educ and gut job train program and gut transport project and mayb even see middl class folk have a higher tax burden __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that part number on __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__
more tax cut for those at the top __PUNCT__
part number two is thei believ if you tear down all the regul that we put in place __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ on wall street bank or on insur compani or on credit card compani or on pollut __PUNCT__ that somehow the economi is go to do much __PUNCT__ much better __PUNCT__
so those ar their two theori __PUNCT__
thei got the tax cut for the high end __PUNCT__ and thei got rollback regul __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the problem __PUNCT__
you mai have guess __PUNCT__ we tri thi __PUNCT__
we tri thi in the last decad __PUNCT__ and it did not work __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ befor i finish __PUNCT__ can i sai __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ that some of you have been stand for a while __PUNCT__ and i see a coupl folk slump down a littl bit __PUNCT__
make sure you drink water __PUNCT__
bend your knee __PUNCT__
don't stand up too straight __PUNCT__
the paraleg will be __PUNCT__ the paraleg __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you don't need lawyer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the paramed will be come by __PUNCT__ so just give folk a littl bit of room __PUNCT__ thei be fine __PUNCT__
thi happen at everi event __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__
but i just want to point out that we tri their theori for almost __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and here what it got us __PUNCT__ we got the slowest job growth in decad __PUNCT__
we got deficit as far as the ey can see __PUNCT__
your incom and your wage didn't go up __PUNCT__
and it culmin in a crisi becaus there weren't enough regul on wall street and thei could make reckless bet with other peopl monei that result in thi financi crisi __PUNCT__ and you had to foot the bill __PUNCT__
so that where their theori turn out __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we don't need more top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
i got a differ view __PUNCT__
i believ that the wai you grow the economi is from the middl out __PUNCT__
i believ that you grow the economi from the bottom up __PUNCT__
i believ that when work peopl ar do well __PUNCT__ the countri doe well __PUNCT__
i believ in fight for the middl class becaus if thei prosper __PUNCT__ all of us will prosper __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is what i been focus on sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis to make sure that middl class tax didn't go up __PUNCT__
and in fact __PUNCT__ becaus of the recess __PUNCT__ you need some help __PUNCT__ so we cut the typic famili incom tax by __MONEY__
so if you hear somebodi sai that i a big tax gui __PUNCT__ you just rememb __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
that the tax break you gotten sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__
four year later __PUNCT__ i run to keep middl class tax low __PUNCT__
so thi week __PUNCT__ i call on congress to immedi extend incom tax cut on the first __MONEY__ of incom __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what that mean is __NUM__ percent of american make less than __MONEY__ so __NUM__ percent of folk would have the certainti and secur that your tax __PUNCT__ your incom tax __PUNCT__ would not go up a dime __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ thi is not a hypothet __PUNCT__
thi wasn't some campaign promis __PUNCT__
the reason i call on congress to act now is becaus if thei don't do anyth __PUNCT__ on __DATE__ almost everybodi here __PUNCT__ your tax will go up an averag of __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so we need to stop that tax hike from happen __PUNCT__
so you would think that thi make sens __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ becaus the republican sai thei the parti of no new tax __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ that what thei alwai sai __PUNCT__
except so far __PUNCT__ thei refus to act __PUNCT__
and thi might confus you __PUNCT__
you might sai __PUNCT__ why would thei not want to give __NUM__ percent of american the certainti of thi incom tax cut __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it turn out thei don't want you to get your tax break unless the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ thei get their tax break as well __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ understand __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ folk like me __PUNCT__ we the on who most benefit over the last decad from not onli tax break __PUNCT__ but also a lot of the monei from increas profit and product went up to that top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
so the bottom line is __PUNCT__ the top __NUM__ percent doesn't need help __PUNCT__
thei do just fine __PUNCT__
and i understand why thei wouldn't want to pai more in tax __PUNCT__
nobodi like to pai more in tax __PUNCT__
here the problem __PUNCT__ if you continu their tax break __PUNCT__ that cost a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
and sinc we try to bring down our deficit and our debt __PUNCT__ if we spend a trillion dollar on tax cut for them __PUNCT__ we go to have to find that trillion dollar someplac els __PUNCT__
that mean we go to have to mayb make student loan more expens for student __PUNCT__
or we might have to cut back on the servic we provid our brave veteran when thei come home __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we might have to stop invest in basic scienc and research that keep us as a lead __PUNCT__ edg economi __PUNCT__
or __PUNCT__ as thei suggest __PUNCT__ mayb you would have to turn medicar into a voucher program __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i don't think those ar good idea __PUNCT__
so what i said to the republican is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ let have thi debat about the tax cut for the wealthiest folk __PUNCT__
i don't mind have that debat __PUNCT__
but in the meantim __PUNCT__ let go ahead and do what we agre on __PUNCT__ which is give __NUM__ percent of american some certainti and some secur __PUNCT__
so far __PUNCT__ thei haven't taken me up on my offer __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here __PUNCT__ thi give you a sens of how congress work these dai __PUNCT__ you got the possibl of your tax go up in four month __PUNCT__ five month __PUNCT__ and instead of work on that __PUNCT__ guess what thei work on thi week __PUNCT__ thei work __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
noth __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei vote for the 33d time to try to repeal a health care bill we pass __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ after the suprem court said it constitut __PUNCT__
and we ar go to go ahead and implement that law __PUNCT__
i don't know about you __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ but i think thei got a better wai to us their time __PUNCT__
i think help you make sure your tax don't go up __PUNCT__ that would be a good us of congression time __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is just a small exampl of the differ between myself and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ between myself and some of the republican who ar run congress __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ i want to repeat __PUNCT__ thi is a choic __PUNCT__
if you think their wai of do thing is a recip for econom growth and help the middl class __PUNCT__ then you should vote for them __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you can send those folk to washington __PUNCT__
i promis you thei will carri out what thei promis to do __PUNCT__
but that not why i went to washington __PUNCT__
i went to washington to fight for the middl class __PUNCT__
i went to washington to fight for work peopl who ar try to get into the middl class and have some sens of secur in their live __PUNCT__
peopl like me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei don't need anoth tax cut __PUNCT__
you need some help right now to make sure your kid ar live the kind of life you want for them __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on almost everi issu __PUNCT__ you got the same kind of choic __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa about to go under __PUNCT__ a million job lost __PUNCT__ and my oppon said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ what did i sai __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i said i bet on america worker __PUNCT__
i bet on american industri __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ three year later __PUNCT__ gm is number on again __PUNCT__ and the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so i believ in american manufactur __PUNCT__
i believ in make stuff here in america __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ he invest in compani who ar call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
i don't believ in outsourc __PUNCT__ i believ in insourc __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ let give tax break to compani that ar invest right here in roanok __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let invest in american worker so thei can make product and ship them around the world with those three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
i run becaus our men and women in uniform have sacrif so much __PUNCT__
we could not be prouder of them __PUNCT__ we could not be prouder of our veteran __PUNCT__
and becaus of their effort __PUNCT__ i wa abl to keep my promis and end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
and i now intend to transit out of afghanistan and bring our troop home __PUNCT__
and what i said is __PUNCT__ becaus of their outstand work __PUNCT__ we been abl to decim al qaida and take out bin laden __PUNCT__
and so now it time for us to take half of the monei we save on war and pai down our deficit and us the other half to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
roanok know someth about transport __PUNCT__ thi wa a railroad hub for a long time __PUNCT__
so you know how import that is to grow an economi __PUNCT__
let take some of that monei and rebuild our road and our bridg and our rail system __PUNCT__ and let build wireless network into rural commun so everybodi can tap into world market __PUNCT__
let put construct worker back to work do what thei do best __PUNCT__ and that is rebuild america __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
that the choic you face __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that our kid ar get the best educ in the world __PUNCT__
when i came into offic __PUNCT__ we pass a tuition tax credit that ha save million of famili thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ and now i want to extend it __PUNCT__
but i don't want to stop there __PUNCT__
we just won a fight __PUNCT__ thank to some of the folk who ar here __PUNCT__ includ student from vt that __PUNCT__ we just won a fight to make sure that student loan interest rate would not doubl __PUNCT__
but that not enough __PUNCT__
i want to lower tuition to make it more afford for all young peopl __PUNCT__
i want to help our elementari school and our middl school and our high school hire more teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want __NUM__ million more peopl to be abl to go to commun colleg to get train in the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__ becaus a higher educ __PUNCT__ a good educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess __PUNCT__
that how we go to win the race for the futur __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__ to finish the job we start in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ at thi point __PUNCT__ an audienc member collaps __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ we got anoth person down there __PUNCT__
okai __PUNCT__ we see him __PUNCT__
we got to deal with homeownership __PUNCT__ and the fact of the matter is that my oppon philosophi when it come to deal with homeown is __PUNCT__ let the market bottom out and let as mani foreclosur happen as it take __PUNCT__
i don't think that part of a solut __PUNCT__ that part of the problem __PUNCT__
so what i want to do is __PUNCT__ i want to let everi singl person refin their home and save about __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ becaus you spend that __MONEY__ on some of these store right here in downtown __PUNCT__
you help small busi and larg busi grow becaus thei have more custom __PUNCT__
it will be good for you __PUNCT__ and it will be good for the economi __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__ becaus i want to help america homeown __PUNCT__
i am run becaus i still believ that you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
we pass that health care law becaus it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and becaus we did __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million peopl who don't have health insur ar go to get help get health insur __PUNCT__
six million young peopl who didn't have health insur can now stai on their parent plan and get health insur __PUNCT__
senior ar see their prescript drug cost go down __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ if you got health insur __PUNCT__ you not get hit by a tax __PUNCT__
the onli thing that happen to you is that you now have more secur becaus insur compani can't drop you when you get sick __PUNCT__
and thei can't mess around with you becaus of some fine print in your polici __PUNCT__
if you pai your polici __PUNCT__ you will get the deal that you paid for __PUNCT__
that why we pass health care reform __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ on last thing __PUNCT__ on of the biggest differ is how we pai down our debt and our deficit __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan is he want to cut tax anoth __MONEY__ trillion on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ like i said __PUNCT__ the onli wai you can pai for that __PUNCT__ if you actual sai you bring down the deficit __PUNCT__ is to cut transport __PUNCT__ cut educ __PUNCT__ cut basic research __PUNCT__ voucher medicar __PUNCT__ and you still go to end up have to rais tax on middl class famili to pai for thi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
that not a deficit reduct plan __PUNCT__
that a deficit expans plan __PUNCT__
i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
i do believ we can cut __PUNCT__ we alreadi made a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of cut __PUNCT__
we can make some more cut in program that don't work and make govern work more effici __PUNCT__
not everi govern program work the wai it suppos to __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ govern can't solv everi problem __PUNCT__
if somebodi doesn't want to be help __PUNCT__ govern can't alwai help them __PUNCT__
parent __PUNCT__ we can put more monei into school __PUNCT__ but if your kid don't want to learn it hard to teach them __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ i not go to see us gut the invest that grow our economi to give tax break to me or mr __PUNCT__ romnei or folk who don't need them __PUNCT__
so i go to reduc the deficit in a balanc wai __PUNCT__
we alreadi made a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of cut __PUNCT__
we can make anoth trillion or trillion __PUNCT__ two __PUNCT__ and what we then do is ask for the wealthi to pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we tri that befor __PUNCT__ a gui name bill clinton did it __PUNCT__
we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ turn a deficit into a surplu __PUNCT__ and rich peopl did just fine __PUNCT__
we creat a lot of millionair __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of wealthi __PUNCT__ success american who agre with me __PUNCT__ becaus thei want to give someth back __PUNCT__
thei know thei didn't __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ if you been success __PUNCT__ you didn't get there on your own __PUNCT__
you didn't get there on your own __PUNCT__
i alwai struck by peopl who think __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it must be becaus i wa just so smart __PUNCT__
there ar a lot of smart peopl out there __PUNCT__
it must be becaus i work harder than everybodi els __PUNCT__
let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ there ar a whole bunch of hard __PUNCT__ work peopl out there __PUNCT__
if you were success __PUNCT__ somebodi along the line gave you some help __PUNCT__
there wa a great teacher somewher in your life __PUNCT__
somebodi help to creat thi unbeliev american system that we have that allow you to thrive __PUNCT__
somebodi invest in road and bridg __PUNCT__
if you got a busi __PUNCT__ you didn't build that __PUNCT__
somebodi els made that happen __PUNCT__
the internet didn't get invent on it own __PUNCT__
govern research creat the internet so that all the compani could make monei off the internet __PUNCT__
the point is __PUNCT__ is that when we succe __PUNCT__ we succe becaus of our individu initi __PUNCT__ but also becaus we do thing togeth __PUNCT__
there ar some thing __PUNCT__ just like fight fire __PUNCT__ we don't do on our own __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ imagin if everybodi had their own fire servic __PUNCT__
that would be a hard wai to organ fight fire __PUNCT__
so we sai to ourselv __PUNCT__ ever sinc the found of thi countri __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ there ar some thing we do better togeth __PUNCT__
that how we fund the gi bill __PUNCT__
that how we creat the middl class __PUNCT__
that how we built the golden gate bridg or the hoover dam __PUNCT__
that how we invent the internet __PUNCT__
that how we sent a man to the moon __PUNCT__
we rise or fall togeth as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__ and that the reason i run for presid __PUNCT__ becaus i still believ in that idea __PUNCT__
you not on your own __PUNCT__ we in thi togeth __PUNCT__
so all these issu go back to that first campaign that i talk about __PUNCT__ becaus everyth ha to do with how do we help middl class famili __PUNCT__ work peopl __PUNCT__ striver __PUNCT__ doer __PUNCT__ how do we help them succe __PUNCT__ how do we make sure that their hard work pai off __PUNCT__ that what i been think about the entir time i been presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side is go to spend more monei than we even seen in histori __PUNCT__
and thei don't realli have a good argument for how thei do better __PUNCT__ but thei think thei can win the elect if thei just remind peopl that a lot of peopl ar still out of work and the economi is not grow as fast as it need to and it all obama fault __PUNCT__
that basic their pitch __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ i just tell you __PUNCT__
you seen the ad __PUNCT__ and thei go to run more of them __PUNCT__ and there will be all kind of variat on the same theme __PUNCT__
but it will be the same basic messag over and over and over and over and over again __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ their ad mai be a plan to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
it not a plan to strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__
and the reason it doesn't worri me is becaus we been outspent befor __PUNCT__
we been count out befor __PUNCT__
the pundit __PUNCT__ thei didn't think i could win virginia the last time __PUNCT__
the last time i came to thi part of virginia __PUNCT__ all the polit writer __PUNCT__ thei all __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he not seriou __PUNCT__ he just make a tactic move __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i seriou __PUNCT__ i go to get some vote down here __PUNCT__
and so the reason that i continu to have confid is becaus when i look at you __PUNCT__ i see my grandpar __PUNCT__
when i see your kid __PUNCT__ i see my kid __PUNCT__
and i think about all those previou gener __PUNCT__ our parent and grandpar and great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__
some of them came here as immigr __PUNCT__ some were brought here against their will __PUNCT__
some of them work on farm __PUNCT__ and some work in mill __PUNCT__ and some work in mine __PUNCT__ and some work on the railroad __PUNCT__
but no matter where thei work __PUNCT__ no matter how time were tough __PUNCT__ thei alwai had faith that there wa someth differ about thi countri __PUNCT__ that in thi countri __PUNCT__ you have some god __PUNCT__ given right __PUNCT__ a life in liberti and the pursuit of happi and a belief that all of us ar equal __PUNCT__ and that we not guarante success __PUNCT__ but we guarante the right to work hard for success __PUNCT__
thei understood that __PUNCT__ and thei understood that succeed in america wasn't about how much monei wa in your bank account __PUNCT__ but it wa about whether you were do right by your peopl __PUNCT__ do right by your famili __PUNCT__ do right by your neighborhood __PUNCT__ do right by your commun __PUNCT__ do right by your countri __PUNCT__ live out our valu __PUNCT__ live out our dream __PUNCT__ live out our hope __PUNCT__
that what america wa about __PUNCT__
and so when i look out at thi crowd __PUNCT__ you inspir me __PUNCT__
and i have to tell you that the privileg of be your presid is someth that i thank god for everi singl dai __PUNCT__
i said to you back in __NUM__ when i wa run __PUNCT__ i not a perfect man __PUNCT__ you can ask michel about that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i told you i wouldn't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but what i did sai to you wa that i alwai tell you what i thought and i alwai tell you where i stood and that i would wake up everi singl morn think about you and fight as hard as i knew how to make your life a littl bit better __PUNCT__
and over these last 3Â½ year __PUNCT__ i know time have been tough __PUNCT__ and i know chang hasn't alwai come as fast as you like __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ i kept that promis __PUNCT__
