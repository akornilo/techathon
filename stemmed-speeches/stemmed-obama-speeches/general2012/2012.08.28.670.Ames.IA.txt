that good for job __PUNCT__
it good for the economi __PUNCT__
it good for the environ __PUNCT__
that the direct we need to go in __PUNCT__
but it all up to you __PUNCT__
it up to you whether we go back to a health care system that let insur compani decid who to cover and when __PUNCT__
i think you __PUNCT__ it might make sens for you to choos to keep move forward with the new health care law that alreadi cut cost and cover more peopl and save live __PUNCT__
governor romnei promis that sometim between take the oval offic and go to the inaugur ball __PUNCT__ he sit right down __PUNCT__ grab a pen __PUNCT__ and kick __NUM__ million young peopl off their parent plan by repeal health reform __PUNCT__
dai on __PUNCT__ that what he sai he go to do __PUNCT__

now is not the time to refight the battl of the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
now is the time for us to go ahead and move forward __PUNCT__
and i work with anybodi who want to make our health care system better __PUNCT__ but i not go to stand by and let folk talk about how we should go back to the dai when ordinari folk who ar work realli hard suddenli find themselv lose their home __PUNCT__ lose their save just becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
thei can choos to refight the battl that were settl __NUM__ year ago or __NUM__ year ago or sometim in the last centuri __PUNCT__
i think women should be trust to make their own health care decis __PUNCT__
that a choic that you got to make __PUNCT__
i think that student who ar brought here by their parent as babi shouldn't be kick out of the onli countri thei know just becaus their parent were undocu worker __PUNCT__
that my view __PUNCT__
it your choic __PUNCT__
i don't think we should write __PUNCT__ rewrit the constitut to prevent gai american from be abl to marri the person thei love __PUNCT__
that my view __PUNCT__
it your choic __PUNCT__
the strength of our charact doesn't come from shove anybodi to the sidelin __PUNCT__
it come from hear everi voic __PUNCT__ har everi talent __PUNCT__ realiz that here in america we ar greater togeth than we ar on our own __PUNCT__

i said we end the iraq war __PUNCT__
we did __PUNCT__
i said we get bin laden __PUNCT__
we did __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ all of our troop ar out of iraq __PUNCT__
we bring them home from afghanistan __PUNCT__
and as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we go to make sure that we serv our veteran as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fight for america should have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
but these ar your choic __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to pass a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut target toward the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
that not go to cut our debt __PUNCT__
ignor inequ doesn't make it go awai __PUNCT__
