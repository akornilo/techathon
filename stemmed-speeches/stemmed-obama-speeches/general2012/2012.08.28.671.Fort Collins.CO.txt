our econom strength doesn't come from the top down __PUNCT__

becaus when thei do well __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
when thei got monei to spend __PUNCT__ busi have custom __PUNCT__
and then thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
and then those worker have more monei to spend __PUNCT__
and everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__ from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__

we shouldn't be make it harder __PUNCT__
we should be make it easier __PUNCT__
we shouldn't end the colleg tax credit that we creat __PUNCT__ we should be expand it __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ a higher educ cannot be a luxuri __PUNCT__ it an econom necess that everi famili and everi young person in america should be abl to afford __PUNCT__
