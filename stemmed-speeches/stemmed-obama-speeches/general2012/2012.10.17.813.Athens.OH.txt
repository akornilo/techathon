and we also invest in the energi sourc of tomorrow __PUNCT__ wind and solar and biofuel __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
todai america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in two decad __PUNCT__
so governor romnei want to revers thi progress __PUNCT__ we want to build on it __PUNCT__
instead of give __PUNCT__ we give __MONEY__ billion a year to oil compani __PUNCT__ corpor welfar __PUNCT__
you pai for it __PUNCT__
thei alreadi make monei everi time you go to the pump __PUNCT__
so i sai let take that monei __PUNCT__ i don't want china to win the race for new technolog and new energi __PUNCT__
let invest here in the unit state in develop that technolog __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we can __PUNCT__ by do thi __PUNCT__ we can also reduc the problem of carbon pollut and we can still invest in clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
i wa listen to governor romnei yesterdai talk about how he a champion of coal __PUNCT__
when he wa a governor __PUNCT__ stood in front of a coal __PUNCT__ fire plant and said __PUNCT__ thi plant kill peopl __PUNCT__
and now he run around talk like he mr __PUNCT__ coal __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ come on __PUNCT__

you know that not on the level __PUNCT__
doe anybodi actual look at that gui and think __PUNCT__ man __PUNCT__ he realli into coal __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ did you see when he wa do that ad __PUNCT__ he in front of all these miner with hard hat __PUNCT__
found out later __PUNCT__ thei had to come __PUNCT__ boss made them come __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ come on __PUNCT__
got to be on the level if you want to be presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i want to give more american the chanc to learn the skill thei need in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i onli here becaus i got a good educ __PUNCT__
i wasn't born into fame or fortun __PUNCT__ and nobodi wa pick __PUNCT__ boi __PUNCT__ that gui barack obama __PUNCT__ he go to be presid somedai __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i got a great educ __PUNCT__
kid of a __PUNCT__ my mom wa a singl mom __PUNCT__ she work her wai through school try to rais me and my sister __PUNCT__
but in america __PUNCT__ we give everybodi an opportun __PUNCT__
that what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
and i never forgotten that __PUNCT__
so on of the first thing we did wa to make sure let stop give bank and lender billion of dollar as middlemen for the student loan program __PUNCT__
let cut out the middlemen and give the monei directli to student __PUNCT__
that how we kept your student loan interest rate low __PUNCT__
that how we expand pell grant __PUNCT__
that why we set up a system where student __PUNCT__ if thei have debt __PUNCT__ thei never go to have to pai more than __NUM__ percent of their incom __PUNCT__
if thei choos to becom a teacher or do someth that doesn't pai a lot of monei __PUNCT__ thei can still manag the debt from get an outstand educ __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
governor romnei __PUNCT__ he sai hire more teacher __PUNCT__ that doesn't help the economi grow __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ he wrong __PUNCT__
it will __PUNCT__
and think about all those kid right now who ar in overcrowd classroom or don't have a comput scienc lab __PUNCT__ thei onli go to be in third grade onc or junior in high school onc __PUNCT__
if thei miss those opportun now __PUNCT__ thei mai not make it up later __PUNCT__
so we could __PUNCT__ you can take governor romnei advic and give a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut and pai for it by cut educ or __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
or we can recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ put them to work right now __PUNCT__
that where the job ar of the futur __PUNCT__
it should be a nation mission to make sure that all our young peopl ar get an educ in some of these field where we know there ar go to be job __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we want our son in that __PUNCT__ but we also want our daughter __PUNCT__
i don't know if you were listen last night __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ we don't have to order up some binder __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ to find qualifi __PUNCT__ talent __PUNCT__ driven young women to learn and teach and thrive and start busi __PUNCT__
and when these young women graduat __PUNCT__ we should make a veri simpl concept the rule __PUNCT__ equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
i got two daughter __PUNCT__
i don't want them paid less than a man for do the same job __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ men out there __PUNCT__ you don't want your wive paid less than a man for the same job __PUNCT__
so thi isn't just a women issu __PUNCT__
thi is a famili issu __PUNCT__
thi is a middl class issu __PUNCT__
governor romnei __PUNCT__ for month __PUNCT__ refus to sai if he support the law that we sign that said equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
just todai hi campaign admit __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he never weigh in on that __PUNCT__
why not __PUNCT__ what so hard about weigh in on that __PUNCT__ do you believ in equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__ or you don't __PUNCT__ i weigh in on it __PUNCT__ becaus that wa the first bill that i sign __PUNCT__ the lilli ledbett fair pai act __PUNCT__ to make it easier for women to enforc their right to get equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__
i want to take some of the monei that we ar save from end the war in iraq and transit in afghanistan to pai down our deficit and put our folk to work right here do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__ build road and bridg and school __PUNCT__
the next debat on mondai is go to be about foreign polici __PUNCT__
it will be interest to hear what governor romnei ha to sai __PUNCT__
he said he thought it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ the wai we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ doubl down on thi __PUNCT__ said we should still have troop in iraq __PUNCT__
just said thi a coupl week ago __PUNCT__
i think that wa a mistak __PUNCT__
i think bring our troop home __PUNCT__ after all the sacrific thei made in a distant countri __PUNCT__ all the sacrific their famili have made __PUNCT__ it is time to make sure that we do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__
and when our troop do come home and take off those uniform __PUNCT__ thei need to know as long as i your command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari in the world and we will also make sure those troop get serv as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
nobodi who fought for thi countri should ever have to fight for a job __PUNCT__ or a roof over their head __PUNCT__ or the health care thei earn when thei come home __PUNCT__
that shouldn't happen __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that shouldn't happen __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ we need to cut the deficit and the debt __PUNCT__
i know you __PUNCT__ the other side __PUNCT__ thei put up a lot of ad __PUNCT__
thei think that you forgotten the fact that thei fought two war on a credit card and two tax cut on a credit card and didn't pai for anyth __PUNCT__ said deficit didn't matter __PUNCT__
thei like the gui who show up at a restaur __PUNCT__ order a big steak __PUNCT__ ha a big drink __PUNCT__ order a big piec of pie __PUNCT__ then leav befor pai the tab __PUNCT__
and then thei sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ look at what obama did __PUNCT__
it like __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you all had noth to do with it __PUNCT__
but look __PUNCT__ we got to do someth about it __PUNCT__
so what i said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i alreadi work with republican and democrat to cut a trillion dollar in spend __PUNCT__
i readi to do more __PUNCT__
but we can't get it done just by cut educ program or cut basic research program that help us grow our economi __PUNCT__
so what i said is if we do some cut __PUNCT__ let also make sure the wealthiest household pai a littl bit more __PUNCT__ pai higher tax after your first __MONEY__ worth of incom __PUNCT__ go back to the rate bill clinton had when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ when we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__
governor romnei ha some differ idea __PUNCT__
he wa ask on __PUNCT__ __NUM__ minut __PUNCT__ some of you mai have seen thi __PUNCT__ is it fair for you __PUNCT__ make __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ to pai a lower tax rate than a teacher make __MONEY__ audienc member __PUNCT__

and i not go to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home __PUNCT__ or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to pai for that tax cut by make all the student here pai more for colleg or kick kid off of head start or elimin health insur for million of american who ar elderli or poor or disabl __PUNCT__
i not go to turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__
