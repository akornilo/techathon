i want to stop give tax break to compani that reward __PUNCT__ tax break that reward compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
reward compani that ar invest here in america __PUNCT__ in the next gener of manufactur __PUNCT__
that how we grow an economi __PUNCT__
that how we creat job __PUNCT__
that what i see for colorado __PUNCT__
that what i see for our futur __PUNCT__
chang __PUNCT__ real chang __PUNCT__ is turn the page on a decad of war so we can do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ we will pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
but it time to us the save from end two war to pai down our debt __PUNCT__ rebuild america __PUNCT__ repair road and bridg __PUNCT__ make sure our school ar state of the art __PUNCT__ put peopl back to work right now __PUNCT__ especi our veteran __PUNCT__ becaus anybodi who ha fought for our freedom should not have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that thei need or the benefit thei earn when thei come home __PUNCT__

and chang is a futur where we reduc our deficit in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
i sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend cut __PUNCT__ i intend to do more __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ we can't just cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
there ar some thing we need to do to make sure we grow and put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ and that mean we got to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the tax rate thei paid when bill clinton wa in offic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason is becaus budget ar prioriti __PUNCT__ thei reflect our valu __PUNCT__
i not go to kick a kid off of head start so i can get a tax break __PUNCT__
i don't need it __PUNCT__
as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i will not turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
that not true to who we ar __PUNCT__ and that not how we grow an economi __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ colorado __PUNCT__ we know what real chang is __PUNCT__

i ran becaus the voic of the american peopl __PUNCT__ your voic __PUNCT__ had been shut out of our democraci for wai too long __PUNCT__ by the lobbyist and the special interest __PUNCT__ the politician who will sai anyth and do anyth just to keep thing the wai thei ar __PUNCT__ the protector of the statu quo __PUNCT__
the statu quo in washington is fierc __PUNCT__ and it ha fought us everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
thei spent million of dollar to try to stop us from reform health care __PUNCT__ million of dollar try to stop us from reform wall street __PUNCT__
thei engin a strategi of gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis even on idea that __PUNCT__ in the past __PUNCT__ both democrat and republican agre on __PUNCT__
that why we got republican oppos to a health care plan that start as a republican idea __PUNCT__ implement by a republican governor __PUNCT__
and what thei count on now is that you go to be so worn down by all the squabbl __PUNCT__ so tire of all the dysfunct __PUNCT__ just fed up __PUNCT__ that you give up and you walk awai and you leav thing the wai thei ar and you put back those folk who have been protect the statu quo all these year back into power __PUNCT__
