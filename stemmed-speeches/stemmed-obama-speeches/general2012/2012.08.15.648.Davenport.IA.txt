we got unfinish busi to attend to __PUNCT__
i come here to ask you to stand with me and help me finish the job __PUNCT__
i ask you to help finish what we start __PUNCT__ to bring about the chang that is go to make america live up to it promis __PUNCT__ not just for thi gener __PUNCT__ but for gener to come __PUNCT__
that is why i am run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
three month __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ less than __NUM__ month from now __PUNCT__ less than __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ not that i count __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you will face a choic __PUNCT__
and that choic could not be bigger __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it a choic that you face thi __DATE__ that is not just about two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__ it a choic between two fundament differ vision of where to take america __PUNCT__
and the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth is not go to have a direct __PUNCT__ not just go to have a direct impact on your live __PUNCT__ it go to have an impact on your kid __PUNCT__ live and your grandchildren live __PUNCT__
when we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ some republican __PUNCT__ we came togeth to restor that basic bargain that built thi countri __PUNCT__
michel talk about it __PUNCT__
simpl idea __PUNCT__ here in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you work hard you can get ahead __PUNCT__
here in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you take respons and you put in the effort __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a job that support a famili __PUNCT__ you should be abl to find a home you can call your own __PUNCT__ you shouldn't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ you should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and most of all __PUNCT__ you should be abl to give your kid the kind of educ and opportun that allow them to dream even bigger and do even better than we ever did __PUNCT__
that is the basic american promis __PUNCT__ and that promis wa be broken __PUNCT__
we seen a decad where job were be ship oversea and where wage and incom were go down __PUNCT__ except for a few at the veri top __PUNCT__ even while the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were skyrocket __PUNCT__
we saw two war fought on a credit card __PUNCT__ surplu go into deficit __PUNCT__ all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
so we knew that restor that basic american idea that if you work hard you can get ahead __PUNCT__ that it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__ that it wa go to take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
and that wa all befor we saw how badli thi financi crisi hammer middl class famili __PUNCT__ folk lose their home and lose their job __PUNCT__ lose their save __PUNCT__ all push that american dream a littl further out of reach __PUNCT__
and i told you in __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ don't look for quick fix __PUNCT__
we didn't get into thi overnight __PUNCT__ we not go to solv it overnight __PUNCT__
but what i said __PUNCT__ and what is still true __PUNCT__ is we got all the thing we need __PUNCT__ all the ingredi __PUNCT__
we got the capac to meet our challeng __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best farmer in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best small __PUNCT__ businesspeopl in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research and colleg and univers in the world __PUNCT__
we a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__
peopl want to come here from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
no matter what the naysay mai sai __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that would not trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
peopl around the world understand thi is still a place where no matter what you look like or where you come from or what your last name is __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
and that the idea we try to rebuild __PUNCT__
that why we __PUNCT__ that what thi campaign about __PUNCT__
that what the last 3½ year have been about __PUNCT__
everi dai __PUNCT__ i woken up think about you __PUNCT__
that what we thought about when we put in place the recoveri act to help make sure that everybodi who need it got a tax cut __PUNCT__ to make sure that teacher could stai on the job and firefight and cop __PUNCT__
that what i wa think about when we save the auto industri that wa about to go under __PUNCT__
that how we work with busi to help creat 4½ million new job __PUNCT__ half a million in manufactur __PUNCT__
but we got a long wai to go __PUNCT__
we got more work to do __PUNCT__
we know that __PUNCT__
and the big challeng we have right now is not a lack of big idea __PUNCT__ it not a lack of solut __PUNCT__
our problem is polit in washington __PUNCT__
we got folk on the other side who think __PUNCT__ compromis __PUNCT__ is a dirti word and basic have onli two idea to grow the economi __PUNCT__
on is to get rid of regul that we put in place to make sure that we don't have anoth tax __PUNCT__ fund bailout __PUNCT__ taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout when the bank make reckless decis or make sure that pollut aren't pollut or make sure insur compani aren't take advantag of you __PUNCT__
so thei want to strip awai those regul __PUNCT__
and the other big idea thei got is the same kind of top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
governor romnei big idea is a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of which would be go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ who alreadi been do veri well __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
romnei hood __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
romnei hood __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and here the kicker __PUNCT__ he expect you to pai for it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
becaus __MONEY__ trillion is a lot of monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ time our defens budget __PUNCT__ so that would be the equival of our defens budget in tax cut everi singl year __PUNCT__
and hi basic idea is that middl class famili with children would see their tax bill go up an averag __MONEY__
thi is not my analysi __PUNCT__
thi is an analysi that wa done by independ economist __PUNCT__
and thei ask you to pai more in your tax not to reduc the deficit or grow job or invest in educ __PUNCT__ but to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to peopl make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ hi alli in congress have the same view __PUNCT__
you heard that he announc congressman ryan as hi run mate __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ congressman ryan __PUNCT__ i know him __PUNCT__ he a good man __PUNCT__ a famili man __PUNCT__
but he is the ideolog leader of thi republican congress __PUNCT__
and he a veri articul spokesperson for governor romnei vision __PUNCT__
the problem is the vision wrong __PUNCT__
we don't agre with it __PUNCT__
thei have tri to sell us thi top __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ trickl __PUNCT__ down econom befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we just tri it right befor i took offic __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ it did not work __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ and it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ secretli __PUNCT__ i think thei know thi __PUNCT__
thei understand their econom plan isn't veri popular __PUNCT__ becaus thei start make all kind of stuff up about my plan __PUNCT__
i give you an exampl __PUNCT__
late __PUNCT__ thei been talk about medicar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind these ar __PUNCT__ both governor romnei and congressman ryan in the past have said thei want to voucher the medicar system __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no wai __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
here what i done __PUNCT__
i strengthen medicar __PUNCT__
i made reform that save million of senior with medicar hundr of dollar on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
we close the doughnut hole __PUNCT__
i propos reform that will save medicar monei by get rid of wast spend in the health care system __PUNCT__ reform that will not touch your medicar benefit __PUNCT__
and governor romnei and hi run mate have a differ plan __PUNCT__
thei want to turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__
that mean senior would no longer have the guarante of medicar __PUNCT__ thei get a voucher to bui privat insur __PUNCT__
and if it doesn't keep up with cost __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the senior __PUNCT__ problem __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
it wa estim that governor romnei run mate __PUNCT__ hi origin plan would forc senior to pai an extra __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
my plan extend medicar by nearli a decad __PUNCT__
their plan end medicar as we know it __PUNCT__
my plan reduc the cost of medicar by crack down on fraud and wast and subsidi to insur compani __PUNCT__
their plan make senior pai more to help financ anoth tax cut for folk who don't need it __PUNCT__
that an exampl of the differ between our two philosophi __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that is why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when it come to tax __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__ i did it __PUNCT__
if anybodi tell you democrat ar all big tax __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ spend __PUNCT__ you tell them __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ my tax ar lower than thei were befor presid obama took offic by about __MONEY__ for a typic famili __PUNCT__
so now i want to keep tax right where thei ar for the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of american and __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still keep the tax cut on the first __MONEY__ you make __PUNCT__
but if you make more than that __PUNCT__ we go to ask you to contribut just a littl bit more to help pai down the deficit and allow us to still invest in thing like educ that help the economi grow __PUNCT__
that won't solv the whole deficit problem __PUNCT__
we still got to make some smart cut __PUNCT__
i alreadi cut a trillion dollar of spend __PUNCT__
we can do more __PUNCT__
but we can't just balanc our budget on the back of middl class famili __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ not just on the back of the poor __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i know folk like me ar in a posit to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__ go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__ a time when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ we had a budget surplu instead of a deficit __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ millionair did good too __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ busi and corpor did well too __PUNCT__
and here the reason __PUNCT__ when a teacher or a firefight or a receptionist or a construct worker __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl more monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ when you got a littl more monei __PUNCT__ pocket __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you spend it __PUNCT__ becaus time ar tough __PUNCT__
you mayb haven't bought a new car in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
mayb you got an old broken applianc that just been sit there __PUNCT__ doesn't work __PUNCT__
mayb your kid is go to colleg and you want to make sure thei got a comput to help them with their studi __PUNCT__
so you go out __PUNCT__ and now busi have more custom __PUNCT__
and when busi have more custom __PUNCT__ thei make more profit __PUNCT__
and when thei make more profit __PUNCT__ thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
and then those worker have a littl more monei __PUNCT__ and thei go out and spend some more __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ when you look at the histori of thi countri __PUNCT__ we didn't grow through top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__ we grew through middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__
we grew from bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
we grew togeth __PUNCT__ where everybodi got a fair shot and everybodi do their fair share and everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so on almost everi issu __PUNCT__ you go to have a choic __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ that a million worker at stake __PUNCT__ and i believ in american worker __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
so now i want to make sure american manufactur take root here __PUNCT__
let chang thi tax code onc and for all __PUNCT__ stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ let give them to compani that ar invest here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to keep those tax break __PUNCT__
he like to talk about hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__ but a lot of it wa invest in compani that have been call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
we don't need more outsourc __PUNCT__ we need more insourc __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want to make sure we got the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that local school district can hire more teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that __NUM__ million more peopl can go to commun colleg so thei can get train for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to keep push on colleg and univers to lower tuition so everi young person can afford to get a higher educ __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
governor romnei want to end the tax credit for wind energi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
wind energi creat __NUM__ job in iowa __PUNCT__ __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
governor romnei said these new sourc of energi ar __PUNCT__ imaginari __PUNCT__
congressman ryan said thei a __PUNCT__ fad __PUNCT__
those __NUM__ job aren't a fad __PUNCT__ thei our futur __PUNCT__
we should stop give __MONEY__ billion a year in taxpay subsidi to the big oil compani that ar alreadi make monei and help creat homegrown sourc of energi that put american back to work and help free ourselv from depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i said we refocu attent on al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
we set a timelin to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
all thi wa possibl becaus of incred men and women in uniform like amanda __PUNCT__
so now we got an oblig to make sure that our va and all our servic ar do what we need to do for our veteran now that thei come home __PUNCT__
but part of that is also take some of the save after a decad of war and us them to put folk back to work do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let rebuild some road and some bridg __PUNCT__
let creat a veteran job corp so thei can get job as firefight and cop in commun that need them __PUNCT__
that the america i want to build __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and let me just tell you on more choic __PUNCT__
governor romnei said on of the first thing he go to do on dai on is he go to kill obamacar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to sai __PUNCT__ i grown kind of fond of the term obamacar __PUNCT__
becaus i do care __PUNCT__
i care about all the famili in iowa and illinoi and all across the countri that i met who had preexist condit and now thei know thei go to be abl to get health care coverag __PUNCT__
i care about 6½ million young peopl who can now stai on their parent plan becaus of obamacar __PUNCT__
i care about the senior who ar get discount on their prescript drug becaus of obamacar __PUNCT__
so mayb governor romnei want to have anoth __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ worth of argument about health care __PUNCT__
i want to move forward __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar implement it __PUNCT__
it is help famili all across thi nation __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__ not backward __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
so on all these issu __PUNCT__ whether it health care secur __PUNCT__ make sure medicar is there for futur gener __PUNCT__ make sure that we rebuild america __PUNCT__ make sure our kid ar get the best educ possibl __PUNCT__ these ar all ingredi of what we know to be a middl class life __PUNCT__
it what michel talk about __PUNCT__
it what help michel and me have the opportun to do thing that our parent could not have imagin __PUNCT__
and now we want to make sure the next gener ha it __PUNCT__
and i know you gui feel the same wai becaus you got that same stori __PUNCT__
your parent __PUNCT__ your grandpar __PUNCT__ your great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ the struggl thei went through to give us a shot __PUNCT__
we got an oblig now to make sure our children have that same shot __PUNCT__ that same opportun __PUNCT__
that why thi elect so import __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month the other side will spend more monei than we have ever seen on ad tell you on thing __PUNCT__ that the economi is not so good and it obama fault __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ their econom theori doesn't sell __PUNCT__ so that go to be their messag __PUNCT__
and it mai be a plan to win the elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to creat job or reduc the deficit or grow the economi __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__ but i do __PUNCT__
