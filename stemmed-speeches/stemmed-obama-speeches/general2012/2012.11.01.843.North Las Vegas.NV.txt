on the on hand __PUNCT__ we got folk who ar argu to return to the top __PUNCT__ down polici that crash our economi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
what we talk about is a futur that built on a strong and grow middl class __PUNCT__
nevada __PUNCT__ we know the choic that need to be made __PUNCT__ and we here todai becaus we believ that if thi countri invest in the skill and idea of it peopl __PUNCT__ then good job and busi will follow __PUNCT__
we believ that america free market ha been the engin of america progress __PUNCT__ driven by risk taker and innov and dreamer __PUNCT__
folk in nevada know about dream __PUNCT__
but we also understand that in thi countri __PUNCT__ peopl succe when thei got a shot at a good educ __PUNCT__ when thei have a chanc to learn new skill __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ busi benefit becaus thei hire those worker __PUNCT__ and some of those worker end up start busi of their own __PUNCT__

we believ we grow faster when our tax code reward hard work and compani that creat job here in america __PUNCT__
and we believ that qualiti health care for everybodi and a dignifi retir for everybodi aren't just achiev goal __PUNCT__ thei ar a measur of our valu as a nation __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we had a presid who share these belief __PUNCT__
hi name wa bill clinton __PUNCT__
and when he wa elect __PUNCT__ he ask the wealthiest american to pai a littl more so we could reduc the deficit and still make invest in thing like educ and train and scienc and research __PUNCT__
and here an interest thing __PUNCT__ plenti of folk who were run for congress at the time said it would hurt the economi __PUNCT__ that rais tax on the wealthi would kill job __PUNCT__
and if that argument sound familiar __PUNCT__ on of those candid who wa run back then happen to be the gui who is run for presid right now __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__

incom were up __PUNCT__
poverti wa down __PUNCT__
our deficit becam the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ we know our idea work __PUNCT__
we also know the idea that don't work __PUNCT__
becaus in the __NUM__ year after bill clinton left offic __PUNCT__ hi polici were revers __PUNCT__
the wealthiest american got tax cut thei didn't need and we couldn't afford __PUNCT__
compani enjoi tax break for ship job oversea __PUNCT__
insur compani and oil compani and wall street were given free licens to do whatev thei pleas __PUNCT__
folk at the top got to plai by a differ set of rule than the rest of us __PUNCT__
and the result of thi top __PUNCT__ down econom wa fall incom __PUNCT__ record deficit __PUNCT__ the slowest job growth in half a centuri __PUNCT__ and an econom crisi that we still clean up after __PUNCT__
so in the close week of thi campaign __PUNCT__ governor romnei ha been us all hi talent as a salesman to dress up the veri same polici that fail our countri so badli __PUNCT__ the veri same polici we been clean up after over these __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and with a straight face __PUNCT__ he offer them up as chang __PUNCT__

and govern can't do thi alon __PUNCT__ parent have to parent __PUNCT__ teacher have to teach __PUNCT__
but don't tell me that hire more teacher won't help thi economi grow or help young peopl compet __PUNCT__
we know that it will __PUNCT__
don't tell me that student who can't afford colleg should just borrow monei from their parent __PUNCT__
that wasn't an option for me __PUNCT__
i bet it wasn't an option for a whole lot of you __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be end colleg tax credit just to pai for a millionair tax cut __PUNCT__ we should be make colleg more afford for everybodi who will to work for it __PUNCT__
we should recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher so that high __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage job aren't creat in china __PUNCT__ thei creat right here in nevada __PUNCT__
we should work with our commun colleg to train anoth __NUM__ million american with the skill that busi ar look for right now __PUNCT__
that my plan for the futur __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
that the america we fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang come when we live up to our legaci of innov __PUNCT__ when we make america home to the next gener of outstand manufactur __PUNCT__ scientif discoveri __PUNCT__ technolog breakthrough __PUNCT__
i am proud that i bet on american worker and american ingenu and the american auto industri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we not just build car again __PUNCT__ we build better car __PUNCT__ car that by the middl of the next decad will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar thousand of worker build long __PUNCT__ last batteri and wind turbin __PUNCT__ instal solar panel all across the countri __PUNCT__
and those job __PUNCT__ thei weren't there __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
and sure __PUNCT__ not all technolog we bet on will pan out __PUNCT__
some of the busi we encourag will fail __PUNCT__
but i promis you thi __PUNCT__ there is a futur for manufactur in america __PUNCT__
there a futur for clean energi in america __PUNCT__
i refus to cede that futur to other countri __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that reward compani for creat job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to reward compani that creat job right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that subsid oil compani profit when thei alreadi make monei hand over fist __PUNCT__ i want to support the energi job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ the new technolog that will cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__
that my plan for job and growth __PUNCT__
that the futur that i see for america __PUNCT__
chang is final turn the page on a decad of war to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
we will not let up __PUNCT__
but it time to us the save from end the war in iraq and afghanistan to start pai down our debt and rebuild america __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we could be put more folk back to work right now __PUNCT__ fix road and bridg __PUNCT__ expand broadband to rural neighborhood __PUNCT__ make sure our school ar state of the art __PUNCT__
let put american back to work do the work that need to be done __PUNCT__ especi our veteran __PUNCT__ becaus no on who fight for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that my commit to you __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
chang is a futur where __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but we do it in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
i alreadi sign a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend cut __PUNCT__
i work with both parti to streamlin agenc and get rid of program that don't work __PUNCT__
but if we realli seriou about the deficit __PUNCT__ then we also got to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the tax rate thei plai __PUNCT__ thei paid when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
becaus as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i am not go to turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i won't allow thi nation to be plung into anoth battl over health care reform just so insur compani can jump back in the driver seat __PUNCT__
and i will never allow politician in washington to control the health care choic that women should make for themselv __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ we know what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__
we don't need a big govern agenda __PUNCT__ or a small govern agenda __PUNCT__ we need a middl class agenda that reward the valu of hard work and respons __PUNCT__
we don't need a partisan agenda __PUNCT__ we need a common __PUNCT__ sens agenda that sai when we educ a poor child __PUNCT__ we all be better off __PUNCT__ that sai when we fund the research of a young scientist __PUNCT__ her new discoveri will benefit everi american __PUNCT__
we need a vision that sai we don't just look out for ourselv __PUNCT__ we look out for on anoth __PUNCT__

the protector of the statu quo ar a power forc in washington __PUNCT__

thei spent million to stop us from reform health care __PUNCT__ spent million to fight us when we tri to reform wall street __PUNCT__
their strategi from the start wa to engin pure gridlock __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that both democrat and republican had support in the past __PUNCT__
