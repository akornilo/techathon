i promis to cut tax for small busi owner __PUNCT__ and we have __PUNCT__ __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
we got everi dime back that wa us to rescu the bank __PUNCT__
we pass a law to end taxpay __PUNCT__ fund wall street bailout for good __PUNCT__
we pass health care reform __PUNCT__ also known as obamacar __PUNCT__ becaus i do care about the american peopl __PUNCT__
so your insur compani can't jerk you around anymor __PUNCT__ or tell you that be a women is somehow a preexist condit __PUNCT__
we repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ so no outstand soldier is ever kick out of the militari becaus of who thei love __PUNCT__
when governor romnei tri to give us hi busi advic about the economi and said that we should __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thank __PUNCT__ we not go to take that advic __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
so __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year after that campaign that you were watch on that video __PUNCT__ after the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ our busi have now creat more than __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__
on fridai __PUNCT__ we found out the unemploy rate ha fallen from the height of __NUM__ percent down to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ the lowest sinc i took offic __PUNCT__
manufactur is come back to america __PUNCT__
home valu ar on the rise __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we not there yet __PUNCT__
we still got too mani american look for work __PUNCT__ too mani famili who can't pai the bill __PUNCT__ too mani home underwat __PUNCT__ too mani young peopl graduat with too much debt __PUNCT__
but if there on thing i know __PUNCT__ we come a long wai __PUNCT__ and we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
the last thing we can afford right now is __NUM__ year of the veri same polici that led us to thi crisi in the first place __PUNCT__
i cannot allow that to happen __PUNCT__
i will not let it happen __PUNCT__
that why i am run for a second term for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ and that why i need your help __PUNCT__
i have seen too much pain and too much struggl to let thi countri go through anoth round of top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
on of the main reason we had thi crisi in the first place is becaus we had big bank on wall street that were allow to make big bet with other peopl monei on the line __PUNCT__
and now governor romnei want to roll back the rule so we go back to that behavior __PUNCT__ not if i have anyth to sai about it __PUNCT__
on of the main reason we went from record surplus under bill clinton to record deficit under georg bush is becaus we put two war and two tax cut on a credit card __PUNCT__
and now governor romnei want anoth __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut that he can't pai for __PUNCT__ not if i got anyth to sai about it __PUNCT__
obvious __PUNCT__ the governor know hi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut isn't too popular __PUNCT__ so a few week befor thi elect __PUNCT__ he try to pretend it doesn't exist __PUNCT__ becaus that a lot easier than try to explain how he pai for it without ask middl class famili to pick up the tab __PUNCT__
the other night he rule out ask millionair and billionair to pai even a dime more in tax to help us bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
not a dime __PUNCT__
when he wa ask what he actual do to cut spend __PUNCT__ he said he go after public televis __PUNCT__
so for all you mom and kid out there __PUNCT__ don't worri __PUNCT__ somebodi is final crack down on big bird __PUNCT__ crack down on him __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ elmo ha made a run for the border __PUNCT__
governor romnei plan to let wall street run wild again __PUNCT__ but he bring the hammer down on sesam street __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ l.a __PUNCT__ we can't afford anoth round of tax cut for folk who don't need them __PUNCT__
we can't afford to gut our invest in educ or clean energi or research and technolog __PUNCT__
we can't afford to roll back regul not just on wall street __PUNCT__ but on oil compani and insur compani __PUNCT__
that not a job plan __PUNCT__
that not a plan to grow our economi __PUNCT__
that not chang __PUNCT__
it a relaps __PUNCT__
we been there __PUNCT__
we have tri that __PUNCT__
we not go back __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
that why i run again __PUNCT__
that why i need your help __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ we got a differ view about how we creat job and prosper in america __PUNCT__
thi countri doesn't succe when onli the top ar do well __PUNCT__
we succe when the middl class is get bigger and peopl have ladder of opportun to live out their dream __PUNCT__
our economi doesn't grow from the top down __PUNCT__ it grow from the middl out and the bottom up __PUNCT__
we don't believ that anybodi is entitl to success in thi countri __PUNCT__
but we do believ in someth call opportun __PUNCT__
we believ in a countri where hard work pai off and respons is reward and everybodi is get a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
that the countri that i believ in __PUNCT__
that the countri you believ in __PUNCT__
that what i been fight for __PUNCT__ for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
we got a lot more work to do to make sure that everybodi is take part __PUNCT__
so here what we need to do __PUNCT__
we done a lot __PUNCT__
we got a lot more to do __PUNCT__
i think it time to chang our tax code so we not reward job __PUNCT__ compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to reward small busi and manufactur who make product that ar stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
i want us to control our own energi here in america __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__ and that mean someth here in lo angel __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
so now it time to move forward __PUNCT__
my plan would cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__ by invest in the clean energi that creat thousand of job all across america right now __PUNCT__ not just oil and natur ga __PUNCT__ but wind power and solar and fuel __PUNCT__ effici car and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
and unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to allow oil compani to collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in taxpay __PUNCT__ fund corpor welfar __PUNCT__
we not go to let china win the race for clean energi technolog __PUNCT__
i want that technolog develop right here in the unit state __PUNCT__ creat job right here in the unit state __PUNCT__ help our environ right here in the unit state __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
i want us to have the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__ make sure that american from everi walk of life ar get the chanc thei need to get the skill thei need to succe __PUNCT__
i would not be stand here if it weren't for an educ that i couldn't necessarili afford on my own __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__ for michel __PUNCT__ for so mani of you __PUNCT__
and now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we could gut educ to pai for governor romnei __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion tax break __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
or we can recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ improv our earli __PUNCT__ childhood educ system __PUNCT__ provid job train for __NUM__ million worker at our commun colleg __PUNCT__ work with colleg and univers to cut the growth of tuition cost __PUNCT__
we can meet those goal __PUNCT__
we can make sure that everi young person here in lo angel __PUNCT__ here in california __PUNCT__ here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no matter what thei look like __PUNCT__ no matter where thei come from __PUNCT__ if thei will to work hard __PUNCT__ thei can succe too __PUNCT__
that our goal __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
we us the monei we save from end the war in iraq and afghanistan to pai down our deficit __PUNCT__ but also to put peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and school all across america __PUNCT__
and everi brave american who wear the uniform of thi countri should know that as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who ha fought for thi countri should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
let not just talk about honor our veteran __PUNCT__ let put our monei where our mouth is __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ we need to cut the deficit __PUNCT__ but we got to do it in an intellig wai __PUNCT__
i propos cut it by __MONEY__ trillion over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and i alreadi work with republican to cut a trillion dollar of spend __PUNCT__
but we can't get thi done unless we also look at the other side of the ledger __PUNCT__
we don't cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
we got to ask the wealthiest among us to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__ which is the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and a lot of millionair did well too __PUNCT__
becaus when we give tax break to middl __PUNCT__ incom folk __PUNCT__ to lower incom folk __PUNCT__ thei spend it __PUNCT__
thei need to to pai the bill __PUNCT__ which mean busi end up with more custom __PUNCT__ thei make more profit __PUNCT__ and that mean thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
governor romnei said it fair that he pai a lower tax rate than a teacher or an autowork that make __MONEY__
i think he wrong __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl just to pai for tax cut we can't afford __PUNCT__
and that the choic that we face in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
over and over again __PUNCT__ we told that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if a compani releas pollut into the air your children breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to start a busi or go to colleg __PUNCT__ just borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ we believ in individu initi and self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__ but we also believ there ar some thing we do togeth __PUNCT__
we understand america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__
it about what can be done by us togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
you understood that in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it true even more so now in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
becaus of you __PUNCT__ we made progress __PUNCT__
you the reason there a littl girl with a heart disord in phoenix who get the surgeri she need becaus insur compani can't limit her coverag __PUNCT__
you the reason a factori worker who lost hi job in toledo is back on the line build the best car in the world __PUNCT__
you the reason a student here in l.a __PUNCT__ ha help pai for her colleg __PUNCT__
the reason a veteran can go to colleg on the new g.i __PUNCT__ bill __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason that an outstand soldier won't be kick out of the militari becaus of who thei ar or who thei love __PUNCT__
you the reason why thousand of famili have final been abl to sai to love on who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
you the reason __PUNCT__
and if you turn back now __PUNCT__ if you bui into the cynic that everyth that we fought for somehow isn't possibl __PUNCT__ then of cours __PUNCT__ chang won't happen __PUNCT__
if you give up on the idea that your voic can make a differ __PUNCT__ then other voic will fill the void __PUNCT__ the lobbyist and the special interest and the folk who ar write __MONEY__ million check to beat me and folk who ar try to keep __PUNCT__ make it harder for you to vote __PUNCT__ the politician in washington who want to control the health care choic that women ar perfectli capabl of make themselv __PUNCT__
you got to make sure that your voic is heard __PUNCT__
onli you can make sure that those thing don't happen __PUNCT__
onli you got the power to move us forward __PUNCT__
i alwai said __PUNCT__ i said thi back in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ that chang __PUNCT__ real chang __PUNCT__ take time __PUNCT__
it take more than on term or on presid __PUNCT__
it take more than on parti __PUNCT__
it can't happen if you write off half the nation befor you even take offic __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ everybodi alwai rememb the victori __PUNCT__ but thei don't alwai rememb the bump in the road __PUNCT__
thing alwai look good in retrospect __PUNCT__
but in the middl of it __PUNCT__ we were __PUNCT__ we made all kind of mistak __PUNCT__
we goof up __PUNCT__
i goof up __PUNCT__
but the american peopl carri us forward __PUNCT__
and even with all the thing we had go for us __PUNCT__ all the wai that thing just kind of converg __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of the countri still didn't vote for me __PUNCT__
