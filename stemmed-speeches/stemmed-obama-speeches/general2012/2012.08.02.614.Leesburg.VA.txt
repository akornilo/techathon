i don't get that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i can bare do a somersault __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ unbeliev __PUNCT__
so we could not be prouder of gabbi __PUNCT__
we could not be prouder of her teammat __PUNCT__
and we could not be prouder of all our american athlet __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ it a us remind that even when we have these major debat back home __PUNCT__ when we go oversea __PUNCT__ we not democrat __PUNCT__ and we not republican or independ __PUNCT__ we ar american __PUNCT__
that what we about __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ unless you been abl to hide your televis set or your cabl is bust __PUNCT__ you mai know that there is a pretti intens campaign go on right now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the reason that it so intens is becaus so much is at stake __PUNCT__
the choic that we face in __DATE__ could not be bigger __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two parti __PUNCT__
more than ani elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ path for our countri __PUNCT__ two fundament differ vision of where we need to go __PUNCT__
and the direct that we choos __PUNCT__ the direct that all of you will choos when you walk into that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ is go to have a direct impact not just on your live __PUNCT__ it will have an impact on your children live and your grandchildren live __PUNCT__
it will affect us for decad to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ not just as democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ we came togeth becaus we want to restor a basic bargain that made us the countri that we ar __PUNCT__ the core idea that made us the most prosper economi in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
and it a simpl idea __PUNCT__
it a bargain that sai if you work hard __PUNCT__ that work should be reward __PUNCT__
it a deal that sai if you put in enough effort and you act respons __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that pai the bill and you can afford a home that you call your own __PUNCT__ that you can count on health care if you get sick and you can put awai enough monei to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ it an idea that we can give our children the kind of educ that allow them to dream even bigger dream and do even better than we did __PUNCT__
that at the heart of who we ar __PUNCT__
that the american promis __PUNCT__
and let face it __PUNCT__ part of the reason why we had so much energi in the __NUM__ campaign wa becaus we understood that we had seen a decad where that basic bargain wasn't be met __PUNCT__
famili were work harder and harder __PUNCT__ but their incom were actual stagnat __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__
we went from a surplu to a record deficit becaus of tax cut we didn't pai for and becaus of two war that we put on a credit card __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
so we understood that restor that basic american idea __PUNCT__ that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead that is at the heart of the middl class __PUNCT__ the heart of who we ar __PUNCT__ we knew restor that wa not go to be easi and it would take more than on year and it would take more than on term and it would probabl take more than on presid __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the middl class wa hammer by thi crisi that rob too mani of our friend and neighbor of their job and their home and their save and push the american dream even further out of reach for too mani work famili __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we shown we can make progress __PUNCT__
over the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we been abl to creat 4½ million job and half a million job in manufactur __PUNCT__ and we save an auto industri __PUNCT__
the economi is grow __PUNCT__
and we know we got more work to do __PUNCT__ but it given us a sens of what it mean to move forward and not back __PUNCT__
and what also given us confid is there on thing that thi crisi ha not chang __PUNCT__ it hasn't chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang our charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what made us great __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang why we came togeth to do what we did in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it just made our mission more urgent __PUNCT__
we ar here to build an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ where respons is reward so that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you came from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ leesburg __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ like i said __PUNCT__ we still got a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
we love you __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__
but we still got a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
we still got million of peopl out there who ar look for work __PUNCT__
too mani home ar still underwat __PUNCT__
and we recogn there ar no quick fix or easi solut to all the problem we face __PUNCT__
but there is no doubt in my mind that we got the capac to meet these challeng __PUNCT__
think about what we got go for us __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and the best univers in the world __PUNCT__
we a young nation __PUNCT__ with the greatest divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__ loudoun counti is a great exampl of it __PUNCT__
peopl come here from everi corner of the globe look for opportun __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay sai __PUNCT__ no matter how dark the other side tri to paint the situat __PUNCT__ there is not a countri on earth that would not gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so what stand in our wai is not the lack of technic solut __PUNCT__
it not the lack of idea that will help move us forward __PUNCT__
what hold us back right now is polit in washington __PUNCT__
it a stalem __PUNCT__
it a stalem that result from the uncompromis view of __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ thi idea that the onli thing we can do is go back to the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that didn't work and got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ their __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei got a veri simpl set of idea when it come to the economi __PUNCT__
their basic theori is if thei cut tax more for the wealthi __PUNCT__ and if thei get rid of regul __PUNCT__ some of which have been on the book for decad __PUNCT__ some of which we put in place to rein in wall street after thi latest debacl __PUNCT__ some of which we put in to make sure that health insur compani aren't take advantag of you __PUNCT__ some of which we put in place to make sure that credit card compani or financi institut ar treat consum fairli __PUNCT__ the notion is that somehow if we get rid of those regul and we give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ thi will all lead to job and prosper for everybodi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ that is their idea __PUNCT__
that is what thei ar propos __PUNCT__
that where thei will take us if thei win __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of governor romnei entir econom plan is a new __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
thi is on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we known for a while that a lot of thi tax cut would go to the wealthiest __NUM__ percent of all household __PUNCT__
we knew that __PUNCT__
but yesterdai an independ __PUNCT__ nonpartisan organ __PUNCT__ thei dug into the number __PUNCT__
thei did the research __PUNCT__
thei analyz governor romnei plan __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ thi is an organ that head by an economist who us to work for presid bush __PUNCT__ so thi is not some partisan analysi __PUNCT__
thi is a bipartisan __PUNCT__ independ analysi __PUNCT__
so here what thei found __PUNCT__
i want everybodi to pai attent __PUNCT__
thi studi found that folk make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ so thi is the top on __PUNCT__ tenth of __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ would get a tax cut worth almost a quarter of a million dollar __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so thei get a __MONEY__ tax break at least __PUNCT__
some folk would get more __PUNCT__
so the question is __PUNCT__ sinc governor romnei sai he doesn't want to add to the deficit __PUNCT__ he think thi is a moral challeng __PUNCT__ we got to bring down the deficit __PUNCT__ who get the bill for these __MONEY__ tax cut for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we do __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thi is a smart crowd __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you do __PUNCT__
thi analysi found that if governor romnei want to keep hi promis and pai for hi plan so that it doesn't increas the deficit even more __PUNCT__ then a middl class famili with children will be hit with an averag tax increas of more than __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ understand __PUNCT__ he not ask you to pai an extra __MONEY__ to reduc the deficit or to invest in school or to help pai for the war or to help look after our veteran __PUNCT__
that not why he ask you to pai an extra __MONEY__
he ask you to pai more so that folk like him can pai less __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
just to give you some sens of thi __PUNCT__ and again __PUNCT__ thi is not my analysi __PUNCT__ in order to afford just on __MONEY__ tax cut for somebodi like mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ __NUM__ of famili like your would have to pai anoth __MONEY__ in tax each and everi year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ not surprisingli __PUNCT__ hi campaign wa ask about thi romnei middl class tax hike __PUNCT__
and thei said the studi fail to take into account the massiv econom boom that would come from cut tax on the wealthiest american in the biggest corpor __PUNCT__
we saw how well that work the last time we tri it __PUNCT__
we know better than thi __PUNCT__
thei have been try to sell us thi trickl __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ tax cut fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
we seen thi befor __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ everi singl time __PUNCT__ it doesn't work __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to lower our deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
we do not need more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
we need tax cut for work american __PUNCT__
we need to keep tax fair and low for famili who ar try to rais their children and keep them healthi and send those kid to colleg and keep a roof over their head __PUNCT__
if we go to make sacrific __PUNCT__ we should be make it to invest in school and bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for compani __PUNCT__ especi those that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ we need tax cut for compani that ar creat job right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ right here in virginia __PUNCT__
and that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so i got __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ i got a differ plan for america __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to cut middl class tax __PUNCT__ and i kept that promis __PUNCT__ by a total of about __MONEY__ for the typic famili __PUNCT__
so now i want to keep tax exactli where thei ar on the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make under __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of american do __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ i fall in that categori __PUNCT__ some of you do too __PUNCT__ all we ask is that we can contribut a littl bit more so that we can pai down thi deficit and invest in thing like educ that will help us grow __PUNCT__
and keep in mind __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we go to make sure govern doe it part __PUNCT__ becaus there still wast in govern __PUNCT__
we alreadi made a trillion dollar worth of cut __PUNCT__
we can do more streamlin __PUNCT__
we can make govern more effici and more consum friendli __PUNCT__
but i not go to pai for a massiv new tax cut for millionair and billionair by gut invest like educ and infrastructur and basic scienc and research and the safeti net and medicar __PUNCT__ those thing that have alwai kept the middl class strong __PUNCT__
all i ask is that we go back __PUNCT__ for folk like me __PUNCT__ for the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ if you rememb __PUNCT__ that wa when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
that how we grow the economi __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ nobodi is satisfi with our pace of growth __PUNCT__
nobodi is satisfi __PUNCT__
even with all the job we creat __PUNCT__ we got to creat more __PUNCT__
but if you look at our histori __PUNCT__ if you look at the fact __PUNCT__ everi time we grown __PUNCT__ it hasn't been by the top down __PUNCT__
it been from the middl out __PUNCT__
it been from the bottom up __PUNCT__
when middl class famili ar do well __PUNCT__ lo and behold __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
if that construct worker ha got a littl extra monei in hi pocket __PUNCT__ he goe and spend it __PUNCT__ mayb on a new car __PUNCT__
when we got new teacher do great work with our kid __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ thei go to a restaur and spend that monei __PUNCT__
and so suddenli __PUNCT__ busi ar do well __PUNCT__ the economi is do well __PUNCT__ and we get into a virtuou cycl __PUNCT__
and we go up __PUNCT__
but if everybodi is struggl and all we do is reward folk who ar alreadi do so well that thei can't realli spend ani more __PUNCT__ the economi doesn't grow as fast __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ leesburg __PUNCT__ if you believ that governor romnei plan will make us better off __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ if you genuin think that we go to grow our economi faster by cut educ spend __PUNCT__ cut transport spend __PUNCT__ slash our invest in thing like basic scienc and research __PUNCT__ voucher medicar and ad to our deficit __PUNCT__ plu ask each of you to pai an extra __MONEY__ so that folk at the top can get anoth big tax break __PUNCT__ then that your plan __PUNCT__
he got it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and thei will do exactli what thei promis __PUNCT__
but you know what it mean is __PUNCT__ is that __PUNCT__ that vision to me mean we set our sight lower __PUNCT__
it mean we settl for someth less __PUNCT__
it mean that we no longer ar embrac the basic tenet that help make thi countri great __PUNCT__ and that is that everybodi can make it and everybodi doe their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ don't you think we would be better off if we keep fight for the thing that alwai made us strong __PUNCT__ if we help famili send their kid to colleg and thei not load up with a whole bunch of debt __PUNCT__ aren't we go to be better off if we develop new sourc of american energi __PUNCT__ aren't we go to be better off if we invest in advanc manufactur __PUNCT__ and we bring job back here __PUNCT__ we do insourc instead of outsourc __PUNCT__ and we sell good to the rest of the world stamp with those proud word __PUNCT__ made in virginia __PUNCT__ made in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ made by american hand __PUNCT__
when we look back __NUM__ year or __NUM__ year or __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__ aren't we go to be better off if we have the courag to keep move forward __PUNCT__ that what is at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that what i believ __PUNCT__
my hair mai be grayer than it wa __NUM__ yea ago __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i got a birthdai come up __PUNCT__ i go to be __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but michel sai i don't look a dai over __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but even though i a littl older and a littl grayer __PUNCT__ my determin to do right by you __PUNCT__ to fight for you __PUNCT__ to think about you __PUNCT__ to see myself in you __PUNCT__ to wake up everi singl dai __PUNCT__ fight as hard as i know how on behalf of america middl class and folk who ar aspir to get in the middl class __PUNCT__ that determin is undiminish __PUNCT__
my faith in you is stronger than ever __PUNCT__
and if you still believ in me like i believ in you __PUNCT__ i ask you to stand with me __PUNCT__
you got to make some phone call with me __PUNCT__ knock on some door for me __PUNCT__ recruit your friend and your neighbor with me __PUNCT__
we won loudoun counti last time __PUNCT__
and if we win loudoun counti thi time __PUNCT__ we will win virginia __PUNCT__
and if we win virginia __PUNCT__ we will win thi elect __PUNCT__
and we will finish what we start in __NUM__ and remind the world why the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__ leesburg __PUNCT__
god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
