some of you who ar here mai be try to make up your mind __PUNCT__
mayb your girlfriend drag you out here __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ mayb grandma said __PUNCT__ you got to go to the obama ralli __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you still try to figur it out __PUNCT__
so i ask you to compar my plan with governor romnei __PUNCT__
i want you to know what we propos __PUNCT__ each of us __PUNCT__ and see which plan is better for you and what is better for the futur of america __PUNCT__
so number on __PUNCT__ i want to end tax break for compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to reward small busi and manufactur who ar put down root here __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ creat american product stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
we can bring those job back to our shore __PUNCT__
number two __PUNCT__ i want to cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ so we control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
becaus of the work we alreadi done __PUNCT__ increas oil product __PUNCT__ increas natur ga product __PUNCT__ but also emphas renew like solar and wind and biofuel __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ we ar less depend on foreign oil than at in ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
that good for your pocketbook __PUNCT__
that good for our nation secur __PUNCT__
it good for the environ __PUNCT__
and on reason we been abl __PUNCT__ we have confid we can keep on make progress is we doubl the fuel effici standard for car and truck __PUNCT__
so in the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ you go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
i want us now to build on that progress __PUNCT__
we got to keep make those invest __PUNCT__
i don't want fuel __PUNCT__ effici car and long __PUNCT__ last batteri and wind turbin and solar panel produc in china __PUNCT__
i want them produc right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__
