we been travel through __PUNCT__
we went to parma and sanduski and maume __PUNCT__ and now we here __PUNCT__ and oak harbor __PUNCT__ akron __PUNCT__
and i been eat a lot __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and peopl have been comment i need to gain some weight __PUNCT__ so the __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
wait __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ who said that __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you be happi to know that i been eat __PUNCT__
and in between the eat __PUNCT__ we been talk a littl bit about polit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you gui ar get bombard with all kind of nonsens on tv __PUNCT__
so i know that sometim polit can be discourag __PUNCT__ and especi __PUNCT__ washington polit can be discourag __PUNCT__ and it can seem small and it can seem petti __PUNCT__
but the choic in thi elect could not be bigger and the stake could not be higher __PUNCT__
thi year is go to be about more than just two candid or even two polit parti __PUNCT__
what at stake thi time is two fundament differ vision about how america move forward __PUNCT__ two wai of think about thi countri __PUNCT__
when i think about america __PUNCT__ i think about my famili __PUNCT__ and i think about my grandfath who fought in world war ii __PUNCT__ and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ even with a babi __PUNCT__ wa work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when my grandfath came back home __PUNCT__ he got the opportun to go to colleg becaus of the gi bill __PUNCT__
and i think about my mom __PUNCT__ a singl mom __PUNCT__ becaus my dad left when i wa a babi __PUNCT__
so she had to rais me and my sister with the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__ and it wa tough sometim __PUNCT__ but she wa abl to do it and get her own educ and then ensur i got a great educ becaus she wa abl to get student loan and grant __PUNCT__
and then i think about michel parent __PUNCT__
her dad work at the water filtrat plant __PUNCT__ a blue collar worker in chicago __PUNCT__ and mom stai at home look after the kid __PUNCT__ and then when the kid got older __PUNCT__ she went to work as a secretari at a bank __PUNCT__ and she work there most of her life __PUNCT__
and when i think about both michel famili and my famili __PUNCT__ what i am remind of is what made america great wa thi basic idea __PUNCT__ thi basic bargain __PUNCT__ that all of you experienc in your own famili __PUNCT__ your parent __PUNCT__ your grandpar __PUNCT__ your great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ mayb some of them emigr here from someplac els __PUNCT__
but the idea wa __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you could make it if you try __PUNCT__ that it doesn't matter what you look like __PUNCT__ where you come from __PUNCT__ what church you worship in __PUNCT__
the idea is that if you ar will to put in the work and take respons for your famili __PUNCT__ just like dan wa talk about __PUNCT__ if you will to stick with it and tough it out when time got tough sometim __PUNCT__ that ultim __PUNCT__ hard work wa reward and respons wa respect __PUNCT__ and you didn't just look out for yourself but you look out for your commun as well as your famili and your countri __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ nobodi expect to get fabul rich __PUNCT__ although it wa great if peopl got rich __PUNCT__
but when i think about my famili or michel famili __PUNCT__ what made us rich wa spend time togeth __PUNCT__
and the idea wa that if our famili were of good charact and had good valu and you were will to work hard __PUNCT__ then you could find a job that paid a decent wage __PUNCT__ and eventu __PUNCT__ save up __PUNCT__ you could own a home __PUNCT__
and you knew that you wouldn't go bankrupt when you got sick becaus you had some health insur __PUNCT__ and mayb you took a vacat everi onc in a while __PUNCT__ and it wasn't necessarili some fanci vacat at some fanci resort __PUNCT__
the best vacat i had when i wa a kid wa we __PUNCT__ my grandmoth and my mom and my sister __PUNCT__ we travel around the countri on greyhound buse and on train __PUNCT__ and we stai at howard johnson __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__
and i wa __NUM__ and so if there wa ani kind of swim pool __PUNCT__ it didn't matter how big it wa __PUNCT__ right __PUNCT__ you spend the whole dai there __PUNCT__ and then you real excit to go to where the vend machin wa and the ic machin and get the ic __PUNCT__ and that wa like a big deal __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and you would just see the sight and stop by a diner someplac __PUNCT__
so you have that chanc to take a littl bit of time off to spend with your famili __PUNCT__ and then when you retir __PUNCT__ you were abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and you were part of a commun __PUNCT__
and that basic bargain is what built thi countri __PUNCT__
that what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__
that what made us the envi of the world __PUNCT__ not the fact that we had the most millionair or billionair __PUNCT__ but the fact that our economi grew from the middl out and there were ladder of opportun for peopl to get into the middl class __PUNCT__ even if thei were born poor __PUNCT__
and the reason i ran for presid __PUNCT__ the reason i ran the first time for a state senat seat on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ wa becaus for too mani peopl that bargain __PUNCT__ that dream __PUNCT__ felt like it wa slip awai for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
we had gone through a decad where peopl were work harder and harder __PUNCT__ but thei didn't see ani increas in incom __PUNCT__
and profit were go sky high for a lot of compani __PUNCT__ but job weren't grow fast enough __PUNCT__
and the cost of everyth from health care to colleg tuition to groceri to ga kept go up faster than peopl incom __PUNCT__
so a lot of folk felt like that idea that we not onli could live a good middl class life __PUNCT__ but more importantli __PUNCT__ we could pass it on to our kid and thei could succe the wai we might not have imagin __PUNCT__ thei could go to colleg and do some thing that we couldn't imagin do __PUNCT__ that felt like it wa slip awai for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
that why i got into polit __PUNCT__
that why i ran for presid __PUNCT__
that why in __NUM__ a lot of you came togeth and help support us __PUNCT__
and we didn't even realiz then that we were go to be get hit with the worst econom crisi __PUNCT__ the worst financi crisi in our lifetim __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ the hardship that occur becaus of that made that dream even a littl bit further out of reach for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
we came togeth __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ it wa independ and republican who want to figur out how do we put that basic bargain back togeth to grow the middl class not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl and from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that wa our idea __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we knew from the start in __NUM__ that turn that around wasn't go to happen overnight __PUNCT__
it didn't happen overnight __PUNCT__ and so we weren't go to revers it overnight __PUNCT__
but we been steadi __PUNCT__
we work hard __PUNCT__ and i know all of you have work hard __PUNCT__
and dan stori is typic of so mani peopl i meet who had to make adjust and deal with some disappoint __PUNCT__ but came back stronger and came back tougher __PUNCT__
and that what america and that what ohio ha been do __PUNCT__
so over the last sever year __PUNCT__ what we seen ar peopl who go out and retrain for new job __PUNCT__
and small busi have to adapt __PUNCT__ and sometim __PUNCT__ the owner doesn't take a salari just to keep folk on the payrol __PUNCT__
and i met a woman yesterdai in parma who i had met a year earlier __PUNCT__
she had been out of work for __NUM__ year and had gone back to commun colleg at the ag of __NUM__ and retrain __PUNCT__
and i saw her in the rope line after my speech __PUNCT__
she had just been certifi and wa start her new job on tuesdai and after have done __NUM__ year at a commun colleg __PUNCT__
so those stori ar duplic themselv all across ohio and all across the countri __PUNCT__
but it still tough out there __PUNCT__
we learn thi morn that our busi creat __NUM__ new job last month __PUNCT__ and that overal mean that busi have creat __NUM__ million new job over the past __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ new manufactur job __PUNCT__
that a step in the right direct __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that a step in the right direct __PUNCT__
but we can't be satisfi __PUNCT__ becaus our goal wa never to just keep on work to get back to where we were back in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i want to get back to a time when middl class famili and those work to get into the middl class have some basic secur __PUNCT__
that our goal __PUNCT__
so we got to grow the economi even faster __PUNCT__ and we got to put even more peopl back to work __PUNCT__
and we got to tap into the basic charact of thi countri __PUNCT__ becaus our charact ha not chang __PUNCT__ even though we gone through some tough time these last few year __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang our charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang what made us great __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang why we came togeth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
so again __PUNCT__ our mission is not just to get back to where we were befor the crisi __PUNCT__
we got to deal with what been happen over the last decad __PUNCT__ the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ manufactur leav our shore __PUNCT__ incom flatlin __PUNCT__ all those thing ar what we got to struggl and fight for __PUNCT__
and that the reason that i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i want to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i want to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__
rememb __PUNCT__ i told you thi wa a choic that we got to make __PUNCT__ becaus what hold us back right now is not that we don't have good answer for how we could grow the economi faster or put more peopl back to work __PUNCT__
the problem is we got a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
we got two fundament differ idea about where we should take the countri __PUNCT__
and thi __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
put congress to work __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we try to put congress to work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and thi elect is about how we break that stalem __PUNCT__
and the good new is it in your power to break thi stalem __PUNCT__
it in the power of everybodi who live in ohio __PUNCT__ everybodi who live in poland __PUNCT__ everybodi who live all across the midwest __PUNCT__
all those folk out there __PUNCT__ whether you punch a clock or start a busi __PUNCT__ you got a chanc to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
but you go to have to make a choic about which direct we go in __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ and the special interest that support them __PUNCT__ thei got a particular idea of how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
it actual a pretti simpl idea __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ their basic idea is that if we spend trillion of dollar more on tax cut __PUNCT__ most of the benefit go to some of the wealthiest individu in the countri so the averag millionair get a __MONEY__ tax break __PUNCT__ even if we got to gut educ to do it __PUNCT__ even if we got to cut job train program to do it __PUNCT__ even if we got to increas middl class tax to do it __PUNCT__ if we cut trillion of dollar in tax and we elimin regul __PUNCT__ all kind of regul __PUNCT__ the regul we just put in place to make sure that wall street doesn't engag in reckless behavior that we have to bail out later or regul that prevent insur compani from exclud peopl with preexist condit from coverag or regul that protect consum from be taken advantag of by credit card compani __PUNCT__ if we elimin all those regul and we combin those with the tax cut __PUNCT__ then wealthi investor and compani will do veri well and the benefit then will spread to everybodi els __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that the idea __PUNCT__
i not make thi up __PUNCT__
i sure that thei would sai it differ __PUNCT__ thei describ it differ __PUNCT__ but that their basic theori __PUNCT__
and you can go to mr __PUNCT__ romnei web site __PUNCT__ or you can look at the plan that the republican in the hous of repres vote for __PUNCT__ and you see that that basic their plan __PUNCT__
that their vision __PUNCT__
their basic idea is if everybodi is just on their own __PUNCT__ do what thei do __PUNCT__ everyth is go to turn out just fine __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ it a theori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i think it wrong __PUNCT__
i think it wrong __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i think it wrong __PUNCT__
and the reason i think it wrong is we just tri it __PUNCT__
we tri it in the decad befor i took offic __PUNCT__
and let look at what happen __PUNCT__
we saw us fight two war on a credit card __PUNCT__
the tax cut turn a surplu into a deficit __PUNCT__
and the lack of regul result in what happen on wall street __PUNCT__ and we end up with the biggest crisi that we ever seen __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
that ain't right __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
it ain't right __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it not a smart theori __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ if we hadn't tri it befor you might sai __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__ let give that a shot __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but we just tri it __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ if you look throughout our histori __PUNCT__ that kind of top __PUNCT__ down econom ha never work __PUNCT__
so we got to have somebodi who fight for you __PUNCT__ somebodi who think about how to grow the economi from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ not from the top down __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
i got a differ theori __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
just like their theori ha been test __PUNCT__ let talk about my theori __PUNCT__ my vision __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ and more than __NUM__ million job were on the line __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ in __NUM__ job in ohio depend on the auto industri __PUNCT__ not just the folk in the auto plant __PUNCT__ not just the union worker __PUNCT__ but all those supplier up and down the chain __PUNCT__ everi restaur outsid the plant __PUNCT__ everi store __PUNCT__ everi school depend on those job and that industri __PUNCT__ and you had some folk sai let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ and thei weren't just talk about detroit __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ we said __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ we go to bet on the american worker __PUNCT__
we go to bet on american industri __PUNCT__
and now chrysler is back __PUNCT__ and gm is the number __PUNCT__ on compani in the world __PUNCT__ and ford is on the move __PUNCT__
that my theori __PUNCT__ bet on the american worker and american busi __PUNCT__
that why i want to move us forward __PUNCT__
and i believ that what happen in the auto industri can happen in a lot of other industri __PUNCT__ becaus i believ in american manufactur __PUNCT__
the futur of american manufactur can still be forg in place like youngstown and cleveland and pittsburgh __PUNCT__
and i go to run to make sure that that happen __PUNCT__
i want to sell more good stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
and that start with us chang our tax code so we stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that ar invest right here in poland __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ in parma __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ in cincinnati __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you look at the success of dan compani __PUNCT__
i just went over and visit and took some sauc __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that i am go to us thi weekend __PUNCT__
those ar the kind of compani that start as a famili busi and ar now grow and grow and expand __PUNCT__ and suddenli thei becom medium __PUNCT__ size busi __PUNCT__ then thei becom big busi __PUNCT__
and america ha got the most competit worker on earth __PUNCT__ the most product __PUNCT__
but we got to make sure that our law ar encourag invest here in the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is a differ idea than the other gui __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ romnei experi __PUNCT__ becaus he alwai sai __PUNCT__ i got a lot of busi experi __PUNCT__ i know how to creat job __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ hi compani that he start were call the __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of busi outsourc __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
so that hi experi __PUNCT__
my experi is work with worker and manag to save the auto industri __PUNCT__
that your choic __PUNCT__ becaus i go to fight for your job here in the unit state __PUNCT__
but that not enough __PUNCT__ that not the whole vision __PUNCT__ becaus we also got to continu to improv our own competit __PUNCT__ which mean that i run to make sure that onc again __PUNCT__ our kid ar get the best educ in the world __PUNCT__
i want us to hire new teacher __PUNCT__ not lai more teacher off __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to extend the tuition tax credit that we put in place that alreadi save million of famili thousand of dollar __PUNCT__
i want to extend that __PUNCT__
we just won the fight to stop congress from let student loan rate doubl for __NUM__ million student __PUNCT__
now i want to work with colleg and univers to bring tuition down onc and for all __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to go to commun colleg and learn the skill like that woman i saw yesterdai had learn __PUNCT__ becaus there ar job out there right now that aren't match up with the skill peopl have __PUNCT__
and if we get those compani to come in and help design the train program __PUNCT__ those folk can go back to work __PUNCT__
i want __NUM__ million more of those folk benefit from that kind of partnership between busi and commun colleg __PUNCT__
i want to do more in the area of hous __PUNCT__
my administr ha alreadi help more than a million respons homeown refin their mortgag __PUNCT__
but that onli a few of the potenti famili that could take advantag of histor low rate __PUNCT__
so what we said to congress is __PUNCT__ let get to work __PUNCT__
give everybodi the chanc to refin __PUNCT__ includ folk whose home ar underwat __PUNCT__
that will save the averag famili __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
who can us __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ put that monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ and that allow you __PUNCT__ that like a huge tax cut for you __PUNCT__ which you could then spend at restaur and at store and help to pai that colleg tuition for that kid who is go off to colleg __PUNCT__
it could make all the differ in the world __PUNCT__
that my theori of how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
i run becaus i continu to be convinc that in a countri like our __PUNCT__ the greatest countri on earth __PUNCT__ nobodi should go bankrupt just becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
i am proud of the work we did to get that health care law pass __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
john boccieri know it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
over in parma yesterdai __PUNCT__ i saw a woman john and i both know name natoma canfield __PUNCT__
i got a letter that she wrote __PUNCT__ hung up in the oval offic __PUNCT__ that talk about her fear when she got cancer and the fact that she wasn't sure she ever be abl to get insur again __PUNCT__
and she kept on try to hang onto it becaus she wa worri she get that cancer back __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ she had to let her insur go __PUNCT__ and she didn't know what wa go to happen __PUNCT__
and becaus of thi bill __PUNCT__ she is abl to get the treatment she need __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ i work with anybodi who want to continu to work __PUNCT__ whether it the state level or the feder level __PUNCT__ to continu to improv thi law __PUNCT__
but it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__ to make sure that if you got a preexist condit __PUNCT__ you can still get health insur __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
for those of you who alreadi have health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing thi doe is make your health insur more secur __PUNCT__ becaus it mean insur compani can't impos lifetim limit or us fine print __PUNCT__ so when you realli need it __PUNCT__ suddenli __PUNCT__ the insur isn't there __PUNCT__
it what allow your kid to potenti stai on your health insur polici up to __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
it help senior get a better deal on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
and it will help peopl who don't have health insur for the first time be abl to get it at afford price __PUNCT__
it the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ when you hear all these folk sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thi is a tax __PUNCT__ thi is a burden on middl class famili __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ we know becaus the gui i run against tri thi in massachusett and it work just fine __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ even though now he deni it __PUNCT__
basic __PUNCT__ what we sai is __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ if you have health insur __PUNCT__ you all good __PUNCT__ if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ we help you get it __PUNCT__
if you can afford to bui health insur and you don't get it __PUNCT__ so that you forc us to pai for your health care when you get sick or you get in an accid __PUNCT__ that ain't right __PUNCT__
so what we go to do is __PUNCT__ we go to charg you a penalti to make sure that you not unload those cost on everybodi els __PUNCT__
it will affect less than __NUM__ percent of the popul __PUNCT__ becaus most american ar respons and do the right thing __PUNCT__
i make no apolog for it __PUNCT__
we go to keep it move forward __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ it the right thing to do now __PUNCT__ and we go to keep move __PUNCT__
