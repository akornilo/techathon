obama __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
my oppon is a big believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
he think that if we just spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion on tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ if we get rid of regul on wall street __PUNCT__ then all our problem will be solv __PUNCT__
and job and prosper will trickl down on all of you __PUNCT__ and the deficit will disappear __PUNCT__ and we live happili ever after __PUNCT__

top __PUNCT__ down econom never work __PUNCT__
we don't need to doubl down on the same trickl __PUNCT__ down polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
we don't need polici that just help folk at the veri top __PUNCT__
that not how the countri grow __PUNCT__
that not how we succe __PUNCT__
we succe when the middl class is get bigger __PUNCT__ when more peopl have the chanc to get ahead and live up to their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
we don't get veri far when we got leader who write off half the nation as a bunch of victim who don't take respons for their live __PUNCT__
let me tell you __PUNCT__ i been to nevada a lot __PUNCT__
you gui mai get tire of me __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

but as i travel around the state __PUNCT__ i don't see a lot of victim __PUNCT__
i see a lot of hard __PUNCT__ work nevadan __PUNCT__
i see student try to work their wai through school __PUNCT__
i see singl mom try to put in overtim to rais their kid __PUNCT__
i see senior citizen who save all their live becaus thei work all their live to earn their retir __PUNCT__
i see veteran who serv thi countri brave __PUNCT__
i see soldier who defend our freedom todai __PUNCT__
we don't believ that anybodi is entitl to success __PUNCT__
we don't believ govern should help peopl who aren't try to help themselv __PUNCT__
but we do believ in someth call opportun __PUNCT__
we believ that hard work should pai off in thi countri __PUNCT__ that respons should be reward in thi countri __PUNCT__ that thi is a countri where everybodi should get a fair shot and everybodi should do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
we believ in an america where no matter what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ what your last name is __PUNCT__ who you love __PUNCT__ that you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that the countri i believ in __PUNCT__
that what i been fight for __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ what i want to promot is a new econom patriot __PUNCT__ on that root in the belief that we grow the economi best when everybodi ha got a shot and the middl class is thrive __PUNCT__
and i won't pretend that it go to be easi to get there __PUNCT__
it took us a bunch of year to get us into thi mess __PUNCT__ it go to take a few more to get us out __PUNCT__
but i want everybodi to know that our challeng can be solv __PUNCT__ our problem can be met __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world and the best entrepreneur and the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best busi __PUNCT__ the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__
there isn't a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ the path i offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
so i put forward a specif __PUNCT__ practic plan to creat job and grow the middl class and rebuild our economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
so i want you to know what thi plan is so when you talk to folk you can sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ here what he go to do __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i want to export more product __PUNCT__ but i want to outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
you rememb when the auto industri wa about to go under __PUNCT__ my oppon said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ let come togeth and reinvent a dy auto industri __PUNCT__ and now it back on top of the world __PUNCT__
we creat more than half a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can keep give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can reward compani that ar open new plant and hire new worker right here in nevada __PUNCT__
that what i want to do __PUNCT__
i want to help big factori and small busi export more __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job __PUNCT__ but you go to have to vote to make it happen __PUNCT__
i want us to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__ that the second part of our plan __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of do noth __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__ and it will be good for our economi __PUNCT__ and it good for our nation secur __PUNCT__ and it good for our environ __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi we gener from sourc like wind and solar right here in nevada and all across the countri __PUNCT__
thousand of american have job build wind turbin and solar panel and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__ we could revers thi progress __PUNCT__ like governor romnei want to do __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can build on it __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let the oil compani write our energi plan __PUNCT__
i not go to let oil compani collect __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better plan __PUNCT__ where we invest in wind and solar and farmer and scientist who ar har new biofuel to power our car and where construct worker ar build home and factori that wast less energi and we invest to get out a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__
we can creat hundr of thousand of job here in nevada and all across the countri and cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that my plan __PUNCT__
but you got to vote if we go to make it happen __PUNCT__
i want to give more american the chanc to get a great educ and get the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__ that the third part of my plan __PUNCT__
educ is the onli reason i stand here todai __PUNCT__ son of a singl mom __PUNCT__
it the onli reason michel got a chanc __PUNCT__
and so now the question is __PUNCT__ ar we go to give that opportun to everybodi __PUNCT__ right now there ar million of student who ar pai less for colleg becaus we took awai billion of dollar that were go to bank and we said let give them directli to student __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__ we can gut our invest in educ __PUNCT__ like governor romnei want to do __PUNCT__ to pai for more tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__
or we can decid __PUNCT__ here in nevada and here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom __PUNCT__
no famili should set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look in some other countri becaus thei can't find the worker thei need with the right skill here at home __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ i need you to help me recruit __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ improv our earli educ system __PUNCT__ creat __NUM__ million more slot in the commun colleg so worker can get train for the new job that ar out there right now __PUNCT__
help us work with colleg and univers to keep tuition down __PUNCT__
that a goal we can meet togeth __PUNCT__
you can choos that futur for america __PUNCT__
but if we go to do that __PUNCT__ what do you need to do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
vote __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you go to need to vote __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ i want to reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class and work class famili __PUNCT__
my plan would do just that __PUNCT__
and i alreadi work with republican and democrat to cut spend by a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
i will to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
i want to reform our tax code so it simpl and it fair __PUNCT__ but i also want to ask the wealthiest household in america to pai slightli higher tax over incom of __MONEY__
that the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
so that my plan __PUNCT__
and in fair __PUNCT__ my oppon ha got a plan too __PUNCT__
that onli on problem __PUNCT__ some of you heard bill clinton sai there no arithmet in it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ thei think that somehow you can lower our deficit by spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion on new break for the wealthi __PUNCT__
but no matter how mani time thei try to __PUNCT__ reboot __PUNCT__ their campaign and try to explain it __PUNCT__ thei can't __PUNCT__
thei can't explain how you spend __MONEY__ trillion on tax cut for the wealthi without rais tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__
how do you spend __MONEY__ trillion on new militari spend that our militari hasn't ask for and cut our deficit __PUNCT__ you can't do it __PUNCT__
the math doesn't add up __PUNCT__
governor romnei said he thought it wa fair for somebodi make __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ like him __PUNCT__ to pai a lower tax rate than a cop or a teacher or somebodi work over at on of the casino who make __MONEY__
now __PUNCT__ i don't think that fair __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i don't think that how we grow our economi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up the deduct thei have for own a home or rais their kid just so me or governor romnei get a tax break __PUNCT__
i don't want to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick kid out of head start or elimin health insur for million of poor or elderli or disabl american just so millionair and billionair can get a tax cut __PUNCT__
we can't afford it __PUNCT__
i don't think the answer for all the hard __PUNCT__ work folk here in nevada and across the countri whose home ar underwat is just to do noth and wait it out __PUNCT__
that wa governor romnei advic __PUNCT__ just let the whole hous market bottom out __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ my administr __PUNCT__ we have alreadi help more than a million respons homeown refin their mortgag __PUNCT__
i run to let them get __PUNCT__ i run to make sure that everybodi __PUNCT__ more peopl like them who ar respons __PUNCT__ who have been pai and make their mortgag payment __PUNCT__ that thei have a chanc to refin and save up to __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i never go to turn medicar into a voucher program __PUNCT__
we not go to do that either __PUNCT__
if you been work all your life and now you about to retir __PUNCT__ you shouldn't have to spend your golden year at the merci of an insur compani __PUNCT__
we go to reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul the right wai by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by shift it onto senior __PUNCT__
and we not go to __PUNCT__ we ar go to keep the promis of social secur __PUNCT__
we not go to turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
and just like we do work here at home __PUNCT__ we go to continu to do work abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
i said we go to wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we ar __PUNCT__
and while a twin tower __PUNCT__ new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ and osama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as we saw a coupl of week ago __PUNCT__ we still face seriou threat around the world __PUNCT__
and that why __PUNCT__ so long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will make sure we alwai have the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but you know the thing that make our militari strongest is the amaz men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
so when thei take off that uniform __PUNCT__ when thei come home __PUNCT__ we got to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fought for us should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care thei deserv __PUNCT__ when thei come home __PUNCT__
nobodi __PUNCT__
governor romnei ha got a differ set of idea __PUNCT__
he think the wai i end the war in iraq is __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__
he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we don't know __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and i go to us the monei we no longer spend on war to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__ rebuild our road and our bridg and put american back to work __PUNCT__
that part of what make america strong __PUNCT__
that what we go to do __PUNCT__
so thi is the choic we face in thi elect __PUNCT__
thi is what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
and you ar go to hear over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ i know you must be tire of hear ad __PUNCT__ but you go to hear more over the next __NUM__ __PUNCT__ or the next __NUM__ week __PUNCT__
and over and over again __PUNCT__ you go to hear my oppon talk about how bigger tax cut and fewer regul __PUNCT__ that the wai to go __PUNCT__ and sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their basic theori is __PUNCT__ if you can't afford health care __PUNCT__ then hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if you can't afford colleg __PUNCT__ borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
i don't think govern can solv all our problem __PUNCT__ but govern is not the sourc of all our problem either __PUNCT__
there ar some thing we got to do togeth __PUNCT__
instead of go around blame somebodi __PUNCT__ union or immigr or gai or somebodi __PUNCT__ for what go on __PUNCT__ what we need to do is pull togeth __PUNCT__
we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we believ that america onli work when we all accept respons for ourselv and for each other __PUNCT__
that how we creat more opportun __PUNCT__ more possibl __PUNCT__
america is not about what can be done for you __PUNCT__ it about what can be done by us togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and on peopl __PUNCT__
and that what you understood back in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
you the reason senior across nevada ar averag nearli __MONEY__ less on their medicin becaus of health care reform __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason that student __PUNCT__ thousand of student at unlv and school across thi state __PUNCT__ have more help pai for colleg __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you the reason why two grandpar in reno could refin their mortgag and keep their piec of the american dream __PUNCT__
you the reason why a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason why an outstand soldier won't be kick out of the militari just becaus of who he love __PUNCT__
you the reason why thousand of famili have been abl to sai to the love on who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
welcom home __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
i made thi point down in florida the other dai __PUNCT__ and governor romnei heard me sai you can't make chang just from washington __PUNCT__
and somehow __PUNCT__ he got all excit about thi __PUNCT__
he chang hi speech __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ i go to make chang from the insid __PUNCT__
and it got me think __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what kind of insid job is he talk about __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ is he talk about the insid job where outsourc ar write the tax code __PUNCT__ is he talk about the insid job where oil compani ar write the energi plan and health insur compani ar write the insur plan __PUNCT__ is he talk about the insid job where a bunch of men in washington decid women can't make their own health care decis __PUNCT__ becaus if that the insid job he talk about __PUNCT__ we don't want it __PUNCT__
we don't need it __PUNCT__
chang is onli go to happen when ordinari american __PUNCT__ work togeth with their elect repres __PUNCT__ make all our voic heard __PUNCT__
that how chang happen __PUNCT__
so the question then is __PUNCT__ how hard ar you will to work for it __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
hard __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
how hard ar you will to work for it __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
hard __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we got just a few more week left __PUNCT__
and in __NUM__ when i won __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of the peopl didn't vote for me __PUNCT__ thei vote for john mccain __PUNCT__
and that the wai democraci work __PUNCT__
and i said on elect night __PUNCT__ i said to the peopl who didn't vote for me __PUNCT__ especi __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ i mai not have won your vote __PUNCT__ but i heard your voic __PUNCT__
i need your help __PUNCT__ and i go to fight for you too __PUNCT__
i go to work on your behalf too __PUNCT__
becaus i not interest in creat democrat job or republican job __PUNCT__ i interest in creat american job __PUNCT__
i don't want to improv school in the blue state or red state __PUNCT__ i want to improv school in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i not just fight for valu that ar worker valu or busi valu or rich peopl valu or poor peopl valu or black or white or hispan or asian or nativ america or abl or not __PUNCT__ disabl __PUNCT__ i fight for american valu __PUNCT__
and those valu of hard work and individu respons __PUNCT__ but also look out for on anoth __PUNCT__ those ar valu that we all share __PUNCT__
those ar valu that belong to all of us __PUNCT__
and now we got to reclaim them __PUNCT__
if you ar will to work hard __PUNCT__ harder than you did __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ if you will to knock on some door and make some phone call __PUNCT__ we can reclaim those valu __PUNCT__
we can ralli around a new econom patriot __PUNCT__
we can rebuild thi economi __PUNCT__
we can strengthen the middl class __PUNCT__
we can keep move forward __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
