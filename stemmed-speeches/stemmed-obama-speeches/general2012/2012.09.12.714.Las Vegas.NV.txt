we will not be deter __PUNCT__
we will keep go __PUNCT__
we will keep go becaus the world need us __PUNCT__
we ar the on indispens power in the world __PUNCT__
and if we ar go to see peac and secur for our children and our grandchildren __PUNCT__ then that mean that thi gener of american ha to lead __PUNCT__
we go to have to keep do the work __PUNCT__ no matter how hard it seem sometim __PUNCT__
and that what i want to talk to you about here todai __PUNCT__
we got work to do oversea __PUNCT__ we also got to do some work here at home __PUNCT__
and we got to do some work right here in the great state of nevada __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ becaus nevada is a battleground state __PUNCT__ you ar awar that we got an elect go on __PUNCT__
unless you accident stumbl in here look for a convent of podiatrist __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ then you been pai some attent to the elect __PUNCT__
both parti just came out with their convent __PUNCT__
each side made it case __PUNCT__
and now you choic __PUNCT__ face a veri big choic __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ our vision __PUNCT__ what we fight for __PUNCT__ the reason all of you ar here todai __PUNCT__ is becaus we believ in the basic bargain that built the largest middl class and the strongest economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
it a bargain that sai hard work will pai off __PUNCT__ that if you act respons __PUNCT__ you be reward __PUNCT__ that everybodi get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi doe their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from main street to wall street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__ that it doesn't matter where you come from or what you look like or what your last name is __PUNCT__ here in america you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what we believ in __PUNCT__
and that basic bargain is why i ran for presid in the first place and why so mani of you work hard to get me elect presid __PUNCT__
we had seen for a decad too mani job disappear oversea __PUNCT__
we had seen too mani famili struggl while cost were go up but paycheck weren't go up __PUNCT__
peopl rack up more debt just to pai the mortgag or pai tuition or put ga in the car or food on the tabl __PUNCT__
and these misguid polici led to the biggest recess we seen sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
million of innoc american __PUNCT__ especi here in nevada __PUNCT__ lost their home __PUNCT__ their job __PUNCT__ their save __PUNCT__
and we ar still fight to recov from that __PUNCT__
nevada got hit harder than most __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ i don't think the best answer for todai new challeng ar old sale pitch __PUNCT__
and that what my oppon and the other side have been sell __PUNCT__
you gui heard it __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ you mai not have watch their convent __PUNCT__ but if you didn't __PUNCT__ let me summar __PUNCT__
what thei said wa __PUNCT__ we want to give you more tax cut __PUNCT__ especi tilt toward the wealthi __PUNCT__ and everyth will be okai __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and thi is their prescript for everyth __PUNCT__ tax cut in good time __PUNCT__ tax cut in bad time __PUNCT__ tax cut when we at peac __PUNCT__ tax cut when we at war __PUNCT__ tax cut to help you lose those few extra pound __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ tax cut to give your love life that extra kick __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ i cut tax __PUNCT__ but i cut them for folk who need them __PUNCT__
we cut tax for middl class famili __PUNCT__
we cut tax for small __PUNCT__ busi owner __PUNCT__
but i sure do not believ that anoth round of tax break for millionair will bring good job back to our shore __PUNCT__
i don't believ that it will bring down our deficit __PUNCT__
i don't think that fire teacher or kick student off of financi aid will grow our economi __PUNCT__
i don't think that will help us compet when china is churn out more engin and scientist __PUNCT__
after all we been through __PUNCT__ doe anybodi actual believ that roll back regul on wall street is somehow go to help small __PUNCT__ businesswomen here in la vega or the laid __PUNCT__ off construct worker here in la vega get back to work __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ we tri that __PUNCT__
we tri it for a long time __PUNCT__
we tri it for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and what happen __PUNCT__ it didn't work __PUNCT__
we ar not go to try someth that we know didn't work __PUNCT__ that got us into the mess in the first place __PUNCT__
we ar not go back __PUNCT__
we ar go forward __PUNCT__
we ar go forward __PUNCT__
we ar go forward __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we don't believ that the answer to our challeng is to tell folk __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
if you sick __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if you lose your home __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
if you can't afford colleg __PUNCT__ see if you can borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
we don't believ in that __PUNCT__
we believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
we don't believ in an economi that grow from the top down __PUNCT__
we believ in an economi that grow from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__ give everybodi a chanc __PUNCT__ give everybodi a ladder for opportun __PUNCT__ open up door for peopl so that thei can work hard and do right by their famili and do right by themselv __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__ becaus we move forward togeth __PUNCT__ not on our own __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i won't pretend __PUNCT__ some of you heard me at the convent __PUNCT__ i won't pretend that what i offer is the easiest path __PUNCT__
i never said that __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ i didn't sai it wa go to be easi __PUNCT__
and as presid clinton remind us last week __PUNCT__ it go to take more than a few year to solv challeng that have been build up over decad __PUNCT__
but we made progress __PUNCT__
everi time i meet a child whose parent tell me __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ she wa sick __PUNCT__ but you help her get insur __PUNCT__ everi time i meet somebodi who said __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ we were abl to refin our home and we been abl to save some monei __PUNCT__ everi time i meet a spous who sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ you promis to bring my husband or my wife back from iraq __PUNCT__ and thei back now __PUNCT__ everi time i see that happen __PUNCT__ i remind of the progress that we made __PUNCT__
and we got a long wai to go __PUNCT__
but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ when we hear folk sai that somehow thi nation is in declin __PUNCT__ thei ar dead wrong __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__ some of them right here in la vega __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__ some of them right here in la vega __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and the best research __PUNCT__ the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__
we got thi incred divers that you see in thi audienc and you see all across the countri __PUNCT__ peopl from everi background __PUNCT__ but all bound togeth by thi creed __PUNCT__ thi faith that we have in thi nation __PUNCT__
there is not anoth countri on earth that would not gladli trade place with the unit state __PUNCT__
so our problem can be solv __PUNCT__ and our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
and the path we offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__ and i am ask you to choos that futur __PUNCT__
i ask you to ralli around the goal i laid out at the convent __PUNCT__ to creat new manufactur job and new energi sourc and improv our educ system and bring down our deficit and turn the page on a decad of war __PUNCT__
we can do that in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ just in case there ar a few of you who aren't convinc yet __PUNCT__ or i need you to go out and do some convinc of some folk that mai not be convinc yet __PUNCT__ let me break down exactli what i talk about when i sai a set of goal for thi countri __PUNCT__
i got a plan __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ thi countri ha creat over half a million new manufactur job in the last 2½ year __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can keep give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that ar invest right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker to creat good __PUNCT__ pai job right here __PUNCT__
that what we can do __PUNCT__
we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can continu the progress we made expand tourism that ha a huge impact here in vega __PUNCT__
you can make that happen __PUNCT__
we will make it happen if we move forward __PUNCT__
but it up to you __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i got a plan to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__
it will be good for our economi __PUNCT__ good for our environ __PUNCT__
we have doubl the amount of renew energi we gener __PUNCT__ includ right here in nevada __PUNCT__ solar panel all across thi state __PUNCT__
so not onli ar we gener energi that we need to grow __PUNCT__ but we can also emploi thousand of american __PUNCT__
thousand of american have job todai build wind turbin and solar panel and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__ we can revers that progress __PUNCT__ or we can build on it __PUNCT__
we can keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal __PUNCT__
and our farmer and scientist can har new biofuel __PUNCT__
our construct worker can build home and factori that wast less energi and retrofit old build __PUNCT__ put them back to work in a wai that help free ourselv from depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
we can develop a hundr __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
if you choos thi path __PUNCT__ we can cut our oil import in half by __NUM__ and we could support more than __NUM__ job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
but you can also choos the altern __PUNCT__ which is to let the oil compani write our energi plan __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but that move backward __PUNCT__
and what do we want to do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we want to move forward __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign about __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i got a plan to give more american the chanc to get the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa the gatewai of opportun for me __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai of opportun for michel __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai of opportun for mani of you __PUNCT__
it is the gatewai to a middl class life __PUNCT__
becaus of the work we alreadi did __PUNCT__ million of student right here in nevada and all across the countri ar pai less for colleg todai __PUNCT__
we took on a system that wa wast billion of taxpay dollar on bank and lender __PUNCT__
we cut out the middl man __PUNCT__
let give the monei directli to the student __PUNCT__ and we help million of young peopl all across thi countri __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we could take my oppon advic __PUNCT__ which result in gut educ __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
don't boo __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
or we can decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have their dream defer becaus of an overcrowd classroom __PUNCT__
last time i wa here in vega __PUNCT__ we were hear about class that had __NUM__ kid in them __PUNCT__
kid sit on the floor __PUNCT__
old __PUNCT__ wornout textbook __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find the right skill worker here at home __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not how we move forward __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ i ask you to help recruit a hundr thousand math and scienc teacher in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ help give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to studi at commun colleg to get the skill thei need for the job that ar hire right now __PUNCT__
help us work with colleg and univers to cut in half the growth of tuition cost __PUNCT__
we can meet that goal __PUNCT__
you can choos that futur for america __PUNCT__ not just for yourself __PUNCT__ but for your kid and your grandkid __PUNCT__
that what we mean when we sai we got to move forward __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__ we got to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
it import __PUNCT__ but we got to do it in a wai that doesn't stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
independ analysi show my plan for reduc the deficit would cut it by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
i alreadi work with republican in congress to cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__ and i will to do more __PUNCT__
i want to reform the tax code so that it fair and so that it simpl __PUNCT__
but i also want to ask the wealthiest household __PUNCT__ includ my own __PUNCT__ to pai a littl bit more on incom over __MONEY__ the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
the same rate we had when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
that the wai we have to move forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ just to be fair __PUNCT__ the other side __PUNCT__ thei got a plan too __PUNCT__
the problem is __PUNCT__ as presid clinton point out __PUNCT__ thei don't have ani arithmet in it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the math doesn't add up __PUNCT__
becaus if you think we can somehow lower our deficit by spend trillion more on new tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__ when you try to pai for __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut without rais tax on middl class famili or add __MONEY__ trillion in new militari spend that our joint chief don't sai is go to make us safer without increas the deficit __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you got a __PUNCT__ you get that error messag on your calcul __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ no amount of extra credit is go to make that math work __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili like your to pai more so that millionair and billionair can pai less __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg so i can pai less __PUNCT__
i refus to kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl just for those __PUNCT__ just so those with the most can pai less __PUNCT__
i don't believ in that __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not how we go to grow our economi __PUNCT__
i don't think the answer for hard __PUNCT__ work folk here in nevada whose home ar underwat is to do noth __PUNCT__ let it bottom out __PUNCT__
my administr ha alreadi help more than a million respons homeown refin their mortgag __PUNCT__ and i run to give more like them the chanc to refin and save __MONEY__ a year and mayb start build up some equiti back __PUNCT__
that will strengthen the hous market across the board in thi state __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i will never turn medicar into a voucher __PUNCT__ becaus no american should have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
you should retir after a lifetim of labor with some digniti and some respect __PUNCT__
you have earn it __PUNCT__
we reform medicar for the long haul the right wai by bring down cost __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost onto senior __PUNCT__
and we keep the promis of social secur by take respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ not by turn it over to wall street like a stack of poker chip __PUNCT__
that the choic that you face thi fall __PUNCT__
that what we mean when we talk about move forward __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ rebuild our economi is essenti __PUNCT__ but as we were remind todai __PUNCT__ our prosper at home is link to our polici abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
a dai after 9/11 __PUNCT__ we ar remind that a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ but al qaida is on the path to defeat and bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
we still face threat in thi world __PUNCT__ and we got to remain vigil __PUNCT__
and that why we will be relentless in our pursuit of those who attack us yesterdai __PUNCT__
but that also why so long as i command in chief we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop come home and take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who ha fought for america should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
that is a solemn commit that we make __PUNCT__
and as we wind down these war __PUNCT__ we can us some of the monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild road and bridg and runwai and school __PUNCT__ becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here in the unit state __PUNCT__ right here at home __PUNCT__
so let me sai thi __PUNCT__
let me sai thi __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__
we can get all thi done __PUNCT__
i have no doubt in my mind we can get it done __PUNCT__
the power to do it __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ is in your hand __PUNCT__
i told you at the convent __PUNCT__ the elect __NUM__ year ago wa not about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you and the chang that you imagin for thi countri __PUNCT__
you ar the reason senior across nevada save an averag of nearli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ last year on their medicin becaus of health care reform __PUNCT__
you the reason thousand of student at unlv have more help pai for colleg thi year __PUNCT__
you the reason two grandpar in reno could refin their mortgag and keep their piec of the american dream __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever known __PUNCT__
you the reason why we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
you the reason why those who fought so brave for us can come back and hear those two amaz word __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
you ar the reason that happen __PUNCT__
and that why we can't turn back now __PUNCT__
if you bui into all the cynic that be fed to you through these neg ad __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ chang won't happen if you stop fight for it __PUNCT__
if you give up on the idea that your voic can make a differ __PUNCT__ then you know who go to fill the void __PUNCT__ the lobbyist __PUNCT__ the special interest __PUNCT__ the folk who ar write these __MONEY__ million check to run all those neg ad __PUNCT__ the peopl who ar try to make it harder for you to vote __PUNCT__ the politician in washington who want to decid who you can marri __PUNCT__ who want to decid for women what their health care choic should be when women ar perfectli capabl of make those decis themselv __PUNCT__
we cannot let that happen __PUNCT__ nevada __PUNCT__
we got the power to make sure it doesn't happen __PUNCT__ but i need your help __PUNCT__
we come too far to turn back now __PUNCT__
we got more good job to creat __PUNCT__ and we got too much homegrown energi to gener __PUNCT__
we got more young peopl to send to colleg and more good school to build and more good teacher to hire __PUNCT__
we got more troop to bring home and more veteran to take care of __PUNCT__
and we got more door of opportun to open to everybodi __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ disabl __PUNCT__ not disabl __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ straight __PUNCT__ anybodi who will to work hard and believ in america __PUNCT__ we got to open those door of opportun for them __PUNCT__
that why i ask for a second term __PUNCT__
and if you will to work with me and fight for me and knock on some door with me and make some phone call with me __PUNCT__ if you vote in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we will win here in clark counti __PUNCT__
we will win nevada __PUNCT__
we will win thi elect __PUNCT__
we will finish what we start __PUNCT__ and you and i togeth will remind the world why we ar the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
