my oppon __PUNCT__ he believ in top down econom __PUNCT__ think that if you spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion on a tax cut skew toward the wealthi that prosper will rain down on everybodi els __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no hiss or boo __PUNCT__ just vote __PUNCT__ that what we need __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ vote __PUNCT__
but the idea is you do that __PUNCT__ mayb get rid of some regul __PUNCT__ deficit will disappear __PUNCT__ we all live happili ever after __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the problem __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is we just tri thi __PUNCT__
we tri it dure the last decad __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__
top down econom never work __PUNCT__
the countri doesn't succe when just those at the veri top ar do well __PUNCT__
we succe when the middl class get bigger __PUNCT__ when it feel greater secur __PUNCT__ when everybodi ha got a chanc to climb into that middl class and everybodi ha a chanc to live up to their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
we can't get veri far if we just write off half the countri as a bunch of victim __PUNCT__ or presum that somehow thei want to be depend on govern or don't want to take respons for their own live __PUNCT__
becaus wherev i travel __PUNCT__ folk ar work hard __PUNCT__
folk understand everybodi ha got to take initi __PUNCT__
peopl understand that we all respons for ourselv __PUNCT__
but peopl also understand that we got oblig to each other __PUNCT__
when i go and meet student who ar try to work through colleg __PUNCT__ or singl mom put in overtim to give their child a better futur __PUNCT__ or senior citizen who __PUNCT__ after a lifetim of labor __PUNCT__ ar look forward to a secur retir __PUNCT__ or veteran who have serv thi countri and those in uniform who ar fight to defend our freedom right now __PUNCT__ thei not victim __PUNCT__
and thei sure do take a lot of respons __PUNCT__
and we don't believ anybodi is entitl to success or that govern can help peopl who don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__ but we do believ in someth call opportun __PUNCT__
we believ in thi countri hard work should pai off __PUNCT__ and respons should be reward __PUNCT__ and everybodi should have a fair shot __PUNCT__ and everybodi should do their fair share __PUNCT__ and everybodi should plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
that the countri we believ in __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i not suggest thi is go to be easi __PUNCT__
we just went through the worst recess sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
we got big challeng __PUNCT__ and some of those challeng have built up over decad __PUNCT__
but wherev i travel __PUNCT__ on of the thing i try to commun is how much confid i have in thi countri __PUNCT__ becaus we ar american __PUNCT__ and we got so mani thing go for us __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__ and the best busi peopl in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best univers __PUNCT__ the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best research and scientist __PUNCT__
we have the most divers popul __PUNCT__ full of innov and risk taker __PUNCT__
there not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and that why peopl continu to travel here from all across the globe in search of opportun __PUNCT__
so we got what it take to succe __PUNCT__
but what prevent us from realiz all that potenti in part is the polit we been see in washington __PUNCT__
and part of what thi elect is about is give the american peopl a voic to break the deadlock and break the gridlock __PUNCT__ and chart a cours that mai be harder but lead to a better place __PUNCT__
what i offer is a practic __PUNCT__ specif plan to creat job and grow the middl class __PUNCT__ rebuild thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
and that mean export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
it start there __PUNCT__
when there were those who said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ a million job ar at stake __PUNCT__ we not go to do that __PUNCT__
an icon american industri is at stake __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ Â½ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
we seen half a million new job in manufactur __PUNCT__ the fastest pace sinc the 1990 __PUNCT__
and so the choic now is __PUNCT__ do we revers that progress or do we move forward __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
right answer __PUNCT__
instead of give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ we want to give tax break to compani that ar invest in new plant and equip and worker right here in milwauke __PUNCT__ right here in wisconsin __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we want to doubl export __PUNCT__
we could creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year if we make the right choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i want us to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we doubl fuel __PUNCT__ effici standard on car __PUNCT__
we have doubl the product of clean energi __PUNCT__
your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga as a consequ of the work that we done __PUNCT__
we invest in wind and solar __PUNCT__ and thousand of job have been creat all across america in these industri __PUNCT__ build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than it been in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
and now you got a choic __PUNCT__ do you build on that progress __PUNCT__ move forward __PUNCT__ or do we revers it __PUNCT__ becaus that what my oppon is propos __PUNCT__
i got a differ vision than he doe __PUNCT__ becaus i not go to let oil compani write our energi polici __PUNCT__
i don't want to keep give them a __MONEY__ billion subsidi when thei make record profit __PUNCT__
i want to us that monei to invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ and a lot of farmer and scientist to har new biofuel to power our car and truck __PUNCT__ put construct worker back to work retrofit home and build and school and hospit to make them more energi __PUNCT__ effici __PUNCT__ develop a nearli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
and if we do those thing __PUNCT__ our plan will cut in half by __NUM__ our oil import and creat hundr of thousand of job to boot __PUNCT__
that how we move forward __PUNCT__
i want american to have the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
it wa the gatewai of opportun for me and for michel and for mani of you __PUNCT__
and so todai __PUNCT__ becaus of the work that we done over the last four year __PUNCT__ million of student ar abl to go to colleg becaus we have taken billion of dollar that were be wast in the student loan program and made sure that that monei wa go directli to student __PUNCT__
we seen reform in __NUM__ of the __NUM__ state as a consequ of our race to the top initi __PUNCT__
so we make progress __PUNCT__
now we got a choic __PUNCT__ becaus the other side want to gut our invest in educ to pai for tax break for wealthi individu __PUNCT__
and i got a differ vision __PUNCT__ becaus i don't think there ani child that should be defer their dream becaus of an overcrowd classroom or outdat textbook __PUNCT__
i don't think there should be ani famili who get a colleg accept letter and ha to sai __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ we can't do it becaus we can't afford it __PUNCT__
and there shouldn't be a compani in america that end up look in china for the worker thei need becaus thei can't find them right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so i go to need your help to hire __NUM__ new math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ and improv earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ and give __NUM__ million more worker the skill thei need __PUNCT__ to go to commun colleg to train for the job that ar out there right now __PUNCT__ and to work with colleg and univers to cut the growth in tuition __PUNCT__
we can meet those goal __PUNCT__
we can choos that futur __PUNCT__
but that what at stake over the next sever week in thi elect __PUNCT__
we need to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ but we need to do it right __PUNCT__
i put forward a __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ a __MONEY__ trillion deficit reduct packag without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
and i alreadi work with republican to cut a trillion in spend __PUNCT__
i will to do more __PUNCT__
i will to work with them __PUNCT__
we need a tax code that is fair and simpl __PUNCT__
but we not just go to cut our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ hi basic propos is we give a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut so that somebodi make __MONEY__ million a year would get a __MONEY__ tax break __PUNCT__
and everi independ analyst who look at it sai the onli wai you pai for that is to ask middl class famili to pai even more in tax than thei do right now __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i just got a differ vision __PUNCT__
what i said is folk who can afford it __PUNCT__ like me __PUNCT__ can pai a littl more __PUNCT__
we can keep tax low for your first __MONEY__ worth of incom __PUNCT__ but after that we can go back to the rate that bill clinton had in place when he wa presid __PUNCT__ when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
becaus what happen is when middl __PUNCT__ class famili ar do well __PUNCT__ busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ thei make more profit __PUNCT__ thei hire more worker __PUNCT__ and we on a virtuou path __PUNCT__
my oppon plan __PUNCT__ the math just doesn't add up __PUNCT__
bill clinton point that out __PUNCT__ you need some arithmet to present a budget and to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
and you can't reduc a deficit if you spend trillion of dollar more on tax cut for folk who don't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
and that the reason thei haven't been abl to explain how it add up __PUNCT__ becaus it doesn't add up __PUNCT__
i been veri clear __PUNCT__
on thing i not go to do __PUNCT__ i am not go to slash invest in educ and make young peopl pai more for colleg just to pai for a tax cut for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__
i not go to kick them off of head start __PUNCT__ i not go to shortchang our invest in basic research that could help us find cure for alzheim and cancer __PUNCT__ we not go to turn medicar into a voucher program in order to pai for tax cut for the veri wealthi __PUNCT__
we not go to elimin health care for million of poor and elderli and disabl american __PUNCT__
when it come to medicar __PUNCT__ we need to reduc health care cost __PUNCT__ we don't need to shift them onto senior __PUNCT__ ask them to pai thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
and that what the voucher program that governor romnei and mr __PUNCT__ ryan ar propos __PUNCT__
social secur we need to strengthen __PUNCT__ but we don't need to turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
and what we also understand is that our prosper at home is connect to our polici abroad __PUNCT__
and so __NUM__ year ago i promis mani of you that i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
and as a new tower rise in new york __PUNCT__ we have gone after al qaida and we got bin laden __PUNCT__
but as we were remind thi past week __PUNCT__ thi is a world still full of seriou threat __PUNCT__
we go to have to work to prevent iran from get a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we go to have to make sure that not onli our diplomat post ar safe __PUNCT__ but we go after folk who threaten or try to kill american __PUNCT__
and that why as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop come home __PUNCT__ we make sure we serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus if you fought for thi countri you shouldn't have to fight for a job when you come home __PUNCT__
my oppon __PUNCT__ he got a differ view __PUNCT__
he said end the war in iraq the wai we did wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ doesn't have a plan to wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and i just got a differ perspect __PUNCT__
i think after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time for us to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let put american back to work __PUNCT__ us the save that we obtain __PUNCT__ to rebuild our road and our bridg and our school __PUNCT__ and lai broadband line into rural commun __PUNCT__
let do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here __PUNCT__
so that the choic we face __PUNCT__
that what the elect is come down to __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ thei keep on sai that tax cut and fewer regul is the onli wai __PUNCT__
thei sai that becaus govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
we got a differ view __PUNCT__
we don't believ in __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ what these gui basic argu __PUNCT__ if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if a compani is pollut the air your children breath __PUNCT__ that the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ borrow some monei from your parent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
we don't think govern can solv everi problem __PUNCT__ but it not the sourc of everi problem __PUNCT__ ani more than all the folk that you hear ar to blame out of washington __PUNCT__ gai or immigr or union __PUNCT__ or corpor __PUNCT__ for that matter __PUNCT__
we don't think that anybodi is sole to blame for the challeng that we face __PUNCT__ but we do believ we all respons to solv those problem __PUNCT__ that we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ that as citizen we accept certain respons not onli for ourselv but also to our commun and our nation __PUNCT__ to make sure that the countri creat more opportun for more peopl __PUNCT__
we understand that america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ but also what done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and as on peopl __PUNCT__
the elect __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ i said in charlott when we were down there __PUNCT__ some of you went to the convent __PUNCT__ i said it wa not about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you __PUNCT__
you were the chang __PUNCT__
you the reason that there a mother in madison or green bai that doesn't have to worri about her son be deni medic coverag becaus of a congenit condit __PUNCT__
you made that happen __PUNCT__
you the reason some student at marquett or univers of wisconsin ha help pai for her colleg __PUNCT__
you the reason a veteran can go to school on the new gi bill __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
you the reason that famili here in wisconsin have gotten a tax cut __PUNCT__ monei thei us to bui groceri and put ga in the car __PUNCT__ pai their bill __PUNCT__
that all becaus of you __PUNCT__
you the reason why some young immigr who ha gone to school here and plai with our kid and sworn allegi to our flag is not go to suddenli be deport from the onli countri she ever known __PUNCT__
you the reason that some outstand soldier can still serv regardless of who thei love becaus we end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
you the reason that famili across america ar abl to sai to their love on who serv us so brave __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
you the reason __PUNCT__
i made thi point down in florida a coupl dai ago __PUNCT__ sai that you can't chang washington just from the insid __PUNCT__
you got to mobil the american peopl __PUNCT__
you chang it with the help of american who ar will to make their voic heard __PUNCT__
my oppon got realli excit __PUNCT__
he thought __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ he quickli rewrot hi speech __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ i get the job done from the insid __PUNCT__
what kind of insid job is he talk about __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ insid job rubberstamp a top __PUNCT__ down agenda from thi republican congress __PUNCT__ we don't want that __PUNCT__
we don't want an insid job where the energi polici ar written by the oil compani __PUNCT__ and health care polici ar written by insur compani __PUNCT__ and our tax code is written by outsourc __PUNCT__
we don't need an insid job where a politician in washington is tell women thei can't make their own health care decis __PUNCT__
we don't need that kind of insid job __PUNCT__
we want to bring chang to washington __PUNCT__
and from the dai we began thi campaign __PUNCT__ but more importantli __PUNCT__ from the dai i ran for thi offic last year __PUNCT__ or __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__
seem like just last year __PUNCT__
i alwai said that chang is go to take more than on term and on __PUNCT__ more than on presid __PUNCT__ and it take more than on parti __PUNCT__
it doesn't happen if you write off half the nation befor you take offic __PUNCT__
