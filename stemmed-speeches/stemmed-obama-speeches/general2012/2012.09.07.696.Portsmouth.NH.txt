he is a wonder __PUNCT__ wonder man __PUNCT__
and last night __PUNCT__ i did my best to lai out the stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ now that both side have made their argument __PUNCT__ there a big choic to make __PUNCT__
and i honestli believ thi is the biggest choic __PUNCT__ the clearest choic __PUNCT__ of ani time in our gener __PUNCT__ becaus it not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
it is a choic between two differ path for america __PUNCT__ two fundament differ vision for how we move forward __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ our is a fight for that basic bargain that built the largest middl class and the strongest economi the world ha ever known __PUNCT__ the promis that hard work will pai off __PUNCT__ that respons will be reward __PUNCT__ that everyon get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi is do their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi is plai by the same rule __PUNCT__ from wall street to main street to washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
that basic bargain is why i ran for presid __PUNCT__ and that why i run again __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that is what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
i mention last night i got my start in servic becaus i work with folk who had been laid off from the steel plant that had close when job start get ship oversea __PUNCT__
and over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we seen that happen more and more and too mani famili struggl with cost that keep rise even when paycheck don't __PUNCT__
so peopl ar have to us their credit card or home equiti loan just to try to make the mortgag or pai tuition or put ga in the car or food on the tabl __PUNCT__
and that debt is why thi hous of card collaps in the great recess __PUNCT__ million of innoc american lose their job and their home __PUNCT__ folk lose their life save __PUNCT__
and we ar fight to recov from that and it a long __PUNCT__ tough journei __PUNCT__
but our friend at the republican convent __PUNCT__ thei talk a lot about what thei thought wa wrong with america __PUNCT__ thei didn't tell you what wa right __PUNCT__
thei didn't tell you what thei do to make it right __PUNCT__
thei want your vote __PUNCT__ but thei don't want to show you their plan __PUNCT__
and that becaus thei know their plan won't sell __PUNCT__
that becaus all thei got to offer is the same prescript that thei had for the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ tax cut __PUNCT__ gut some regul __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ and more tax cut __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ tax cut when time ar good __PUNCT__ tax cut when time ar bad __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__
listen __PUNCT__ i cut tax for peopl who need it __PUNCT__ middl class famili __PUNCT__ small __PUNCT__ busi owner __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis i would cut middl class tax __PUNCT__
the typic famili tax burden is __PUNCT__ feder level __PUNCT__ is __MONEY__ less sinc i took offic __PUNCT__
so i kept that promis __PUNCT__
i kept that promis __PUNCT__
we cut tax for small busi __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
but i do not believ that anoth round of tax break for millionair is what go to bring good job back to our shore or pai down our deficit __PUNCT__
i don't believ fire teacher or kick student off financi aid is go to grow our economi __PUNCT__ not when china is produc more engin and more scientist and we got to compet with them __PUNCT__
after we were on the brink of financi meltdown becaus of irrespons decis made on wall street __PUNCT__ i don't believ that roll back regul there is somehow go to help small __PUNCT__ busi women or businessmen expand or laid __PUNCT__ off construct worker get back to work __PUNCT__
we have been there __PUNCT__
we tri what thei sell __PUNCT__
it didn't work then __PUNCT__ it not go to work now __PUNCT__
we not go back __PUNCT__
we ar move forward __PUNCT__
that why all of you ar here todai __PUNCT__
and i not go to pretend that thi path is quick or easi __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i never have __PUNCT__
as bill clinton remind us on wednesdai night __PUNCT__ it go to take more than a few year for us to solv challeng that were build up over decad __PUNCT__
we know that __PUNCT__
todai we learn that after lose around __NUM__ job a month when i took offic __PUNCT__ busi onc again ad job for the __NUM__ month in a row __PUNCT__ a total of more than __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__
but that not good enough __PUNCT__
we know it not good enough __PUNCT__
we need to creat more job faster __PUNCT__
we need to fill the hole left by thi recess faster __PUNCT__
we need to come out of thi crisi stronger than when we went in __PUNCT__
and there a lot more that we can do __PUNCT__
when congress get back to town next week __PUNCT__ you need to send them a messag __PUNCT__ go ahead and give middl class famili and small busi the confid of know that their tax __PUNCT__ your tax __PUNCT__ will not go up next year __PUNCT__
everybodi agre we shouldn't rais tax on the middl class __PUNCT__ let go ahead and get that done __PUNCT__
let get it done now __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ if the republican ar seriou about be concern about jobless __PUNCT__ we could creat a million new job right now if congress would pass the job plan that i sent to them a year ago __PUNCT__ job for teacher __PUNCT__ job for construct worker __PUNCT__ job for folk who have been look for work for a long time __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__

i ask the entir countri to ralli around a set of goal for our countri __PUNCT__ goal in manufactur __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ nation secur __PUNCT__ and the deficit __PUNCT__
and these __PUNCT__ thi is a real __PUNCT__ achiev plan that will lead to new job and more opportun and rebuild thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
that what we can do in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__ to finish the job __PUNCT__ to keep move forward __PUNCT__ to build up the progress we made __PUNCT__
so let me be a littl more specif __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i got a plan to export more product __PUNCT__ not outsourc job __PUNCT__
after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ thi countri creat over half a million manufactur job in the last 2Â½ year __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
and so now __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__ we have a choic __PUNCT__
we can keep give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that ar invest right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ put american back to work __PUNCT__ sell product around the world __PUNCT__
we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export __PUNCT__
we can creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
you can make that happen __PUNCT__ but i go to need your help __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i got a plan to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we final rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that will save you monei __PUNCT__
we doubl our us of renew energi __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ biofuel __PUNCT__
and ten of thousand of american have job todai becaus thei build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
the other side like to talk about energi __PUNCT__ but thei don't mention that the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
the other side want to revers that progress __PUNCT__
i want to build on it __PUNCT__
i not go to let oil compani dictat the countri energi plan __PUNCT__ and i don't want them to keep collect __MONEY__ billion a year in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__
we want to keep invest in wind and solar and clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
we want to see farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power our car and our truck __PUNCT__
i want construct worker who ar sit at home right now __PUNCT__ i want them build home and factori that wast less energi and retrofit those that ar alreadi built to save energi __PUNCT__
and we can develop a hundr year __PUNCT__ suppli of natur ga right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
if we choos thi path __PUNCT__ we can cut oil import in half by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we can support __NUM__ new job in natur ga develop alon __PUNCT__
that how we move forward __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
let do it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
let do it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ let do it __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ third __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i got even more __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i got a plan to give more american the chanc to gain the skill that thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ __PUNCT__ i would not be stand here if i hadn't gotten a great educ __PUNCT__
michel would not be where she is without the opportun that were given __PUNCT__
and as she told you on tuesdai night __PUNCT__ we didn't come from wealth or fame or power __PUNCT__ but in thi countri __PUNCT__ we alwai made a commit that if you got talent and you will to work hard __PUNCT__ somebodi is go to give you the opportun to get a great educ __PUNCT__ and then you can go as far as your dream can take you __PUNCT__
it is the gatewai to a middl class life in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
so what have we alreadi done __PUNCT__ nearli everi state ha answer our call to rais standard for teach and learn __PUNCT__
some of the worst school in the countri have alreadi seen real gain in math and read __PUNCT__
million of student ar pai less for colleg todai becaus we took on a system where __MONEY__ billion wa go to bank and lender as middlemen for the student loan program __PUNCT__
we said __PUNCT__ let cut out the middleman and give that monei directli to student so that thei get a better deal __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can gut our commit to educ like the other side budget would end up do __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can decid __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ no child should give up her dream becaus a classroom is overcrowd or a school is crumbl __PUNCT__
no famili should set asid that colleg accept letter becaus thei figur thei just can't afford it __PUNCT__
and no compani should be look for the worker thei need oversea becaus thei can't find them here at home __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ new hampshir __PUNCT__ i need you to help me recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher __PUNCT__ and improv earli childhood educ and give __NUM__ million worker the skill thei need at commun colleg and help colleg and univers cut tuition growth in half over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
we can meet these goal togeth __PUNCT__
that the america that we want for our kid __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__ i need __NUM__ more year __PUNCT__ and we go to move forward __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ fourth __PUNCT__ my plan would reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the debt and the deficit ar real medium __PUNCT__ and long __PUNCT__ term problem __PUNCT__ and we go to have to address it __PUNCT__
and i want to get work __PUNCT__
independ analysi show that my plan would cut our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ that with a __PUNCT__ t __PUNCT__
and i work with the republican in congress alreadi to cut __MONEY__ trillion in spend __PUNCT__ and i prepar to do more __PUNCT__
i want to reform our tax code so that it is simpl and fair and so it ask the wealthiest household to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__
so even well __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ do folk would still keep their tax break up to __MONEY__ but after that __PUNCT__ we want to go back to the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
our economi creat __NUM__ million new job then __PUNCT__ we had the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__ we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
we didn't punish success __PUNCT__ we creat an environ for greater success all across the economi __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
my oppon sai he want to reduc the deficit too __PUNCT__
but as wa point out at the convent __PUNCT__ there a basic compon miss from hi plan __PUNCT__ math __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ arithmet __PUNCT__
when governor romnei and hi alli tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spend trillion more on new tax break skew toward the wealthi __PUNCT__ the math doesn't work __PUNCT__
you can't dig yourself a deeper hole __PUNCT__
you can't take __NUM__ trillion out of the treasuri and then sai you go to close it __PUNCT__
and when you ask them __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ how ar you go to do it __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei won't answer real clearli __PUNCT__ but there ar onli a few wai of do it __PUNCT__ and most of them involv stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask student to pai more for colleg or kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__ all so folk like me and mitt romnei can pai less __PUNCT__
i won't turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__
you shouldn't have to spend your golden year at the merci of insur compani after a lifetim of work __PUNCT__
you should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
you earn it __PUNCT__
and so ye __PUNCT__ we need to reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ but we got to do it by reduc the actual cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by dump those cost on to senior who end up pai thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
that not how we go to do it __PUNCT__
and we will keep the promis of social secur by take respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__
but we not go to privat it __PUNCT__
we not turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
we not go to do that __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ rebuild the economi is essenti __PUNCT__
but our prosper at home is link to what we do abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
i said we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__
we have decim al qaida leadership __PUNCT__ and usama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
so now we know __PUNCT__ move forward __PUNCT__ as command in chief __PUNCT__ i will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
we ar go to make sure that we got a strong navi __PUNCT__
and what goe on here in the yard and all across the countri where we got peopl not onli in uniform __PUNCT__ but also folk who ar work __PUNCT__ we got to make sure that thei got the support __PUNCT__
and when our troop take off their uniform __PUNCT__ we go to serv them as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
becaus nobodi who fight for thi countri should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care thei need when thei come home __PUNCT__
my oppon said it wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
i disagre __PUNCT__
he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and while my oppon would spend more monei on militari program that our joint chief even sai won't make us safer and we don't need __PUNCT__ i go to us that monei that we no longer spend on war to help pai down our debt __PUNCT__ and put more peopl back to work rebuild our road and our bridg and our school and our runwai __PUNCT__
becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some more nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__ right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__
so that the choic that we now face __PUNCT__ and that what thi elect come down to __PUNCT__
we keep on get told that bigger tax cut __PUNCT__ fewer regul __PUNCT__ that that the onli path to prosper __PUNCT__ and that govern __PUNCT__ becaus it can't do everyth __PUNCT__ somehow should almost do noth __PUNCT__
i don't believ that __PUNCT__
i don't believ that if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__ that if compani releas toxic pollut into the air that your children breath __PUNCT__ that somehow that a requir for econom growth __PUNCT__
i don't believ that if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ that the best we can do is tell you to borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
we insist on person respons __PUNCT__
we insist on individu initi __PUNCT__
we know we not entitl to success __PUNCT__ we know we got to earn it __PUNCT__
we honor entrepreneur and businesspeopl and striver and dreamer and the risk taker __PUNCT__
we know that that the drive forc behind our free enterpris system __PUNCT__
but we also know that thi countri is built on an idea of citizenship __PUNCT__ the idea that we have some oblig to each other and that when we work togeth we all do better __PUNCT__
we got oblig to futur gener __PUNCT__
that america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ it about what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation and on peopl __PUNCT__
new hampshir __PUNCT__ the elect __NUM__ year ago wasn't about me __PUNCT__
i told you that last night __PUNCT__
it wa about you __PUNCT__
and it sound like mayb you were listen becaus you here __PUNCT__
you were the chang __PUNCT__
you the reason that there a littl girl with a heart disord who will get the surgeri she need becaus now the insur compani can't limit her coverag __PUNCT__
you the reason some young person out there is go to be abl to go to medic school __PUNCT__ becaus now thei can actual afford it __PUNCT__
you made that possibl __PUNCT__
you the reason that a young immigr __PUNCT__ who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag __PUNCT__ is not suddenli go to be deport from the onli home thei ever known __PUNCT__
you the reason why we were abl to end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
you the reason why thousand of famili have been abl to welcom brave troop __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ welcom home __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
and so now you can't turn awai __PUNCT__
we can't turn awai now __PUNCT__
you can't bui into the cynic that chang that we fought so hard for is imposs __PUNCT__
you can't give up on the idea that your vote make a differ __PUNCT__ becaus if you do give up __PUNCT__ then the lobbyist and the special interest __PUNCT__ thei fill the void __PUNCT__ the folk who ar write the __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__ the folk run all these super pac ad __PUNCT__ the folk who want to tell you who you can marri or tell women that thei can't make decis about their own health care __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that who will fill the void if you not in thi __PUNCT__ if you not engag __PUNCT__ if you not focus __PUNCT__ if you not fight __PUNCT__
we go to have to work becaus thi is go to be a close elect __PUNCT__
onli you can make sure that we don't go backward __PUNCT__
onli you have the power to move us forward __PUNCT__
but i ask you to us that power __PUNCT__
i ask you to us that power __PUNCT__
