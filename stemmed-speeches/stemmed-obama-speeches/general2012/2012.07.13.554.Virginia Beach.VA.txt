most of the ad ar neg __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ almost all of the ad ar neg __PUNCT__
and it understand that as you watch these tv ad __PUNCT__ that you start think that polit just doesn't seem to get what go on in your live __PUNCT__ that there so much neg and so much cynic __PUNCT__
and it understand if at a certain point __PUNCT__ peopl just sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ there a disconnect here __PUNCT__ thi is not speak to me __PUNCT__ it not speak to what go on in my neighborhood __PUNCT__ in my commun __PUNCT__
but i just want to remind everybodi that in __NUM__ there were a lot of folk who didn't believ either in the possibl of chang __PUNCT__
there were folk that count us out __PUNCT__ peopl who were sure that a gui name barack obama could not be elect presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and what we __PUNCT__ and so the reason we came togeth wa not becaus we thought it wa a sure thing __PUNCT__ it wa becaus we share a set of valu __PUNCT__
we believ in the basic bargain that ha been the bedrock of thi nation for well over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and i wa think as i wa about to come out about thi __PUNCT__ which will be my last campaign __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ there a term limit thing in the presid __PUNCT__
thi isn't like congress __PUNCT__ i can't just keep on run __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but it made me think about my first campaign __PUNCT__ my earliest campaign __PUNCT__ and the reason i got into polit in the first place __PUNCT__
some of you know my grandpar were part of that world war ii __PUNCT__ great depress gener __PUNCT__
and my grandfath fought in patton armi and my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when my grandfath came back __PUNCT__ at that point my mom had been born __PUNCT__ he wa abl to go to colleg becaus of the gi bill __PUNCT__
and thei were abl to bui their first home with some help from the fha __PUNCT__
and then my mother __PUNCT__ she wa a singl mom __PUNCT__ my dad left befor i even rememb him __PUNCT__
but she wa still abl to give me and my sister thi unbeliev educ __PUNCT__ becaus of scholarship and grant and the fact that she wa will to work hard so that she could work and go to school at the same time and rais two kid __PUNCT__
and then i think about michel famili __PUNCT__
her dad __PUNCT__ he wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__ work at the water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__
and even though he had ms __PUNCT__ so he __PUNCT__ by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he couldn't realli walk __PUNCT__
he had to us two cane __PUNCT__
and he have to wake up an hour earli __PUNCT__ earlier than everybodi els __PUNCT__ to get to work __PUNCT__ just to put on hi cloth and get readi for work __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai work __PUNCT__
and michel mom __PUNCT__ she stai at home and look after michel and her brother until thei got older __PUNCT__ and then work as a secretari most of her life __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ despit these modest begin __PUNCT__ michel and her brother craig could go to the best school on earth __PUNCT__ and rise up to do extraordinari thing __PUNCT__
so in my first campaign __PUNCT__ when i thought about why am i get into polit __PUNCT__ the reason wa becaus we __PUNCT__ my famili __PUNCT__ michel famili __PUNCT__ we had benefit from thi basic american bargain __PUNCT__
thi idea __PUNCT__ at the heart of thi nation __PUNCT__ that if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ if you ar will to take respons __PUNCT__ then you ar not constrain by the circumst of your birth __PUNCT__
you can go as far as your dream can take you __PUNCT__
if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that support a famili __PUNCT__
and you can have a home to call your own __PUNCT__
and you won't be bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
and even if you weren't born into wealth __PUNCT__ you can make sure your kid get a great educ and go on to colleg __PUNCT__
mayb you can take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__
i wa up in ohio talk about my favorit vacat __PUNCT__
when i wa __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ my grandmoth __PUNCT__ my mother __PUNCT__ my sister and me __PUNCT__ we travel the countri __PUNCT__ but we didn't do it on jet __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we took greyhound and the train __PUNCT__ and i think twice we rent a car __PUNCT__
and we stai at howard johnson __PUNCT__
and if there wa a pool somewher __PUNCT__ no matter __PUNCT__ it could look like a puddl it could be so small __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i wa so excit __PUNCT__
and you go to the ic machin and the vend machin __PUNCT__ i wa __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ that wa a big deal fill up that bucket of ic and get that soda __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the point wa that your vacat didn't have to be fanci __PUNCT__
it just gave you a sens of how you could spend time with each other __PUNCT__
that wa part of that american dream __PUNCT__
and then the notion that you could retir with digniti and respect after a lifetim of work __PUNCT__
that the idea that got me into polit __PUNCT__ becaus my feel wa __PUNCT__ given how much thi countri had given me and given michel __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that that same bargain held for the next gener __PUNCT__ that it wasn't just about me __PUNCT__ it wa about make sure that everi american had those same opportun __PUNCT__
and the interest thing is __PUNCT__ when i first start run for the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__ let sai __PUNCT__ in illinoi __PUNCT__ and i be drive around and we go to downstat illinoi and small farm town __PUNCT__ or sometim we be in the big citi like chicago __PUNCT__ no matter who you met __PUNCT__ thei had those same stori in their background __PUNCT__
black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ it didn't matter __PUNCT__ thei rememb their parent or their grandpar or great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ some of them immigr __PUNCT__ some of them brought here not by choic __PUNCT__ but each success gener believ that thi union could be perfect and that if thei realli work hard and were abl to overcom whatev barrier in their wai __PUNCT__ that thei could succe __PUNCT__
so i ran in __NUM__ becaus i felt that that bargain wasn't reach enough peopl __PUNCT__
and the reason so mani of you support me in __NUM__ wa becaus you understood that that dream wa slip awai for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that we had gone through a decad in which wage and incom weren't go up no matter how hard you work __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from colleg to health care to groceri to ga kept on go up and peopl worri that mayb their kid might not do as well as thei did __PUNCT__ when the idea wa alwai that your kid do better than you do __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and so that what brought us togeth __PUNCT__
the campaign in __NUM__ wa not about a singl candid __PUNCT__
it wasn't about me __PUNCT__
it wa about us and our desir to make sure that the american dream continu for the next gener and the gener after that and the gener after that __PUNCT__
and what __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ what we didn't realiz at the time wa we were about to confront the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ million of peopl thrown out of work __PUNCT__ folk lose the valu of their home __PUNCT__
and so in some wai __PUNCT__ that dream seem even further awai __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ we work hard over the last 3½ year to try to restor that belief that in thi countri you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
and that how we were abl to save an auto industri __PUNCT__
when some said let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ we said we go to bet on american worker and american industri __PUNCT__ and now gm is back on top __PUNCT__ and ford and chrysler ar sell car __PUNCT__ becaus we believ in that american promis __PUNCT__
busi start get back to basic __PUNCT__ and we now creat more than __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ manufactur job creat dure thi time __PUNCT__
we seen all across the countri folk who got laid off retrain __PUNCT__ go back to a commun colleg and be abl to find a new job in a new industri __PUNCT__ small busi struggl __PUNCT__ sometim keep their door open even though thei not take a salari becaus thei know their employe depend on them and their famili depend on them __PUNCT__
it turn out that america is tougher than ani tough time __PUNCT__
but what we also understand is we still got more work to do __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ the reason i ran and the reason you support me wasn't just to get back to where we were in __NUM__ the reason we came togeth wa to restor that promis for middl class famili and all who ar strive to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
that what we fight for __PUNCT__
and we got a lot more work to do on that front __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i got to tell you __PUNCT__ thi elect in some wai is go to be more import than __NUM__ becaus after 3½ year of not get much help from the other side __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think what fair to sai is __PUNCT__ is that we now have a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
solv our problem __PUNCT__ make sure that good job ar creat here in the unit state __PUNCT__ make sure that those good job pai and have basic benefit __PUNCT__ make sure that we bring down our deficit in a respons wai __PUNCT__ make sure that we maintain cut __PUNCT__ edg industri here in the unit state __PUNCT__ make sure we got the best educ system possibl __PUNCT__ we know how to do those thing __PUNCT__
what hold us back is not an absenc of new idea __PUNCT__ it not a lack of solut __PUNCT__
it the fact that there ar two fundament differ vision about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and so thi elect is about more than just two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__
thi is about which direct we take thi nation __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the other side __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
romnei and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei got a veri particular idea about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and it basic involv take the countri back __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
their econom idea __PUNCT__ you can summar it realli easili __PUNCT__
thei basic want to give __MONEY__ trillion in new tax cut __PUNCT__ mostli for the wealthi __PUNCT__ on top of the bush tax cut even if it mean gut invest in educ __PUNCT__ even if it mean gut invest in basic research __PUNCT__ even if it mean that we not rebuild america infrastructur __PUNCT__ even if it start cut into benefit that we provid to our veteran __PUNCT__
the basic idea is that if you help folk at the top __PUNCT__ at the veri top __PUNCT__ and if you elimin regul that we put in place to make sure bank can't just do whatev thei want __PUNCT__ or consum aren't cheat by their credit card compani __PUNCT__ or insur compani can't take advantag of their custom __PUNCT__ elimin those regul __PUNCT__ cut tax at the veri top __PUNCT__ that somehow __PUNCT__ all those benefit ar go to trickl down on you __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that the economi is go to improv and you ar go to benefit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i have to tell you __PUNCT__ i think thei wrong __PUNCT__
and the reason i think thei wrong __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ is becaus we tri it __PUNCT__
we tri it for most of the last decad __PUNCT__
and what were the result __PUNCT__ we end up turn record surplus into record deficit __PUNCT__
wage __PUNCT__ incom stagnat __PUNCT__
job growth sluggish __PUNCT__
and it culmin in the worst financi crisi that we seen sinc the 1930 __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you try someth and it doesn't work __PUNCT__ why would you try it again __PUNCT__ why would we want to go back to that __PUNCT__ i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
i don't think top __PUNCT__ down econom work __PUNCT__
i believ that we grow thi economi from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
i believ the heart and soul of thi countri is make sure that work peopl can feel some secur in the middl class and we grow our middl class and we go back to that basic american bargain that sai everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
that what i believ __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you want a specif exampl of the differ between my approach __PUNCT__ my vision __PUNCT__ our vision __PUNCT__ and the other side version __PUNCT__ let look at the debat we have about tax right now __PUNCT__
i have cut tax for middl class famili by an averag of __MONEY__ sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__
becaus my attitud wa work peopl were the on who were hurt most sever by the crisi __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ if thei got a tax break __PUNCT__ thei were most like to spend that monei for necess and put it back into circul __PUNCT__ and that would do the most for the economi __PUNCT__
so just in case some of your friend or neighbor __PUNCT__ or uncl jim __PUNCT__ who a littl stubborn and been watch fox new __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and he think that somehow i rais tax __PUNCT__ let just be clear __PUNCT__ we lower tax for middl class famili sinc i came into offic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ what i said is that the wai the law is set up right now __PUNCT__ if we do noth __PUNCT__ on __DATE__ everybodi tax go up __PUNCT__
everybodi incom tax go up on __DATE__ if congress doe noth __PUNCT__
so what i said is now is not the time to rais tax on the middl class __PUNCT__
the economi is still fragil __PUNCT__
we still dig ourselv out of thi hole __PUNCT__
so let provid certainti to __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__
nineti __PUNCT__ eight percent of american make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ let sai to that __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ your tax will not go up __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ thi is the first __MONEY__ of incom __PUNCT__ which mean that even millionair would get a littl tax break becaus for their first __MONEY__ their tax wouldn't go up __PUNCT__
the republican sai thei agre that middl class tax should not go up __PUNCT__
that my belief __PUNCT__
so what i said is if we both agre that middl class tax shouldn't go up __PUNCT__ let go ahead and get thi done tomorrow __PUNCT__
let get thi done next week __PUNCT__
what the holdup __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ it turn out that the holdup is we got a disagr on the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ folk like me __PUNCT__ we don't need a tax break __PUNCT__
and it turn out if you give us a tax break along with the __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that cost about a trillion dollar __PUNCT__
we alreadi benefit from most of the tax cut over the last decad __PUNCT__ so we don't need it __PUNCT__ we least like to spend it __PUNCT__
it least like to give a boost to the economi __PUNCT__
we can't afford it becaus we try to bring down our deficit and try to control our debt __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the republican disagre with me on thi __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei disagre with me on thi __PUNCT__
and my attitud is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that fine __PUNCT__ but let not hold middl class folk hostag __PUNCT__
the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ those tax cut __PUNCT__ that will be settl in the next elect __PUNCT__
and i look forward to have a debat __PUNCT__ becaus if you sai you want to bring down the deficit __PUNCT__ but you not will to let tax cut laps for the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ it tell me you not seriou about deficit reduct __PUNCT__
but we can have that debat __PUNCT__
but in the meantim __PUNCT__ let go ahead and help middl class famili right now __PUNCT__
and so far __PUNCT__ i have not gotten an okai from the other side on that __PUNCT__
and that tell me i guess thei not that seriou about deficit reduct __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
those folk let him down __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ but thi is just an exampl of their broader theori __PUNCT__
thei think that if you just help wealthi investor __PUNCT__ it help everybodi __PUNCT__
i think the opposit __PUNCT__
let take small busi __PUNCT__
i cut small busi tax __NUM__ time sinc i been in offic __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__
so for __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__ thei also benefit if we went ahead and got that done right now __PUNCT__
so far __PUNCT__ thei haven't taken me up on thi offer __PUNCT__
but what thi show is the differ in philosophi __PUNCT__ becaus i believ that if you do well __PUNCT__ then the countri doe well __PUNCT__
i believ if the small busi person and the teacher and the construct worker and the firefight and all those folk who put in a hard dai work everi dai __PUNCT__ if thei do well __PUNCT__ then everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that my vision for america __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to make sure that everi young person in america ha a great educ __PUNCT__
i got a plan to hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
we alreadi expand the pell grant program to help make colleg more afford __PUNCT__ provid tax credit to middl class famili to help make colleg more afford __PUNCT__
i want to keep on go and make sure that __NUM__ million more peopl can go to commun colleg to get train in the job that exist right now and lower colleg tuition cost __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i run becaus i believ we should have manufactur job creat here in the unit state __PUNCT__
i don't think the auto industri is uniqu __PUNCT__ i think there ar a whole bunch of compani who we can attract back to the unit state __PUNCT__
but we go to have to chang our tax code and stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__
give those tax break to compani that ar move back here to the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ make product stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus there ar a lot of folk in virginia who have serv us in uniform with such braveri and dedic and patriot __PUNCT__ and i want us to keep faith with our troop and make sure that our fundingveteran get the benefit that thei have earn and that militari famili like ricki ar get the help that thei need when their love on ar fight on our behalf __PUNCT__
but part of keep faith is also make sure that we got a smart nation secur strategi __PUNCT__
and it also mean make sure that we got a strong economi to support a strong militari __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis we would end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we end it __PUNCT__
we ar transit in afghanistan and begin to bring our troop home from that theater __PUNCT__
we have gone after al qaida __PUNCT__ decim their leadership rank __PUNCT__ taken out osama bin laden __PUNCT__
so now i think it a good time for us to take half of those save that we gotten from wind down these war __PUNCT__ us half of it to pai for the deficit __PUNCT__ us the other half to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let put american back to work rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ build broadband line into rural area __PUNCT__ make sure that we got the best airport and the best rail line in the world __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ becaus i want to rebuild america and put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ u.s.a __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to build not just the best energi polici in the world here in the unit state __PUNCT__ i also want us to take the lead in clean energi __PUNCT__
we seen oil product go up __PUNCT__
we see natur ga product go up __PUNCT__
and we doubl our invest and product in solar and wind and biodiesel __PUNCT__
i don't want us to be depend on what happen in the middl east for our energi __PUNCT__
i want us to develop homegrown energi __PUNCT__
i want us to stop give tax subsidi to oil compani that ar alreadi incred profit __PUNCT__
i want to doubl down on our invest in clean energi that never been more promis __PUNCT__ in solar and wind and biodiesel __PUNCT__ and put peopl back to work so that we can free ourselv from depend on foreign oil and build up america __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
and i run so that we bring down our deficit and our debt in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
we alreadi made a lot of tough cut to the feder govern __PUNCT__ and i prepar to do more __PUNCT__
i don't believ that everi govern program work __PUNCT__
i don't believ that govern is the answer for everi problem __PUNCT__
we not go to improv our school unless our parent ar focus on educ __PUNCT__
american can't be look for handout __PUNCT__
there ar some folk you can't help if thei not will to help themselv __PUNCT__
but what i also believ is __PUNCT__ is that there ar some invest like in educ __PUNCT__ or in basic research __PUNCT__ or in transport __PUNCT__ there ar basic invest we need to make to grow our economi __PUNCT__
and so if we go to bring down our deficit in a sensibl wai that grow the economi and grow our middl class __PUNCT__ it can't be base simpli on cut to basic program and ask noth from those who have been the most fortun in thi societi __PUNCT__
so what i said is we make cut __PUNCT__ but we also go to ask the wealthiest american like me to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
and i promis you __PUNCT__ we can afford it __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the last time we did that __PUNCT__ it work __PUNCT__
bill clinton did it __PUNCT__ and we end up have __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__
we went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole bunch of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
so don't tell me that that go to destroi job __PUNCT__
that go to creat job becaus we do it in a wai that focus on build the middl class __PUNCT__
and there ar a whole bunch of wealthi american who understand that and ar will to do the right thing if thei ask __PUNCT__
and i prepar to ask them __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so we got a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
we got a lot of work to do __PUNCT__
and the wai we go to get it done is by you make a decis __PUNCT__
there mai be some __PUNCT__ there ar peopl who agre with mr __PUNCT__ romnei and hi alli in congress __PUNCT__
