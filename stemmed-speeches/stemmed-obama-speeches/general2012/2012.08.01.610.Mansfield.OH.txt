it a choic not just between two candid or two parti __PUNCT__ but more than ani elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ vision for america __PUNCT__ two fundament differ path that we should __PUNCT__ that we could be go down __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
love you __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i appreci that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ the direct that we choos __PUNCT__ the direct you choos when you walk into thi vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ is go to have a direct impact on your live __PUNCT__ but also on your children live and your grandchildren live __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ as democrat __PUNCT__ but also independ and some republican __PUNCT__ to restor the basic bargain that built the greatest middl class and the most prosper countri the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and it a bargain that i live in my life and so mani of you have experienc __PUNCT__
it the basic idea that sai here in thi countri __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ that work should be reward __PUNCT__
if you act respons __PUNCT__ you should be abl to get ahead __PUNCT__
it a deal that sai if we put in enough effort __PUNCT__ we should be abl to find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
we should be abl to afford a home that we call our own __PUNCT__
we should have health care that we can count on if we get sick __PUNCT__
we should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ we should be abl to give our children the kind of educ that allow them to dream even bigger and do even better than we ever imagin __PUNCT__
that what we believ __PUNCT__
it a simpl american promis __PUNCT__
it at the __PUNCT__ a core of the american dream __PUNCT__
and we knew that restor it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__ we knew it would take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
and that wa befor the middl class wa hammer by the worst econom crisi of our lifetim __PUNCT__ a crisi that rob too mani of our friend and our neighbor of their home __PUNCT__ their job __PUNCT__ their save and push the american dream even further out of reach for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ there on thing that that crisi did not chang __PUNCT__
it did not chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it did not chang the american charact __PUNCT__
it did not chang what made us great __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang why we came togeth to do what we did in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it just made our mission more urgent __PUNCT__
our first order of busi is to recov all the job and wealth that wa lost in the crisi __PUNCT__
and we made stride these last 3Â½ year to get that done __PUNCT__
but beyond that __PUNCT__ we here to reclaim that financi secur that been slip awai for more than a decad __PUNCT__
the decad befor i came into offic __PUNCT__ your incom and wage gener weren't go up __PUNCT__ job were move oversea __PUNCT__ the auto industri had been get hammer __PUNCT__
so our job is not just to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
it also to build an economi where __PUNCT__ over the long haul __PUNCT__ that work pai off __PUNCT__ so that no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ or what you look like __PUNCT__ or where you come from __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mansfield __PUNCT__ there ar no quick fix or easi solut to the challeng we face __PUNCT__
but there no doubt in my mind __PUNCT__ we got the capac to meet them __PUNCT__
think about everyth that we have go for us here in america __PUNCT__
we got the best worker __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist __PUNCT__
we got the best research __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg __PUNCT__ best univers __PUNCT__
we got a buckey gui right here __PUNCT__
we a young nation __PUNCT__ with great divers of talent and ingenu __PUNCT__
peopl come here __PUNCT__ want to come here __PUNCT__ from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay tell us __PUNCT__ no matter how dark the other side tri to make thing look __PUNCT__ there is not anoth countri on earth that wouldn't gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so what stand in our wai is not that we don't have the ingredi to make the __NUM__ centuri the american centuri just like the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the problem we got right now is our polit __PUNCT__ the sort of uncompromis view __PUNCT__ the notion that we should be go back to what we were do that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__ instead of go forward to achiev a brighter american futur __PUNCT__
it the old __PUNCT__ it that old top __PUNCT__ down econom that we been hear about for year __PUNCT__ the old __PUNCT__ discredit idea that if we somehow get rid of more regul on big corpor and give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ that somehow that go to lead to more job and prosper for everybodi __PUNCT__
ohio __PUNCT__ you know better __PUNCT__
i know better __PUNCT__
we know thi countri wasn't built from the top down __PUNCT__
it wa built by the middl class __PUNCT__
it wa built by farmer and factori worker and startup and small busi and compani that sent american product oversea __PUNCT__ not send american job oversea __PUNCT__
that what built ohio __PUNCT__ and that what built america __PUNCT__
and that what we fight for __PUNCT__
that what we fight for right now __PUNCT__
that the economi we need to build togeth __PUNCT__
and i promis you __PUNCT__ we will not get there if we adopt these idea that somehow spend more monei on tax cut for millionair and billionair who don't need them and aren't even ask for them is actual go to improv the economi __PUNCT__
we tri that __PUNCT__ it did not work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ despit the evid __PUNCT__ the entir centerpiec of my oppon econom plan is a new __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion tax cut on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the bulk of thi tax cut would go to the veri top __PUNCT__
a lot of it would go to the wealthiest __NUM__ percent of all household __PUNCT__
folk make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__ the top on __PUNCT__ tenth of on percent __PUNCT__ would get a tax cut worth almost a quarter of a million dollar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ think about that __PUNCT__
folk make __MONEY__ million a year or more would get a quarter __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ million __PUNCT__ dollar tax cut __PUNCT__
but listen __PUNCT__ it get wors __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ under my oppon plan __PUNCT__ who do you think get the bill for these __MONEY__ tax cut __PUNCT__ you do __PUNCT__
and you do not have to take my word for it __PUNCT__
just todai an independ __PUNCT__ nonpartisan organ ran all the number on governor romnei plan __PUNCT__
thi wasn't my staff __PUNCT__ thi wasn't someth we did __PUNCT__ independ group ran the number __PUNCT__
thei found that if governor romnei want to keep hi word and pai for thi plan __PUNCT__ then he have to cut tax break that middl class famili depend on to pai for your home __PUNCT__ the home mortgag deduct __PUNCT__ to pai for your health care __PUNCT__ the health care deduct __PUNCT__ to send your kid to colleg __PUNCT__
that mean the averag middl class famili with children __PUNCT__ accord to thi studi __PUNCT__ would be hit with a tax increas of more than __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__
he not ask you to contribut more to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__
he not ask you to pai more to invest in our children educ or rebuild our road or put more folk back to work __PUNCT__
he ask you to pai more so that peopl like him can get a big tax cut __PUNCT__
in order to afford just on __MONEY__ tax cut for somebodi like mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ __NUM__ famili like your would have to pai anoth __MONEY__ in tax each and everi year __PUNCT__
doe that sound like a good plan for econom growth __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__

all we ask peopl like me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei to do is go back to the rate we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and i don't know if you rememb __PUNCT__ that when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__
and here the kicker __PUNCT__ it actual creat a lot of millionair __PUNCT__ becaus when the middl class is do well __PUNCT__ then our busi do well __PUNCT__
when folk have monei to spend __PUNCT__ thei bui a new car __PUNCT__ and the car compani do well __PUNCT__ and thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
when you got some extra monei in your pocket __PUNCT__ then you go get some pizza from brenda __PUNCT__
