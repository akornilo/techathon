audienc member __PUNCT__
i love you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i love you back __PUNCT__
there she is __PUNCT__
so thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__ and it got me a littl nostalg __PUNCT__
so i start think about some of my earli campaign __PUNCT__ when i wa run for the state senat __PUNCT__ when i wa run for u. __PUNCT__ senat back in my home state of illinoi __PUNCT__
some illinoisan in the hous __PUNCT__
and illinoi is a lot like virginia becaus it incred divers __PUNCT__
you got big citi __PUNCT__ you got small town __PUNCT__
there ar farm commun __PUNCT__ there ar suburban commun __PUNCT__
folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ you name it __PUNCT__
and as i wa travel around in those first campaign __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ back then i wa do my own drive __PUNCT__ and there wa no mapquest __PUNCT__ so you had to get the old map __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that you couldn't figur out how to fold back __PUNCT__ and i get lost all the time __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and sometim __PUNCT__ i get to an event __PUNCT__ and i have to find a park spot __PUNCT__ and that would take a while __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ i be come in late __PUNCT__
but what inspir me so much in that first race wa the fact that no matter where i went __PUNCT__ there wa a certain common thread __PUNCT__ a certain common theme __PUNCT__ a certain set of stori that were consist in everi commun __PUNCT__
and those stori remind me of my own famili stori __PUNCT__
so i meet an elderli veteran __PUNCT__ and i think back to my grandpar __PUNCT__
my grandfath fought in world war ii __PUNCT__ and while he wa awai __PUNCT__ my grandmoth __PUNCT__ in addit to look after my mom who had just been born __PUNCT__ also work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when my grandfath came back __PUNCT__ he wa abl to go to colleg becaus of the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to afford their first home through an fha loan __PUNCT__
and sometim __PUNCT__ i travel __PUNCT__ and i meet a singl mom __PUNCT__ and that would remind me of my mother __PUNCT__ who had to rais me and my sister pretti much on her own __PUNCT__ with the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__ becaus my father had left __PUNCT__
she didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ but she wa abl to work and go to school at the same time and help other peopl through her work and then ultim give me and my sister the best educ thi world ha to offer __PUNCT__
and then sometim __PUNCT__ i be talk to some work folk __PUNCT__ and i think about michel famili __PUNCT__
her dad wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__ he work at the water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__
and he had ms __PUNCT__ so by the time i met him __PUNCT__ he could bare walk __PUNCT__
he had to us two cane __PUNCT__
and he had to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els to get to the job __PUNCT__
it took him that long to get dress and get readi __PUNCT__
but he never miss a dai of work __PUNCT__
and michel mom __PUNCT__ after stai at home for a while __PUNCT__ she work as a secretari __PUNCT__
and thei live in a small apart abov a hous that somebodi els own __PUNCT__
but somehow thei were abl to give michel and her brother thi incred educ so thei could achiev dream that thei wouldn't have even imagin __PUNCT__
and so the point is that dure thi campaign __PUNCT__ dure all the campaign i run __PUNCT__ what i alwai been move by __PUNCT__ what alwai inspir me is that at the center of our stori is thi basic american idea __PUNCT__ thi core american dream __PUNCT__ that sai __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ like no other __PUNCT__ if you ar will to work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
if you will to meet your respons to not onli yourself and your famili __PUNCT__ but to your commun and your countri __PUNCT__ you can enjoi the secur of a middl class life __PUNCT__
and that not a matter of how much is in your bank account __PUNCT__
it mean that you can find a job that support a famili __PUNCT__
it mean that you can get a home to call your own __PUNCT__
it mean you not bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
it mean mayb you can take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__ noth fanci __PUNCT__ but you have the chanc to spend time with your famili and enjoi their compani __PUNCT__
it mean that you can send your kid to a good school __PUNCT__ and if thei will to work hard __PUNCT__ thei can get a great educ and go on as far as their dream take them __PUNCT__
and it mean that you can retir with some digniti and some respect __PUNCT__
it that basic bargain that make thi countri great __PUNCT__
it that basic bargain that built the econom superpow that we ar todai __PUNCT__
it that basic bargain that made us the envi of the world __PUNCT__
and what i think we all understood back in __NUM__ wa that for almost a decad __PUNCT__ that dream felt like it wa slip awai __PUNCT__
for too mani peopl __PUNCT__ harder work didn't result in higher incom or higher wage __PUNCT__
for too mani peopl __PUNCT__ thei saw their cost of health care or colleg or ga or groceri go up and up and up __PUNCT__ while basic what thei were bring in stai stagnant or even went down __PUNCT__
and so we came togeth __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ but republican and independ too __PUNCT__ becaus we not democrat of republican first __PUNCT__ we american first __PUNCT__
so we came togeth to fight for that american idea __PUNCT__
we understood that we had to bring about a chang __PUNCT__ becaus we understood that the economi work in thi countri when it work for everybodi __PUNCT__ not just for the few __PUNCT__
but look __PUNCT__ we knew that turn thi thing around wasn't go to be easi __PUNCT__
the challeng we face __PUNCT__ the roadblock __PUNCT__ the barrier for middl class famili __PUNCT__ thei hadn't arisen overnight __PUNCT__ thei weren't go to be solv overnight __PUNCT__
we knew that it wa go to take probabl more than __NUM__ year or on term or mayb even on presid __PUNCT__
but we were will to try __PUNCT__
we want to get start __PUNCT__
and so what we didn't understand __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ wa some of the problem had been build up so much that we end up see the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and that crisi ha result in million of peopl lose their job and home valu declin and folk have a tough time __PUNCT__
and for the last 3Â½ year __PUNCT__ we have fought back __PUNCT__ to creat __NUM__ million new job and __NUM__ new manufactur job __PUNCT__ to start right the ship so we can start move in the right direct __PUNCT__
but we got so much more work to do __PUNCT__
here the good new __PUNCT__ for all these tough time __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar tougher __PUNCT__
peopl mai have gotten knock down __PUNCT__ but thei gotten back up __PUNCT__
what ha not chang sinc __NUM__ is the charact of thi countri __PUNCT__ the charact of it peopl __PUNCT__
and so our mission now is the same mission that we had in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ it to get peopl back to work right awai and to solv some of these hous problem right awai __PUNCT__ but it also __PUNCT__ how do we build an economi that last and work for everybodi __PUNCT__ how do we build an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__ whether you start a busi or punch a clock __PUNCT__ you know that if you put in the effort __PUNCT__ you get ahead __PUNCT__ that what thi campaign is about __PUNCT__
that what my presid ha been about __PUNCT__
we got more work to do __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai thi __PUNCT__
it popular sometim among some pundit to sai __PUNCT__ or comment to sai __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ mayb america best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__
i don't believ that __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we remain the most power countri on earth by far __PUNCT__
we got all the ingredi to make the __NUM__ centuri the american centuri just like the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
the problem we have is not a lack of solut __PUNCT__ it not good idea __PUNCT__
the problem we have right now is we got a stalem in washington __PUNCT__
and thi stalem is not just a differ between two candid or even two polit parti __PUNCT__ it is a __PUNCT__ it repres two fundament differ idea about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
my oppon and hi congression alli __PUNCT__ thei believ in what i call top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
their basic view is that if we cut tax trillion of dollar __PUNCT__ mostli for those at the veri top __PUNCT__ even if it mean cut educ fund __PUNCT__ even if it mean cut basic research __PUNCT__ even if it mean underfund our infrastructur __PUNCT__ and even if it mean make medicar a voucher system __PUNCT__ that somehow that go to be good for everybodi __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so that on big part of their idea __PUNCT__ is you cut tax for folk at the top __PUNCT__
their second big idea is if you elimin regul on oil compani or insur compani or credit card compani or pollut __PUNCT__ that somehow that will free up the engin of growth __PUNCT__
so those ar basic their two __PUNCT__ those ar the onli two idea thei have __PUNCT__
don't take my word for it __PUNCT__
go on their web site __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ look at the republican budget in the hous of repres __PUNCT__
that their basic approach __PUNCT__
thei believ that somehow all these benefit ar go to trickl down if we just implement their plan __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there noth wrong with have an idea __PUNCT__ a theori __PUNCT__ and test it out __PUNCT__
here the thing __PUNCT__ we test it out for almost a decad __PUNCT__
we tri thi befor __PUNCT__
and guess what __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ it did not work __PUNCT__
we tri almost exactli what thei ar propos __PUNCT__ and here ar the result __PUNCT__ we went from surplus to deficit __PUNCT__
we had the most sluggish job growth in decad __PUNCT__
the averag incom of middl class famili actual went down __PUNCT__
and it culmin in thi mess that we ar still dig ourselv out from under __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ normal __PUNCT__ in your own live __PUNCT__ if you do someth over and over again and it doesn't work __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ at some point you decid __PUNCT__ let try someth new __PUNCT__
so we don't need more top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
i believ in a middl __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__ a bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
i believ that when hard __PUNCT__ work american ar do well __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
that been our histori __PUNCT__
that been the evid __PUNCT__
that why i ran for presid __PUNCT__ to fight on behalf of the middl class and those who ar strive to get in to the middl class __PUNCT__
and that why i run again for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
so let just take a few exampl of the contrast between their approach and what i propos __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ my oppon said __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker and american ingenu __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ gm is number on again __PUNCT__
chrysler is sell car again __PUNCT__
ford is on the move __PUNCT__
the u. __PUNCT__ auto industri ha come roar back __PUNCT__
and what happen in the auto industri i want to see happen in manufactur all across thi countri __PUNCT__ right here in virginia __PUNCT__
we invest in advanc manufactur becaus we want to beat out countri like germani and china __PUNCT__
i want the great invent to be done here __PUNCT__ and i want great new product creat here __PUNCT__ which is why __PUNCT__ and thi is anoth contrast __PUNCT__ wherea my oppon __PUNCT__ in hi privat busi __PUNCT__ wa invest in compani that the washington post call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__ i believ in insourc __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give those tax break that ar invest right here in virginia __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ hire american worker to make american product to sell around the world __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i run becaus __PUNCT__ after a decad of war __PUNCT__ i said we were go to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
thank to the incred effort of our brave men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ thank to our veteran and their sacrific __PUNCT__ we been abl to decim al qaida leadership __PUNCT__ bin laden is no more __PUNCT__
we transit out of afghanistan __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ after a decad of war __PUNCT__ i think it a good time for us to take half the monei that we save __PUNCT__ that us to be spent on war __PUNCT__ to pai down our deficit __PUNCT__ and let take the other half and rebuild america __PUNCT__ do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
let rebuild our infrastructur __PUNCT__
let rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__
northern virginia know a littl bit about traffic __PUNCT__
let build broadband line and high speed rail __PUNCT__
let expand our port and improv our airport __PUNCT__
that what go to keep us at the cut __PUNCT__ edg of a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
and we got ten of thousand of construct worker readi to be put back to work __PUNCT__
why wouldn't we do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ thi is a disagr i got with the gui who lead the other parti __PUNCT__
that the choic that we got to make __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that the unit state ha the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
i want to hire new __PUNCT__ outstand teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
we alreadi done work to make colleg more afford by make sure that your student loan rate didn't doubl __PUNCT__ those student who ar here __PUNCT__ by provid tuition tax credit that have save million of famili thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ by expand the pell grant __PUNCT__
but now i want to actual reduc the cost of colleg so young peopl aren't come out with thousand of dollar worth of debt __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american the chanc to attend commun colleg and get the technic train thei need to get the job that ar be creat right now here in virginia and around america __PUNCT__
becaus in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a higher educ __PUNCT__ i don't care whether it a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ or a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ or a postdoc __PUNCT__ or whatev it is __PUNCT__ an advanc degre beyond high school __PUNCT__ that not a luxuri __PUNCT__ that an econom necess __PUNCT__
that what our young peopl deserv __PUNCT__
that what i intend to give them __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i run to continu to strengthen our hous market __PUNCT__ which ha been on of the biggest drag on our economi __PUNCT__
so i told congress __PUNCT__ let creat an opportun where everi american can refin their home and take advantag of histor low rate __PUNCT__
it would save the averag famili __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
my oppon plan is to let the foreclosur plai themselv out and let the market hit bottom __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that not a plan __PUNCT__
that not a solut __PUNCT__
that a problem __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but that a differ in our approach __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei think that i made a bad decis by repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
i think you should be abl to fight for your countri regardless of whom you love __PUNCT__
my oppon want to restrict the health care option for women __PUNCT__
i believ women should make their own health care choic __PUNCT__
my oppon believ that we should have our immigr in thi countri __PUNCT__ if thei were kid and were brought here through no fault of their own and ar american in everi respect except a piec of paper __PUNCT__ that somehow we shouldn't show them the kind of compass that we would show our own kid __PUNCT__
i disagre __PUNCT__
i think we should have comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__ becaus we a nation of immigr and a nation of law __PUNCT__ and we can have tough border secur and improv our immigr system __PUNCT__ but when i look out at what happen in virginia __PUNCT__ our immigr is a strength not a weak __PUNCT__
that a differ __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei want to repeal the afford care act __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just sai that i pass thi bill becaus it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar implement thi law __PUNCT__
if you got health insur __PUNCT__ the onli thing that happen for you is that you got more secur __PUNCT__ becaus insur compani can't jerk you around and us fine print to somehow restrict your care __PUNCT__
if you a young person __PUNCT__ you can stai on your parent plan up until you __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
senior ar see lower cost for their prescript drug __PUNCT__
women ar get free prevent care for thing like cervic cancer __PUNCT__
if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ we go to help you get it __PUNCT__
and if you can afford health insur and you don't bui it __PUNCT__ we not go to let you pass those cost on to other peopl __PUNCT__
so the afford care act wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
health care wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
that a differ in thi elect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me talk about on more big contrast in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that is __PUNCT__ how do we deal with our deficit and our debt __PUNCT__
the other side sai thi is our most import problem __PUNCT__ we got to look out for futur gener __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ let look at what thei actual propos __PUNCT__
thei propos __PUNCT__ on top of continu all the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ even for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ to also then have anoth __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of which would go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ thi is on their web site __PUNCT__
their propos is in congress right now __PUNCT__
and the onli wai to pai for thi would be to gut our invest in transport __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ basic research in thing like alzheim and cancer __PUNCT__ voucher the medicar system __PUNCT__
and thei will not ask for a singl dime of addit revenu from those who can afford to pai it __PUNCT__
i think that __PUNCT__ that not a recip for econom growth __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ middl class famili __PUNCT__ folk who ar make __MONEY__ or less __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ you shouldn't see your tax go up on dime __PUNCT__
you don't need to __PUNCT__
your incom tax should stai constant __PUNCT__
and i said to congress let go ahead and get that done now __PUNCT__
let give __NUM__ percent of folk certainti right now __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of small busi earn less than __MONEY__ so the vast major of peopl would get immedi relief __PUNCT__
let cut program that don't work __PUNCT__
i alreadi made a trillion dollar worth of cut __PUNCT__
not everi govern program work __PUNCT__
govern can't alwai solv everi problem __PUNCT__
govern can't help folk who don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
our educ system won't improv just becaus of more monei __PUNCT__
it also involv parent instil a love of learn in their children __PUNCT__
but there no reason why we can't make the invest __PUNCT__ we probabl had somebodi who faint __PUNCT__
that happen sometim when __PUNCT__ you gui got to stai hydrat __PUNCT__
we get a paramed in there __PUNCT__
thei be all right __PUNCT__
just give them space __PUNCT__
thei be okai __PUNCT__
thei be okai __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ thei be fine __PUNCT__
so the thing that we got to make sure of __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ is that we continu to make the invest we need to grow the economi __PUNCT__ and we can bring down our deficit __PUNCT__ get control of our debt by ask folk like me to do a littl bit more __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just sai thi __PUNCT__
just like we tri their plan __PUNCT__ we tri what i talk about too __PUNCT__
a gui name bill clinton did it __PUNCT__
and we end up have record surplus __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and the folk at the top did realli well also __PUNCT__ becaus when the middl class and work peopl ar do well __PUNCT__ everybodi doe well __PUNCT__
small busi do well __PUNCT__
big busi do well __PUNCT__
millionair do well __PUNCT__
billionair do well __PUNCT__
everybodi doe well when the economi is grow in a wai where everybodi prosper __PUNCT__
and so we got thi fundament choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ and the question is __PUNCT__ how bad ar we go to work for our vision __PUNCT__ becaus thi is go to be a close elect __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__
i want everybodi to understand thi __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ it wa close the last time __PUNCT__ it will be even closer thi time __PUNCT__
it will be even closer thi time __PUNCT__
and we ar see more monei spent on neg ad than ever befor __PUNCT__ folk just write __MONEY__ million check becaus of thi citizen unit opinion __PUNCT__ undisclos donat __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and so you ar go to be inund everi singl dai __PUNCT__
you alreadi see it __PUNCT__
and thei all go to have a scari voic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and the ad __PUNCT__ thei got a veri simpl messag __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it need to be __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
that their onli messag __PUNCT__
thei have variat on the theme __PUNCT__ but it the same theme __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i might be worri about that if it wasn't for the fact that you taught me someth in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
what you taught me wa that the american peopl __PUNCT__ when thei get togeth __PUNCT__ when thei ar determin __PUNCT__ when thei cut through all the nonsens and thei sai __PUNCT__ thi is what matter __PUNCT__ thi is what right __PUNCT__ thi is what true __PUNCT__ when you tap into those stori of our parent and our grandpar and our great grandpar __PUNCT__ folk who mai have come here as immigr __PUNCT__ mayb were brought here on slave ship __PUNCT__ folk who came here __PUNCT__ but understood that there wa someth about thi countri where we don't have to settl for what is todai __PUNCT__ we can dream of what might be __PUNCT__ we go to fight __PUNCT__
we go to struggl __PUNCT__
we go to push togeth to build the kind of perfect union that the founder talk about __PUNCT__
when you decid we go to move forward __PUNCT__ we move forward __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ if you believ __PUNCT__ as i do __PUNCT__ in an economi where everybodi get a fair shot and everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi ha the same set __PUNCT__ plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ if you believ __PUNCT__ as i believ __PUNCT__ that we in thi togeth __PUNCT__ that for all our individu initi and all our self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__ there ar some thing we do best togeth __PUNCT__ that that how we educ a gener on the gi bill __PUNCT__ that how we built the hoover dam and the golden gate bridg __PUNCT__ that how we sent a man to the moon __PUNCT__ that how we invent the internet __PUNCT__ if you believ that we rise or fall togeth as on peopl __PUNCT__ then i confid we go to win __PUNCT__
i confid we will be success __PUNCT__
and i want to remind you __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ i tri to keep my promis to on that i could keep __PUNCT__
i said i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__

but my most import promis wa tell you that i wasn't a perfect man __PUNCT__ michel could have told you that __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that i wasn't a perfect presid __PUNCT__ but that i alwai tell you where i stood __PUNCT__ i alwai tell you what i thought __PUNCT__ and i would spend everi singl wake moment as presid fight as hard as i knew how for you __PUNCT__
