we repeal __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__ becaus anybodi who is will to sacrific and serv thi countri we love shouldn't be prevent becaus of who thei love __PUNCT__
when governor romnei said we should let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thank __PUNCT__ we not go to take that busi advic __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ we reinvent a dy auto industri that come roar back to the top of the world __PUNCT__
and you mai have heard __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ in the debat governor romnei try to claim that i did what he advis __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__

did you hear that __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
unbeliev __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
everybodi in the auto industri know that not what he said __PUNCT__

we got more work to do __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
so i __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we have more work to do though __PUNCT__
i will not be satisfi until everybodi who want to work hard can find a job __PUNCT__
and that mean we got to have a plan to grow not just the economi and creat job __PUNCT__ but creat good job and provid secur for the middl class __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ i want to send fewer job oversea __PUNCT__ sell more product oversea __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ governor romnei ha no problem give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea or outsourc __PUNCT__
but i want to reward compani that ar invest right here __PUNCT__ invest in new hampshir __PUNCT__ invest in manchest __PUNCT__ insourc __PUNCT__ open new plant __PUNCT__ hire new worker __PUNCT__ creat new job right here in america __PUNCT__
that what we need to do __PUNCT__
i want to control more of our own energi and how we us energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of do noth __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so by the middl of the next decad your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
we doubl the amount of renew energi we gener from sourc like wind and solar __PUNCT__ even as we increas the product of oil and natur ga __PUNCT__
so todai __PUNCT__ america is less depend on foreign oil than ani time in the last two decad __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
our oil import ar go down __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ governor romnei want to revers some of these choic __PUNCT__
he want to gut some of our invest in educ to pai __PUNCT__ help pai for thi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
i think we should make sure that we ar do more in educ __PUNCT__ hire new math and scienc teacher so that thei can get the lead in the technolog that go to shape our economi in the futur __PUNCT__

that what we fight for __PUNCT__
