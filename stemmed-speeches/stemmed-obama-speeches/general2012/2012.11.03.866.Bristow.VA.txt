we believ that there a role for rule and regul that ar smart __PUNCT__ and then we also believ there ar some thing we should leav to the peopl __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ we don't think politician in washington ar veri smart about control health care choic that women ar perfectli capabl of make themselv __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ we had a presid who share these belief __PUNCT__
you just heard him __PUNCT__
presid clinton econom plan ask the wealthiest american to pai a littl bit more so we could reduc our deficit and invest in the skill and idea of our peopl __PUNCT__

incom were up __PUNCT__
poverti wa down __PUNCT__
our deficit becam the biggest surplu in histori __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ we know our idea work __PUNCT__
what about their idea __PUNCT__ we tri those too __PUNCT__
after bill clinton left offic __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ year we tri give big tax cut to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__

and what did we get __PUNCT__ fall incom __PUNCT__ record deficit __PUNCT__ the slowest job growth in half a centuri __PUNCT__ and an econom crisi that we been clean up after ever sinc __PUNCT__
so we tri on wai __PUNCT__ it work __PUNCT__
we tri anoth wai __PUNCT__ it didn't work __PUNCT__ which present a dilemma for governor romnei __PUNCT__ sinc he want to go back to the same polici that didn't work __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ governor romnei is a veri talent salesman __PUNCT__
so in thi campaign __PUNCT__ he ha tri as hard as he can to repackag these same idea __PUNCT__ and he got __PUNCT__ i think presid clinton call it __PUNCT__ the brass __PUNCT__ to call it chang __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ we know what chang look like __PUNCT__
we know what chang look like __PUNCT__ and what governor romnei sell ain't it __PUNCT__
give more power to the biggest bank isn't chang __PUNCT__
anoth __MONEY__ trillion tax cut for the wealthi __PUNCT__ that not chang __PUNCT__
refus to answer question about the detail of your polici until after the elect __PUNCT__ that definit not chang __PUNCT__

so when you try to sort through thi argument about chang __PUNCT__ part of what you have to ask yourself is __PUNCT__ who do you trust __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
when you talk about the economi and polici that so critic to our futur __PUNCT__ you got to ask yourself __PUNCT__ who do you trust __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
you __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ govern alon can't do that __PUNCT__
parent __PUNCT__ you got to parent __PUNCT__ student __PUNCT__ you got to studi __PUNCT__
but don't tell me that hire more teacher won't help our economi grow __PUNCT__
don't tell me that student who can't afford colleg should just borrow monei from their parent __PUNCT__
that wasn't an option for me __PUNCT__ it wasn't an option for bill clinton __PUNCT__
i bet it not an option for a lot of you __PUNCT__
that why i want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that why i want to recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher so we don't fall behind the rest of the world __PUNCT__
that why i want to train __NUM__ million american at our commun colleg to get the skill busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
that real chang __PUNCT__
that what we fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__
that what at stake __PUNCT__
i want us to live up to thi countri legaci of innov __PUNCT__
i proud i bet on american worker and the american auto industri __PUNCT__
but i even prouder we not just build car again __PUNCT__ we build better car __PUNCT__ car that by the middl of the next decad will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that kind of innov __PUNCT__ that kind of forward think __PUNCT__ we don't have to restrict it just to the auto industri __PUNCT__
i want to bring manufactur back on all kind of thing __PUNCT__
we got thousand of worker build long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__ build wind turbin all across the countri __PUNCT__
so instead of subsid oil compani __PUNCT__ profit when thei make monei hand over fist __PUNCT__ i want to support energi job of tomorrow __PUNCT__ which will cut our oil import in half __PUNCT__ which will help our environ __PUNCT__ help our nation secur __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax code that reward compani for creat those job oversea __PUNCT__ i want to reward compani that ar creat those job in virginia __PUNCT__
that the futur i see for thi countri __PUNCT__
chang is turn the page on a decad of war so we can focu on nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we pursu our enemi with the strongest militari the world ever known __PUNCT__
and virginia carri more than it load when it come to defend thi countri __PUNCT__ and we ar grate to thi state __PUNCT__
but we also understand __PUNCT__ to be strong it time to us some of the save from wind down two war to pai down our debt and rebuild america __PUNCT__ fix road __PUNCT__ put folk back to work rebuild our bridg __PUNCT__ make sure our school ar state of the art __PUNCT__
and that especi import for our veteran __PUNCT__
we want to put them to work __PUNCT__ becaus if thei have fought for our countri and defend our freedom __PUNCT__ thei shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
that my commit to them __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
and presid clinton talk about it __PUNCT__ we got to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
that real chang __PUNCT__
but we got to do it in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
i cut a trillion dollar __PUNCT__ worth of spend __PUNCT__
we can do more __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about deficit reduct __PUNCT__ if we not just us it in tv ad and then onc you get into offic __PUNCT__ like dick chenei __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ doesn't matter __PUNCT__ then we also have to ask the wealthiest american to go back to the tax rate that thei paid when presid clinton wa in offic __PUNCT__
and the reason is becaus budget ar about choic __PUNCT__ about prioriti __PUNCT__
what ar we go to invest in __PUNCT__ as long as i presid __PUNCT__ i not go to turn medicar into a voucher just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ we know what chang is __PUNCT__
we know what the futur requir __PUNCT__
we know also that it won't be easi __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ i talk about thi __PUNCT__
i warn some of you __PUNCT__ mayb you weren't believ me __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ chang __PUNCT__ real chang __PUNCT__ isn't just about chang presid or chang parti __PUNCT__ it about chang our polit __PUNCT__
i ran becaus the voic of the american peopl __PUNCT__ your voic __PUNCT__ had been shut out of our democraci for too long by lobbyist and special interest and politician who were will to sai anyth and do anyth just to keep thing the wai thei ar __PUNCT__ the protector __PUNCT__ the guardian of the statu quo __PUNCT__
and that statu quo in washington ha fought us everi step of the wai over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
thei spent million of dollar try to prevent us from reform health care __PUNCT__ million of dollar try to prevent us from reform wall street __PUNCT__
thei engin a strategi of gridlock in congress __PUNCT__ refus to compromis on idea that in the past both democrat and republican had support __PUNCT__
and what thei count on now is that you go to be so worn down by all the squabbl __PUNCT__ so tire of the dysfunct __PUNCT__ so weari of what goe on __PUNCT__ on capitol hill __PUNCT__ that you just go to give up and walk awai __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and just put them back in power or let them stai there __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ their bet is on cynic __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ my bet on you __PUNCT__
my bet on you and the decenc and the good sens of the american peopl __PUNCT__
and it not a partisan bet i make __PUNCT__
when the other parti ha been will to work with me to help the middl class __PUNCT__ i right there with them __PUNCT__
i happi about it __PUNCT__
i would have less grai hair if thei readi to go __PUNCT__

we celebr them __PUNCT__
we embrac them __PUNCT__
i work with anybodi of ani parti to move thi countri forward __PUNCT__

but we still go to have some fight becaus there ar some valu that ar at stake __PUNCT__
there ar some principl we got to fight for __PUNCT__
if the price of peac in washington is cut deal that will kick student off financi aid or get rid of fund for plan parenthood or let insur compani discrimin against peopl with preexist condit or elimin health care for million on medicaid who ar poor or elderli or disabl or kick kid off of head start __PUNCT__ i not bui that __PUNCT__
that not a price i will to pai __PUNCT__
that not bipartisanship __PUNCT__
