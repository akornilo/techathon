and thi will be __PUNCT__ on wai or anoth __PUNCT__ thi will be my last campaign __PUNCT__ which get me to think about my first campaign __PUNCT__
and i wa a lawyer __PUNCT__ and i wa teach law __PUNCT__ and thi seat __PUNCT__ the state senat seat came up __PUNCT__
and i told michel __PUNCT__ some peopl had talk to me about run for offic __PUNCT__ what did she think __PUNCT__
and she said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that a dumb idea __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but after i explain to her why i thought it might make sens for me to run __PUNCT__ she join in __PUNCT__
and we didn't have a budget __PUNCT__ we didn't have tv ad __PUNCT__
we print a bunch of stuff at kinko __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and we had a few friend who volunt __PUNCT__
and we start knock on door __PUNCT__ and i go in front of the groceri store __PUNCT__ and i shake hand __PUNCT__
and we would march in parad __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the fourth of __DATE__ parad in hyde park __PUNCT__ back in chicago __PUNCT__ thei had a tradit where thei made folk who were in offic or run for offic dress up __PUNCT__
and somebodi had an outfit for me __PUNCT__
it wa sort of like a minuteman outfit with __PUNCT__ like __PUNCT__ a hat and sort of the cutoff pant __PUNCT__
and my leg ar kind of skinni __PUNCT__ so i didn't look veri good in them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ at thi point __PUNCT__ an audienc member whistl __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and then i won that race __PUNCT__ and so i serv in the state senat __PUNCT__
and then i got the idea of run for the unit state senat after serv __NUM__ year in the state senat __PUNCT__
and i decid to go to michel and ask her what she thought __PUNCT__
and she said __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that a dumb idea __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but becaus i had had a chanc as a state senat to travel the whole state of illinoi __PUNCT__ which is a lot like ohio __PUNCT__ it a mix of big citi and rural commun and folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ and i start just travel the state __PUNCT__
and i go to state fair __PUNCT__ and i __PUNCT__ we go to counti fair __PUNCT__ and we stop in littl town and meet folk and go to vfw hall __PUNCT__
and what i realiz dure that senat race __PUNCT__ and what i realiz when i first ran for the state senat __PUNCT__ wa the reason i got into polit wa becaus __PUNCT__ in thi countri __PUNCT__ there is thi core american idea that we celebr yesterdai __PUNCT__
and that is if you work hard __PUNCT__ if you take respons for yourself and your famili __PUNCT__ and you don't get discourag when you hit some setback __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
the basic american bargain that sai __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter what you look like __PUNCT__ where you come from __PUNCT__ where you worship __PUNCT__ the idea is that you don't have to be born into fame or fortun __PUNCT__
if you will to appli yourself and work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
you can follow your dream __PUNCT__
and the reason i got into that first race wai back when and the reason i ran for the senat and __PUNCT__ ultim __PUNCT__ the reason i ran for presid wa becaus that had been avail for my famili __PUNCT__
my grandpar particip in world war ii __PUNCT__
my grandfath fought in patton armi __PUNCT__ and my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
but when my grandfath came back __PUNCT__ he wa abl to studi on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and thei were abl to bui their first home with some help from the fha __PUNCT__
america gave them that opportun __PUNCT__ didn't give them a handout __PUNCT__ but gave them that chanc __PUNCT__
and when my mom __PUNCT__ a singl mom __PUNCT__ wa rais two kid and try to get her educ __PUNCT__ there were grant and loan avail __PUNCT__ and she could instil a love of learn in me and my sister __PUNCT__ and we had a chanc to get a great educ __PUNCT__
and you look at michel famili __PUNCT__ her dad wa what wa call a stationari engin at the water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__ a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__
even though he had ms __PUNCT__ he have to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els to get dress and get to the job __PUNCT__ but he never miss a dai of work __PUNCT__
and michel mom __PUNCT__ she stai at home rais the kid and then later becam a secretari __PUNCT__
thei never had a lot __PUNCT__ but thei had a chanc to give their kid thi great educ __PUNCT__
and so my whole life __PUNCT__ and michel whole life __PUNCT__ wa an exampl of thi american dream __PUNCT__ thi idea that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can find a job that pai a live wage and you can afford a home __PUNCT__ you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__ you can retir with some digniti and respect __PUNCT__ you can take a vacat __PUNCT__
it mai not be fanci __PUNCT__ you might not be go to some fanci resort __PUNCT__ but you can go with your kid and enjoi each other compani and see the amaz sight of thi countri __PUNCT__
and the problem wa that you could feel __PUNCT__ over the last decad __PUNCT__ how that dream wa slip awai for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
thei were work harder and harder __PUNCT__ but it seem like wage weren't go up __PUNCT__ incom weren't go up __PUNCT__ opportun weren't increas __PUNCT__ the cost of health care wa go up __PUNCT__ the cost of colleg wa go up __PUNCT__ ga price go up __PUNCT__ groceri go up __PUNCT__
so that basic bargain felt like it wa slip awai from too mani peopl __PUNCT__
that what got me into polit __PUNCT__ that why i ran for the state senat __PUNCT__ that why i enter my first polit race __PUNCT__ that why i run my last polit race __PUNCT__ becaus i want to make sure that the next gener __PUNCT__ not just my kid __PUNCT__ but everybodi __PUNCT__ ha that same chanc __PUNCT__ that we get that bargain back for america middl class __PUNCT__
that what sherrod is fight for and marci is fight for and betti is fight for and i am fight for __PUNCT__
that what you believ in __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi __PUNCT__ these past 3Â½ year have made it tough on everybodi __PUNCT__
we saw the middl class struggl and folk who were try to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
i want to sai __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ when i talk about middl class __PUNCT__ i also talk about poor folk who ar do the right thing and try to get into the middl class __PUNCT__
and middl class is also an attitud __PUNCT__
it not just about incom __PUNCT__
it about know what import and not measur your success just base on your bank account __PUNCT__
but it about your valu and be respons and look after each other and give back __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
give back __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
give back __PUNCT__
and it wa tough even befor the crisi hit __PUNCT__
and then thi crisi hit __PUNCT__ and the auto industri almost went under __PUNCT__ and peopl lost their job __PUNCT__ and peopl lost their home __PUNCT__
and we been work 24/7 __PUNCT__ __NUM__ dai a year __PUNCT__ for the last 3Â½ year to try to right the ship and recov __PUNCT__
and we seen progress __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
it work __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
we seen progress __PUNCT__
when some were sai __PUNCT__ let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ i said let bet on the american worker __PUNCT__
and now that chrysler plant is churn out some of the best car in the world __PUNCT__
and gm is back on top __PUNCT__
and ford is on the move __PUNCT__
we seen manufactur start to come back to ohio __PUNCT__
we seen the unemploy rate drop __PUNCT__
so we made progress __PUNCT__
but we all know we got so much more work to do __PUNCT__
there ar too mani folk still out of work __PUNCT__ home still underwat __PUNCT__
too mani kid ar still try to figur out how to pai for their colleg educ __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ these challeng had been build up over decad __PUNCT__ and we knew we weren't go to turn it around overnight __PUNCT__
what we want to do wa make sure that we start move in the right direct __PUNCT__ move forward __PUNCT__ not move backward __PUNCT__
and we been abl to do that __PUNCT__
we been move forward __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ we been move forward without a lot of help from the other side __PUNCT__
we been kind of yank them __PUNCT__
thei been on our ankl and pull us back __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but we been move forward __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ there is so much more we could be do __PUNCT__
and the reason i so glad you here todai is becaus the onli wai we ar go to keep move forward is with you __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know you probabl ar alreadi sick of thi elect with all the commerci and all the nasti that out there and the foolish and the misinform and all the polit report about poll and who up and who down __PUNCT__
but look __PUNCT__ i want you to understand __PUNCT__ noth could be bigger right now than the choic you about to make __PUNCT__ the choic you about to make __PUNCT__
becaus it more than just be about two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__ thi is about two fundament differ vision of how we move forward __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ hi alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei got a particular view __PUNCT__
thei believ that if we cut tax __PUNCT__ for especi the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ about __MONEY__ trillion on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ paid for by cut educ and cut __PUNCT__ make medicar a voucher program and cut program for our kid __PUNCT__ that somehow if we do that and we elimin regul that we put in place __PUNCT__ thank to the work of these great member of congress __PUNCT__ so that we don't have taxpay bailout of wall street bank anymor __PUNCT__ that if we roll those back __PUNCT__ that somehow all thi is go to benefit you __PUNCT__
that first __PUNCT__ it will benefit wealthi investor __PUNCT__ and then thing will rain down on you and benefit you in some fashion __PUNCT__
that the theori __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just sai __PUNCT__ thi is a coher theori __PUNCT__
you can see it on their web site __PUNCT__
thei don't make a secret about what thei plan to do __PUNCT__
the onli problem is we tri it __PUNCT__
we tri it for about __NUM__ year right befor i wa elect as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
it didn't make the middl class stronger __PUNCT__
job growth wa sluggish __PUNCT__
your wage and your incom did not go up __PUNCT__
it didn't grow our economi the wai it need to __PUNCT__
and it culmin in the worst financi crisi we had sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
so their theori wa tri __PUNCT__ but it a theori __PUNCT__
i got a differ theori __PUNCT__
i think thei wrong __PUNCT__
as wendi said __PUNCT__ i don't think we grow our economi from the top down __PUNCT__
i think we grow the economi from the middl class out __PUNCT__
i think __PUNCT__ we grow the economi by make sure everybodi ha got a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
and so when i look at how do we move forward __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__ we make progress in manufactur __PUNCT__
let make more progress __PUNCT__
let stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give them to compani that ar invest right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
when i think about move forward __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__ let invest in advanc manufactur in thi __NUM__ __PUNCT__ centuri economi for us to make sure that we at the forefront of advanc batteri manufactur so the next gener of car ar built here in america __PUNCT__ invest in clean energi to make sure that solar panel and wind turbin ar built here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
those ar smart invest __PUNCT__
that how we move forward __PUNCT__
when i think about move forward __PUNCT__ i think about how do we make sure that american young peopl ar the best educ in the world __PUNCT__
so i want to hire new teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__ and i want to train them better and pai them better __PUNCT__
and i want to give __NUM__ million more peopl the opportun to go to a commun colleg and train for the job that exist right now __PUNCT__
and i want to make colleg more afford for young peopl and bring tuition down __PUNCT__
that how we move forward __PUNCT__
that my vision for the futur __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ i believ that we should have a health care system that work for middl class famili __PUNCT__
and i am __PUNCT__ couldn't be prouder of the work that we have done in get thi health care law pass __PUNCT__
and there is so much misinform out there __PUNCT__ so i just want to clear up a coupl of thing __PUNCT__
if you got health insur right now __PUNCT__ here what thi bill mean __PUNCT__ it mean that insur compani can't drop you for no reason or when you need it most __PUNCT__ it mean that your kid can stai on your health insur plan until thei __NUM__ and have realli gotten a job that provid them benefit __PUNCT__ it mean that thei can't impos lifetim limit __PUNCT__ insur compani can't impos lifetim limit so that when you realli need it __PUNCT__ suddenli thei sai __PUNCT__ we don't have ani more insur for you __PUNCT__
it a patient bill of right for you if you have insur __PUNCT__ and if you don't have health insur __PUNCT__ then it give you a chanc to bui into a pool so that you get the same deal as folk who ar work at big compani do __PUNCT__
and if you a senior on medicar __PUNCT__ it mean your prescript drug cost ar go to be lower and we go to close that donut hole that ha hurt a lot of senior __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i think that wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
that part of move forward __PUNCT__
we need to have an american energi polici __PUNCT__
we produc more oil and ga than we have in a long time __PUNCT__ and we import less oil from oversea than we have in the past __PUNCT__
but we can keep on do more __PUNCT__ not onli increas product of tradit fuel __PUNCT__ but in develop and invent new fuel becaus we need to free ourselv from our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ we can put peopl back to work in the process __PUNCT__
that move forward __PUNCT__
i want to rebuild america __PUNCT__
i promis __PUNCT__ i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
we transit out of afghanistan __PUNCT__
we taken on al qaida __PUNCT__ and we kill bin laden __PUNCT__
and now i want to take half the monei that we no longer spend on war and us it to drive down our deficit __PUNCT__
and i want to take the other half to start do some nation __PUNCT__ build here in ohio __PUNCT__
do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ rebuild our road and our bridg and our school __PUNCT__ lai broadband line and high __PUNCT__ speed rail __PUNCT__
that how we build america __PUNCT__
that my idea of move forward __PUNCT__
so i got a differ vision __PUNCT__ and nowher is that vision __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ bigger than when it come to how do we deal with our debt and our deficit __PUNCT__
biggest contributor to our debt and our deficit __PUNCT__ in addit to thi recess __PUNCT__ were two tax cut that weren't paid for and two war run on a credit card __PUNCT__
and mr __PUNCT__ romnei propos to deal with thi is anoth __MONEY__ trillion of tax cut that aren't paid for __PUNCT__ or if thei paid for __PUNCT__ on the back of you __PUNCT__
that not a plan to deal with our deficit __PUNCT__
so what i said is __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ we go to get rid of program that don't work __PUNCT__
we don't want to wast monei __PUNCT__
we can't afford it __PUNCT__ we don't have enough __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ i not somebodi who believ that everi govern program work __PUNCT__
i don't think govern can solv everi problem __PUNCT__
i don't think we can alwai help folk who don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i don't care how much monei we spend on school if parent aren't parent __PUNCT__
so govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ but there ar some thing we have to do to grow the economi __PUNCT__
so we got to invest in educ __PUNCT__
we got to invest in basic scienc and research __PUNCT__
we got to invest in infrastructur __PUNCT__
we got to make sure that medicar and social secur ar there for our senior __PUNCT__
so in addit to wise spend cut __PUNCT__ there noth wrong with ask the wealthi to pai a littl more in tax __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just sai thi __PUNCT__ i don't need a tax cut __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
romnei sure doesn't need a tax cut __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ i don't want a tax cut if it mean __PUNCT__ suddenli __PUNCT__ student ar have a tougher time afford go to colleg __PUNCT__
i don't want a tax cut if it mean senior have to pai someth more for medicar __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ a lot of success peopl agre with that __PUNCT__
and the reason thei do is becaus thei rememb what it wa like when thei weren't success and somebodi gave them a help hand __PUNCT__
and so i think a lot of peopl want to do the right thing __PUNCT__
but we can't have a cultur that just encourag selfish and look out for yourself and not look out for anybodi els __PUNCT__ just look out for you and not the next gener __PUNCT__
so there ar two fundament differ vision about how we move the countri forward __PUNCT__
and the great thing about our democraci is you get to be the tiebreak __PUNCT__
it up to you __PUNCT__
it up to you to decid what vision make more sens __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei vision __PUNCT__ the vision of hi republican alli and some of the special interest in washington __PUNCT__ we tri that vision __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
my vision __PUNCT__ the last time we tri it wa when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
and we creat __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__ we had a budget surplu __PUNCT__ and we creat a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
everybodi did well __PUNCT__ becaus we in it togeth __PUNCT__
and ultim __PUNCT__ that what it come down to __PUNCT__ do you believ that we on our own __PUNCT__ all of us __PUNCT__ or do you believ we in it togeth __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ when i think about what made america great __PUNCT__ it been our rug individu and our willing to take risk and peopl go out there and start a small busi that becom a medium __PUNCT__ size busi __PUNCT__ becom a big busi __PUNCT__ thei start hire __PUNCT__
all those thing have contribut __PUNCT__
but what ha also made us great is there ar some thing we understood we do togeth __PUNCT__
we build the hoover dam and the golden gate bridg __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we take care of our veteran __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we send them to school on the gi bill __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we invest in basic research that creat the internet __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we send a man to the moon __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we build the interst highwai system __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we do these thing not becaus it help ani on of us individu __PUNCT__ but becaus it give opportun for all of us to succe __PUNCT__
that what at stake in thi elect __PUNCT__
and you ar the tiebreak __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you will see a lot of stuff on tv __PUNCT__
the other side is spend more monei than we ever seen befor __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ you got billionair just write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__
thei just __PUNCT__ thei spend monei like nobodi busi __PUNCT__
and all of them have the same messag __PUNCT__ all these ad __PUNCT__ which basic is __PUNCT__ the economi is bad __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ thei got variat on thi theme __PUNCT__ but it the same theme everi time __PUNCT__
sometim thei sai __PUNCT__ it obama fault becaus he think govern is all the answer __PUNCT__
sometim it becaus __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ he doesn't have privat sector experi make a lot of monei like the other gui __PUNCT__
some of it is __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ he just think everyth is fine or he is in over hi head __PUNCT__
but it all the same theme __PUNCT__
and i think a lot of peopl ar look at thi __PUNCT__
thei sai __PUNCT__ we don't know how thi is go to turn out becaus we never seen a sit presid outspent like thi __PUNCT__ with all thi monei and all these neg attack __PUNCT__
and mayb it work __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but it a plan to run a campaign __PUNCT__
it not a plan to put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
their plan is not a plan to grow the middl class __PUNCT__
and when i think back to my first campaign __PUNCT__ and i think back to that first senat campaign that i ran __PUNCT__ what i alwai rememb __PUNCT__ what michel and i learn __PUNCT__ wa folk can spend a whole lot of monei and thei can run a whole bunch of neg attack __PUNCT__
but when the american peopl decid what right __PUNCT__ when ordinari peopl ar remind of what best in us __PUNCT__ when we rememb what our valu ar and we will to fight for them __PUNCT__ when we will to sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ thi is not just about me __PUNCT__ but thi is about my kid and my grandkid __PUNCT__ and so i go to work as hard as i can and i go to talk to my friend and i go to talk to my neighbor __PUNCT__ i go to talk to my cowork and i know it go to be frustrat and i know it go to be hard sometim and there ar go to be setback __PUNCT__ but i go to stai with it __PUNCT__ and enough peopl start have that feel __PUNCT__ noth can stop them __PUNCT__
noth can stop you __PUNCT__
i don't care how much the other side spend __PUNCT__
you cannot be stop onc you have decid what is right and what is true __PUNCT__
in the last elect __PUNCT__ i told peopl __PUNCT__ i not a perfect man and i certainli wasn't go to be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but i said __PUNCT__ i alwai tell you what i thought and i alwai tell you where i stood and i spend everi singl dai fight as hard as i knew how for you to try to make sure that everi singl on of you had the same chanc as my famili had becaus i saw myself in you __PUNCT__
i saw my hope and dream in you __PUNCT__
and when i see your kid __PUNCT__ i see my kid __PUNCT__
and when i see your grandpar __PUNCT__ i see my grandpar __PUNCT__
and i have kept that promis __PUNCT__
and as long as i have the privileg of be your presid __PUNCT__ i will keep that promis becaus i still believ in you __PUNCT__
and if you still believ in me __PUNCT__ and if you will to stand with me and knock on some door with me and make some phone call with me __PUNCT__ we will finish what we start in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and we will grow thi middl class __PUNCT__ and we will strengthen america __PUNCT__ and we remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__
