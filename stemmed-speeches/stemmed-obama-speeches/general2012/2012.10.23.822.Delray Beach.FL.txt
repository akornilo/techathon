becaus the greatest respons i have as presid is to keep the american peopl safe __PUNCT__
that why i end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ so we could go after the terrorist who actual attack us on 9/11 __PUNCT__
that why we decim al qaida core leadership and brought usama bin laden the justic he deserv __PUNCT__
that why we end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ it time to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
in a world of new threat and profound challeng __PUNCT__ america need leadership that is strong and is steadi __PUNCT__
governor romnei foreign polici ha been wrong and reckless __PUNCT__
last night he wa all over the map __PUNCT__
did you notic that __PUNCT__ dure the debat __PUNCT__ he said he didn't want more troop in iraq __PUNCT__ but he wa caught on video sai it wa unthink not to leav __NUM__ troop in iraq __PUNCT__ troop that would still be there todai __PUNCT__
last night he claim to support my plan to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i glad he support it __PUNCT__
but he oppos a timelin that would actual bring our troop home __PUNCT__
earli in thi campaign he said he do the opposit of whatev i did in israel __PUNCT__ but last night i remind him that cooper with israel ha never been stronger __PUNCT__
last night he said he alwai support take out usama bin laden __PUNCT__ but in __NUM__ he said it wasn't worth move heaven and earth to catch on man __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we come up with a name for thi condit __PUNCT__
it call romnesia __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
romnesia __PUNCT__ romnesia __PUNCT__ romnesia __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we had a sever outbreak last night __PUNCT__
it wa at least stage __PUNCT__ three romnesia __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i just want to go over with you some of the symptom __PUNCT__ delrai __PUNCT__ becaus i want to make sure nobodi in the surround area catch it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ if you sai that you love american car dure a debat __PUNCT__ but you wrote an articl titl __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ you might have romnesia __PUNCT__
if you talk about how much you love teacher dure a debat __PUNCT__ but said just a few week ago that we shouldn't hire ani more becaus thei won't grow the economi __PUNCT__ what do you have __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
romnesia __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i bet you got some romnesia __PUNCT__
if you sai you love medicar __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ there a theme here __PUNCT__ he keep on love stuff and then want to end it or cut it or not help it __PUNCT__
but if you sai that you love medicar __PUNCT__ but your plan turn it into a voucher that end the guarante benefit of medicar __PUNCT__ you definit have romnesia __PUNCT__
so i mean __PUNCT__ we break down the symptom here __PUNCT__
if you come down with a case of romnesia __PUNCT__ if you can't seem to rememb the polici on your web site or the promis that you been make over the __NUM__ year that you been run for presid __PUNCT__ if you can't even rememb what you said last week __PUNCT__ don't worri __PUNCT__ obamacar cover preexist condit __PUNCT__
we can fix you up __PUNCT__
we can cure thi diseas __PUNCT__
there a cure __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ let me just sai thi __PUNCT__
in all serious __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we accustom to see politician chang their posit from __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
we ar not accustom to see politician chang their posit from __NUM__ dai ago __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ and we joke about romnesia __PUNCT__ but you know what __PUNCT__ thi is actual someth import __PUNCT__ thi is about trust __PUNCT__
there no more seriou issu in a presidenti campaign than trust __PUNCT__
the person who lead thi countri __PUNCT__ you got to have some confid that he or she mean what he or she sai __PUNCT__ that if thei tell you thei go to do someth or that thi is what thei believ __PUNCT__ that thei go to actual try to do it __PUNCT__
it doesn't mean that everi candid is go to get everyth done all at onc perfectli __PUNCT__ but you want somebodi to be abl to look you in the ey and sai __PUNCT__ here what i believ __PUNCT__
here what i stand for __PUNCT__
here what i fight for __PUNCT__
here what i care about __PUNCT__
here who i go to be look out for in the debat in washington __PUNCT__
but part of the reason i think thi is hard for governor romnei to do is hi job plan doesn't realli creat job __PUNCT__
hi deficit plan doesn't reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ it add to it __PUNCT__
hi foreign polici is from the 1980 __PUNCT__
hi social polici is from the 1950 __PUNCT__
hi econom polici ar from the 1920 __PUNCT__
so everyth he do right now is to hide hi real posit and try to win thi elect __PUNCT__
he want to just spend all hi time and focu on tell peopl what he think is wrong with america __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ if you notic __PUNCT__ in hi debat __PUNCT__ in hi speech __PUNCT__ he is realli excel at list all the thing that ar wrong __PUNCT__
he can just go over it verbatim __PUNCT__ just boom __PUNCT__ boom __PUNCT__ boom __PUNCT__ powerpoint present __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ that not leadership that you can trust __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ you know me __PUNCT__
