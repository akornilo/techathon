we could not be prouder of our u. __PUNCT__ athlet __PUNCT__ bring home the gold __PUNCT__ conduct themselv as we would hope that somebodi would conduct themselv repres the unit state __PUNCT__
thei just did an outstand job __PUNCT__
and i know that all of you look like pretti smart folk __PUNCT__ so you were spend most of your time watch the olymp __PUNCT__ if you were watch tv __PUNCT__
but unless your cabl is broken __PUNCT__ you probabl also know we got a pretti intens campaign go on right now __PUNCT__
and the reason that thi is such an intens campaign is becaus we could not have a bigger choic in front of us than the on that we face in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
it not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
more than ani other elect __PUNCT__ thi is a choic about two differ vision for the countri __PUNCT__ for two differ direct of where america should go __PUNCT__
and the direct that we choos __PUNCT__ the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ is go to make a differ not just in your life __PUNCT__ but in the live of your children and in the live of your grandchildren __PUNCT__
it will make a differ for decad to come __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ we came togeth __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ we had republican __PUNCT__ we had independ __PUNCT__ we came togeth becaus we felt as if the basic bargain that built thi countri wa in danger __PUNCT__
it wa a bargain that said here in america __PUNCT__ if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__
the basic idea that if you act respons __PUNCT__ if you ar put in all your effort __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you can find a home you can call your own __PUNCT__
you can send your kid to colleg __PUNCT__
you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
you can retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and most importantli __PUNCT__ the next gener can dream even bigger and do even better than we ever imagin __PUNCT__
that the core of the american dream __PUNCT__
that the basic american promis that made us the envi of the world __PUNCT__ that made us the most power economi in the world __PUNCT__ that built the largest middl class in the world __PUNCT__ that idea that here in america __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we had gone through a decad in which that basic compact seem as if it wasn't true for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
folk at the top were do veri well __PUNCT__ but for ordinari famili all across america __PUNCT__ it felt as if peopl were work harder __PUNCT__ make less while the cost of everyth from health care to colleg were go up __PUNCT__
job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__
we ran two war on a credit card __PUNCT__
we turn surplus into deficit __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we spent the last 3Â½ year try to get us back on track __PUNCT__
we save an auto industri on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__
we work with the financi sector to start do thing the old __PUNCT__ fashion wai __PUNCT__ lend to busi and famili __PUNCT__ instead of engag in reckless specul __PUNCT__
four and a half million new job have been creat __PUNCT__ half a million manufactur job __PUNCT__ the most sinc the 1990 __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ chicago __PUNCT__ we got a long wai to go __PUNCT__
all of us know friend __PUNCT__ neighbor __PUNCT__ famili member who ar still out of work or whose home ar still underwat __PUNCT__
too mani folk ar still burden by enorm colleg debt __PUNCT__
too mani folk still don't have a sens that tomorrow will be better than todai __PUNCT__
and so the question in thi elect is __PUNCT__ which wai do we go __PUNCT__ do we go forward toward a new vision of an america in which prosper is share __PUNCT__ or do we go backward to the same polici that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
forward __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i believ we have to go forward __PUNCT__
i believ we got to keep work to creat an america where no matter who you ar __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ no matter who you love __PUNCT__ you can make it here if you try __PUNCT__
that what at stake in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the good new is even though there ar no quick fix to our challeng __PUNCT__ we got everyth we need to make thing work here in america __PUNCT__
we still have the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we still got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg __PUNCT__ the best univers __PUNCT__ the best scientist __PUNCT__ the best research __PUNCT__
we a young nation __PUNCT__ and we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
wit thi room __PUNCT__
chicago is an exampl of what make thi countri great __PUNCT__
right __PUNCT__ so what hold us back is not the lack of big idea or good plan __PUNCT__
what hold us back is a brand of washington polit that sai we ar not go to compromis __PUNCT__ no matter what __PUNCT__
it gridlock and stalem and dysfunct __PUNCT__
and it an idea propag by the other side that somehow we go to grow thi economi from the top down __PUNCT__ and that if peopl at the top ar do realli __PUNCT__ realli well __PUNCT__ then everybodi els is automat go to benefit __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi kind of top __PUNCT__ down econom is central to governor romnei __PUNCT__ and it is central to hi run mate __PUNCT__
just yesterdai morn __PUNCT__ my oppon chose hi run mate __PUNCT__ the ideolog leader of the republican in congress __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
paul ryan __PUNCT__
and i want to congratul __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i want to congratul congressman ryan __PUNCT__
i know him __PUNCT__
i welcom him to the race __PUNCT__
congressman ryan is a decent man __PUNCT__
he is a famili man __PUNCT__
he an articul spokesman for governor romnei vision __PUNCT__
but it a vision that i fundament disagre with __PUNCT__
my oppon and congressman ryan and their alli in congress __PUNCT__ thei all believ that if we just get rid of more regul on big corpor and we give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ it will lead to job and prosper for everybodi els __PUNCT__
that what thei propos __PUNCT__
that where thei take us if thei win __PUNCT__
and thi is not specul __PUNCT__
it on their web site __PUNCT__
it embodi in the budget that the hous republican vote for repeatedli __PUNCT__
the centerpiec of governor romnei entir econom plan is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
thi is on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
last week we found out that to pai for thi __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ not onli would we see them gut educ invest __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ gut invest in scienc and research __PUNCT__ gut invest in thing like rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__ but it turn out that governor romnei tax plan would also rais tax on middl class famili by an averag of __MONEY__ each __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
not to reduc the deficit __PUNCT__ mind you __PUNCT__
not to creat more job __PUNCT__
independ economist have look at it __PUNCT__ thei said there noth in governor romnei plan that would creat job right now __PUNCT__
thi would all be in order to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to peopl who ar make __MONEY__ million a year or more __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
let me tell you someth __PUNCT__
thei have tri thi befor __PUNCT__
thei have tri to sell us thi trickl __PUNCT__ down fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and guess what __PUNCT__ it did not work __PUNCT__
it did not work __PUNCT__
it not a plan to cut the deficit __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for folk like me __PUNCT__
we need to give tax relief to work american __PUNCT__ to middl class famili __PUNCT__ for folk who ar try to rais their kid and keep them healthi and send them to colleg and keep a roof over their head __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis the american peopl i wa go to cut tax on middl class famili __PUNCT__ and that what i did __PUNCT__
the typic middl class famili is actual pai __MONEY__ less in their tax than when i came into offic __PUNCT__
and i want to keep incom tax exactli where thei ar for everybodi who make __MONEY__ a year or more __PUNCT__ which is about __NUM__ percent of the american peopl __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ percent of small busi __PUNCT__
so if your incom is __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ your incom tax will not go up a dime __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ if you lucki enough __PUNCT__ like i am __PUNCT__ to be in the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ what we said is you can afford to do a littl bit more so that we can pai down our deficit and still help young peopl go to colleg and still make sure that we invest in basic research to cure thing like alzheim and cancer __PUNCT__
we ask you to contribut a littl bit more __PUNCT__
and look __PUNCT__ govern is still go to have to do it part __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar of spend __PUNCT__ an addit __MONEY__ trillion is slate to be made __PUNCT__
we can cut out program that don't work to make sure we can invest in the thing that do __PUNCT__
we can make govern more streamlin __PUNCT__ more effici __PUNCT__
but if we realli go to be seriou about reduc the deficit and grow the economi __PUNCT__ then for folk like me to go back and pai at the rate that exist when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and creat a whole bunch of millionair to boot __PUNCT__ that is the right plan for america __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the reason that it the right plan is becaus when a construct worker or a teacher or a receptionist __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ what do thei do __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thei mayb go out and bui that new car or bui that new applianc or go to a restaur or __PUNCT__ heaven forbid __PUNCT__ thei take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and so that mean busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ and thei hire more worker __PUNCT__
histor __PUNCT__ that is how our economi ha grown __PUNCT__
not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
when we creat opportun for everybodi who work hard to get ahead __PUNCT__ thi economi grow __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ that choic __PUNCT__ you can see it in everi issu between myself and mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
when the auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ with a million worker and an icon american industri on the line __PUNCT__ i go to bet on the american worker __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ three year later __PUNCT__ gm is number on again and the american auto ha come roar back __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
so now i want to make sure that high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur take root not in china __PUNCT__ not in germani __PUNCT__ but here in the unit state __PUNCT__
i want to stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give those tax break to compani that ar invest here in chicago __PUNCT__ invest in cleveland __PUNCT__ invest in pittsburgh __PUNCT__
let creat job here in the unit state __PUNCT__ hire american worker __PUNCT__ make american product __PUNCT__ sell them around the world __PUNCT__ stamp with three proud word __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that after a decad of war __PUNCT__ we start do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i promis we end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ we end it __PUNCT__
i said we go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ we did __PUNCT__
now we begin a transit in afghanistan __PUNCT__ make afghan more respons for their own secur __PUNCT__ and bring our troop home __PUNCT__
all of thi is possibl onli becaus of the extraordinari men and women in uniform who protect our freedom everi singl dai at great sacrific to themselv __PUNCT__
but the question now is what countri ar thei come back to __PUNCT__ we want to give them a countri full of opportun __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ part of that mean make sure that we do right by them __PUNCT__
and as long as i am command in chief __PUNCT__ thei ar go to get the benefit that thei have earn __PUNCT__ becaus if you fought for america __PUNCT__ you shouldn't have to fight for a job or a roof over your head when you come home __PUNCT__
but it also mean make sure the economi is absorb all these folk who ar come home __PUNCT__ which mean i want to take about half of the monei that we were spend on war and let start invest it here in rebuild our school and road and bridg __PUNCT__
let make sure that we put teacher back to work __PUNCT__
there is so much that we can do with the save that we had and it will make america stronger __PUNCT__ it will make america safer not just for the next __NUM__ year or the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but for decad to come __PUNCT__
that the america we want to build __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to make sure we got the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
so i want to help local school district __PUNCT__ i want to help local school district hire and retain the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more peopl the opportun to go to commun colleg and get train for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure __PUNCT__ build on the work that we alreadi done __PUNCT__ that we make colleg afford __PUNCT__ not onli by make sure that we continu to expand our effort in pell grant and student loan __PUNCT__ but also that we make sure that colleg and univers ar keep their cost down __PUNCT__
becaus higher educ is no longer a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ and we got to fight for it __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
on everi issu __PUNCT__ there is a stark contrast __PUNCT__
when it come to homeownership __PUNCT__ my oppon sai __PUNCT__ just let the foreclosur bottom out __PUNCT__
that not a solut __PUNCT__
i want to make sure that homeown across american can refin at histor low rate __PUNCT__ save __MONEY__
how mani peopl here can us an extra __MONEY__ that would strengthen the hous market and put monei in peopl pocket that will make the economi stronger __PUNCT__
my oppon sai that we should go back to the dai when folk went broke becaus thei got sick __PUNCT__
he want to kill the afford care act __PUNCT__ also known affection as obamacar __PUNCT__
i believ that it wa the right thing to do for young peopl to be abl to stai on their parent plan __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million young peopl have insur that didn't have it befor __PUNCT__
i think it wa the right thing to do to make sure that folk without preexist condit ar abl to get health insur __PUNCT__
i think it is the right thing to do for senior to get discount on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
i think it the right thing to do for everybodi to be abl to get prevent care __PUNCT__ includ women who can have some control over their own health care decis __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we did the right thing to end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
we not go back __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
we did the right thing help out __PUNCT__ dream act __PUNCT__ kid __PUNCT__
we not go to go backward __PUNCT__ we not go to go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
across the board __PUNCT__ on these issu __PUNCT__ all of these thing __PUNCT__ whether we talk about manufactur __PUNCT__ a fair tax code __PUNCT__ a strong hous market __PUNCT__ afford colleg __PUNCT__ a k __PUNCT__ __NUM__ system that work __PUNCT__ all these thing stitch togeth __PUNCT__
it ha to do with how do we creat secur for middl class folk and how do we creat ladder of opportun for everybodi __PUNCT__
that how we alwai grown thi economi __PUNCT__
that is at the heart of what we believ __PUNCT__ that everybodi who work hard ha a shot __PUNCT__ that everybodi get a fair shot __PUNCT__ everybodi doe their fair share __PUNCT__ everybodi plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__ a belief that we ar in thi togeth __PUNCT__ that we ar not all on our own __PUNCT__
that the vision that we put forward in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that is the vision that we ar fight for in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just close up by sai thi __PUNCT__

that goe by quick __PUNCT__
and as you get older __PUNCT__ as you get to be like __NUM__ __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you will find out it goe by even quicker __PUNCT__
and dure thi time we will see the other side spend more monei through these super pac than we ever seen __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei ar write __MONEY__ million check __PUNCT__ just __PUNCT__ thei ar just crank it out __PUNCT__
if you live in a battleground state __PUNCT__ you cannot get awai from their advertis __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason thei have to advertis like thi is becaus thei know their econom theori don't sell __PUNCT__
thei know __PUNCT__ we didn't get amnesia __PUNCT__
we rememb try what thei sell __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so thei basic just go to repeat over and over again __PUNCT__ the economi is not good and it obama fault __PUNCT__
thei have variat on the theme __PUNCT__ but it the same thing over and over again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ that mai be a plan to try to win an elect __PUNCT__ but it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to strengthen the economi __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
it not a plan to make america stronger __PUNCT__
it feed into fear and the cynic that so mani american feel about washington __PUNCT__ but it not a plan for hope __PUNCT__
it not __PUNCT__ it doesn't captur america at it best __PUNCT__ a big __PUNCT__ bold __PUNCT__ gener __PUNCT__ optimist america __PUNCT__
and so the good new is we been outspent befor __PUNCT__ i been count out befor __PUNCT__ but what ha alwai given me faith __PUNCT__ what given me hope __PUNCT__ what given me confid is you __PUNCT__
it all of you __PUNCT__
it the fact that when the american peopl come togeth __PUNCT__ thei cannot be stop __PUNCT__
when peopl power is har __PUNCT__ when you gui ar out there knock on door __PUNCT__ make thing happen __PUNCT__ you can't be stop __PUNCT__
