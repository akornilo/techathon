and so i just want to thank all of you for be so welcom __PUNCT__
thi is my last polit campaign __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i term limit __PUNCT__
that the wai it work __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and it got me think about some of my first polit campaign __PUNCT__ when i wa first run for the state senat __PUNCT__
and craig will rememb thi becaus we have to go to kinko to print out flyer __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and he be draft __PUNCT__ along with michel and some friend __PUNCT__ and we just go around neighborhood knock on door __PUNCT__
and then later __PUNCT__ when i ran for the unit state senat __PUNCT__ which wa a loftier offic __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ but i didn't have a loftier infrastructur around me __PUNCT__ so we didn't have marin on __PUNCT__ we did not have air forc on __PUNCT__
i drove myself in my car __PUNCT__ usual with on staff person __PUNCT__
and back then __PUNCT__ young peopl __PUNCT__ you will not rememb thi __PUNCT__ but there were these thing call map __PUNCT__ becaus we did not have gp __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and so __PUNCT__ and thei were on paper __PUNCT__ and you have to fold them __PUNCT__
you unfold them and then try to fold them back wa realli difficult __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and i get lost becaus illinoi is a big state __PUNCT__ and i take the wrong turn and wind up in the wrong town __PUNCT__
and when i final got to the event __PUNCT__ i have to look for my own park spot and __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you end up be late __PUNCT__ and sometim __PUNCT__ it would be rain __PUNCT__ and you had to see if you could find the umbrella somewher in the back with all the junk that wa there __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but i have such fond memori of those campaign becaus when i travel throughout illinoi __PUNCT__ you go to inner citi __PUNCT__ you go to rural __PUNCT__ small farm town __PUNCT__ you go to suburb __PUNCT__ you meet folk from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ everi race __PUNCT__ everi faith __PUNCT__ everi background __PUNCT__ everi incom level __PUNCT__ what i heard ar stori that remind me of my own famili stori __PUNCT__
so i see a retir veteran __PUNCT__ and he remind me of my grandfath __PUNCT__
and i think back about my grandfath fight in world war ii in patton armi __PUNCT__ and while my grandmoth wa work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__ and how when he came back __PUNCT__ he wa abl to go to colleg on the gi bill and my grandpar were abl to bui their first home with the help of an fha loan __PUNCT__
and i think about the incred journei that thei had travel becaus thei were lucki enough to live here in america __PUNCT__
and i meet a work coupl __PUNCT__
and i think about craig and michel parent __PUNCT__
their dad __PUNCT__ by the time i met him __PUNCT__ could bare walk becaus he had ms __PUNCT__ so he had to us two cane __PUNCT__
and he have to wake up an hour earlier than everybodi els just to get dress to make sure that he punch the clock on time __PUNCT__
he work a blue __PUNCT__ collar job at the water filtrat plant in chicago __PUNCT__
and craig and michel mom work as a secretari __PUNCT__
but thei had such strong valu and such love for their famili and such a sens of respons that thei were abl to give their kid everyth thei need to thrive and succe __PUNCT__
and i think back to what an incred countri it wa where craig mom and dad would be abl to watch him succe and michel becom the first ladi of the unit state __PUNCT__ eventu __PUNCT__
and i meet a singl mom and i think about my own mom __PUNCT__
my dad left befor i even knew him and so she had to rais me and my sister and work and go to school at the same time __PUNCT__
but becaus she wa abl to get grant and scholarship __PUNCT__ she wa abl not onli to get a great educ herself and __PUNCT__ ultim __PUNCT__ help women around the world develop themselv __PUNCT__ but she wa also abl to give me and my sister thi incred educ and these incred opportun __PUNCT__
and so everywher i go around illinoi __PUNCT__ and eventu __PUNCT__ everywher i went as a presidenti candid __PUNCT__ what i consist see is thi run thread __PUNCT__ thi core theme __PUNCT__ thi basic bargain that is at the heart of thi countri __PUNCT__
and it can be describ veri simpli __PUNCT__
it that here in america __PUNCT__ no matter what you look like __PUNCT__ no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ no matter what your last name is __PUNCT__ no matter where you worship __PUNCT__ here in america __PUNCT__ if you will to work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ if you ar act respons __PUNCT__ you can succe __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ thi basic notion that if you will to make an effort __PUNCT__ you can find a job that pai a live wage and allow you to support a famili __PUNCT__ that you can get a home that you can call your own __PUNCT__ that you can have the secur that if somebodi in your famili get sick you won't go bankrupt __PUNCT__ that you can send your kid to a good school __PUNCT__ you can retir with some digniti and respect __PUNCT__ and that your kid can do better than you ever imagin __PUNCT__
that what america is about __PUNCT__
that what ha made us the envi of the world __PUNCT__ thi idea that here you can make it and that everybodi get a fair shot and that everybodi doe their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
that what built the greatest middl class in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
that what made us an econom superpow __PUNCT__
and i here todai for the same reason that i came __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
when i ran in __NUM__ it wa becaus that basic bargain __PUNCT__ that basic notion that you could make it here if you try __PUNCT__ that had start to slip awai for more and more peopl __PUNCT__
we gone through a decad in which peopl were work harder __PUNCT__ but make less monei __PUNCT__ while the cost of everyth from colleg educ to health care were go up __PUNCT__
we had fought two war on a credit card __PUNCT__
we had taken a surplu __PUNCT__ and becaus of tax cut that weren't paid for __PUNCT__ we had turn them into deficit __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in incred reckless on wall street that result in the worst financi crisi and econom crisi in our histori __PUNCT__
and so in an environ in which job and factori were be ship oversea and folk at the top were do veri well while middl class famili were struggl __PUNCT__ we came togeth sai that __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ it would take more than on year or on term or mayb even on presid to turn thi thing around __PUNCT__
but we were go to fight for the kind of chang that would ensur we got back to that basic american promis __PUNCT__ that basic idea that if you work hard in thi countri you can make it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi crisi ha been deeper and more brutal than __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ anybodi back then anticip __PUNCT__
but over the last 3Â½ year __PUNCT__ everyth i done __PUNCT__ everyth my administr ha done __PUNCT__ ha stai focus on that goal __PUNCT__
and so where we were lose __NUM__ job a month when i wa sworn into offic __PUNCT__ we been creat job now for almost __NUM__ year straight __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ __NUM__ in manufactur __PUNCT__ the fastest manufactur growth sinc the 1990 __PUNCT__
we help to make sure that small busi were abl to surviv thi brutal recess and invest in them __PUNCT__
and so we made progress __PUNCT__
but we still have million of folk who ar out of work and in home that ar underwat __PUNCT__ so we got a lot more work to do __PUNCT__
understand all that __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ when i hear cynic sai that __PUNCT__ or suggest that our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ i got to tell them __PUNCT__ you haven't wit the charact of the american peopl __PUNCT__
on of the great privileg of be presid is you meet peopl all across the countri __PUNCT__ just like i us to meet folk all across illinoi __PUNCT__
and when you see the charact and the grit and the determin of the american peopl __PUNCT__ you can't help but be optimist __PUNCT__
anybodi who think that our best dai ar behind us __PUNCT__ thei haven't met the small __PUNCT__ busi owner in minnesota who chose to sacrific some of their own perk and pai just to avoid lai off a singl worker dure the recess __PUNCT__
thei haven't been to auto plant in michigan or ohio that were never suppos to build anoth car again and now can't build them fast enough __PUNCT__
the cynic __PUNCT__ thei must not have met the worker that i meet __PUNCT__ a factori worker in her fifti in north carolina __PUNCT__ who decid that __PUNCT__ when the furnitur industri left town __PUNCT__ she get her degre in biotechnolog from a local commun colleg __PUNCT__ she said __PUNCT__ not just to get a job of the futur __PUNCT__ but also to show her kid that in thi countri __PUNCT__ we don't give up __PUNCT__
if we get knock down __PUNCT__ we pick ourselv back up __PUNCT__ and we can succe and achiev our dream __PUNCT__
so there ar no quick fix or easi solut to some of the challeng we face __PUNCT__
thei built up over decad __PUNCT__ and we have begun to move thi countri in the right direct __PUNCT__
but i have no doubt that we got the capac to meet everi singl on of these challeng __PUNCT__
we got the best worker in the world and the best entrepreneur __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and the best research __PUNCT__ the best colleg and the best univers __PUNCT__
we got the greatest divers of talent and ingenu that come from all around the globe __PUNCT__ everi corner __PUNCT__
and no matter what the naysay mai tell us __PUNCT__ there not a countri on earth that wouldn't trade place gladli with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
so what stand in our wai __PUNCT__ for all the progress we made __PUNCT__ what prevent us from make even more progress is polit __PUNCT__
it what go on in washington __PUNCT__
it is a stalem in which on side ha an uncompromis view that the onli path forward is to go back to the stuff that didn't work befor __PUNCT__ the same top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
i disagre with them __PUNCT__
i think thei ar wrong __PUNCT__
at stake in thi elect ar two fundament differ vision about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
thei believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
i believ in middl __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__
i believ in bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
i believ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__
that what i fight for __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let me give you a few exampl of the choic becaus all of you ar go to ultim be the on who break thi stalem __PUNCT__
tomorrow the senat is go to vote on a bill that sai that if you earn less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ your tax will not go up next year by a singl dime __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ member of both parti sai that thei agre thi should happen so that our famili and our busi have a littl more secur and certainti go forward __PUNCT__ which would be good for the economi __PUNCT__
but of cours __PUNCT__ we ar deal in washington __PUNCT__ the onli place where peopl agre on someth and still can't get it done __PUNCT__
so republican in congress __PUNCT__ thei decid appar that thei not go to let thi bill pass __PUNCT__
despit the fact that __NUM__ percent of american make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ so we could provid __NUM__ percent of american certainti that their tax would not go up __PUNCT__ despit the fact that thi would be good for the economi and invest climat __PUNCT__ thei decid to hold middl class tax cut hostag until we also agre to spend anoth __MONEY__ trillion on tax break for millionair and billionair __PUNCT__ folk who don't need tax break __PUNCT__ and frankli __PUNCT__ mani of them aren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ governor romnei doesn't just approv of thi strategi __PUNCT__ he want to import thi into the white hous __PUNCT__
hi econom plan is __PUNCT__ and thi is the entir gist of hi econom plan __PUNCT__ is to cut more tax for the most wealthi american __PUNCT__ to cut more regul for bank and corpor __PUNCT__ includ regul we just put in place in respons to the worst financi crisi we had in our lifetim __PUNCT__ to cut more invest in thing like educ and research __PUNCT__ all with the hope that somehow thi is go to creat more job and prosper __PUNCT__
that what mitt romnei believ __PUNCT__ that what hi alli in congress believ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there on problem with that __PUNCT__
it is an econom theori __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the hitch is that we tri thi __PUNCT__
as bill clinton put it a coupl of week ago __PUNCT__ thi is exactli what wa done befor i took offic __PUNCT__ except on steroid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and it didn't work __PUNCT__
so it not what you believ will grow the economi __PUNCT__
it not what i believ will grow the economi __PUNCT__
it not what most american __PUNCT__ regardless of parti __PUNCT__ believ will grow the economi __PUNCT__
thi countri wa not built that wai __PUNCT__ from the top down __PUNCT__
it wa built from the middl out __PUNCT__
it wa built from the bottom up __PUNCT__
it wa built becaus incred self __PUNCT__ relianc and rug individu and entrepreneurship and risk __PUNCT__ take wa reward __PUNCT__
and it wa built becaus we invest in great school and great univers and we put rule of the road in place to make sure that everybodi wa be treat fairli __PUNCT__
that how we becam the most prosper nation on earth __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ to go back to what work __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ let me just point out that the approach that i talk about ha also been test __PUNCT__
just like their theori have been test and didn't work __PUNCT__ my theori have been test __PUNCT__
the last time thei were tri wa by a gui name bill clinton __PUNCT__
and we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ went from deficit to surplu __PUNCT__ and we creat a lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the well __PUNCT__ off did well becaus thei had a lot of custom __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that how we grown our economi __PUNCT__
in some wai __PUNCT__ the other side understand that their theori aren't particularli popular __PUNCT__
so rather than explain them clearli __PUNCT__ thei go to spend most of their time try to distort what i sai __PUNCT__
earlier todai governor romnei wa at it again __PUNCT__
he ha been twist my word around to suggest that i don't valu small busi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ in polit __PUNCT__ you have to endur a certain amount of spin __PUNCT__
everybodi doe it __PUNCT__
i understand that __PUNCT__
those ar the game that ar plai in campaign __PUNCT__
although i have to sai __PUNCT__ when peopl omit entir sentenc from a speech __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and thei start splice and dice __PUNCT__ thei mai have tip a littl bit over their ski __PUNCT__
thei mai have gone over the edg here __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ hi tax return __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
but there a real choic here __PUNCT__
as i said __PUNCT__ i believ with all my heart that it is the drive and ingenu of american who start busi that lead to their success __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that why i cut tax on small busi __NUM__ time sinc i been presid __PUNCT__
i believ the abil for somebodi who is will to work hard and sweat and sacrific to turn their idea into a profit busi __PUNCT__ that what make us such a robust __PUNCT__ dynam economi __PUNCT__
we prize that __PUNCT__
but i also believ that if you talk to ani busi owner __PUNCT__ small or larg __PUNCT__ thei tell you what also help them succe alongsid their hard work __PUNCT__ their initi __PUNCT__ their great idea __PUNCT__ is the abil to hire worker with the right skill and the right educ __PUNCT__
what help them succe is the abil to ship and sell their product on new road and bridg and port and wireless network __PUNCT__
what help them succe is have access to cut __PUNCT__ edg technolog __PUNCT__ which like the internet often start with publicli fund research and develop __PUNCT__
and what help them succe is a strong and grow middl class so thei got a broader base of custom __PUNCT__
and for two centuri __PUNCT__ we made these invest __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ but republican as well __PUNCT__
thi wa an american idea __PUNCT__ the idea that what it take to give our peopl and busi the best possibl chanc at success involv individu initi __PUNCT__
but it involv us work togeth as a nation to creat these platform for success __PUNCT__ to expand opportun __PUNCT__
and mr __PUNCT__ romnei disagre with thi __PUNCT__ and he is entitl to hi opinion __PUNCT__
but the approach that he is talk about is not go to help small busi __PUNCT__ and it not go to creat more market for larg busi __PUNCT__
he is wrong __PUNCT__
we did not build thi countri on our own __PUNCT__
we built it togeth __PUNCT__
and if mr __PUNCT__ romnei doesn't understand that __PUNCT__ then he doesn't understand what it take to grow thi economi in the __NUM__ centuri for everybodi __PUNCT__
let me give you anoth exampl __PUNCT__ becaus thi is go to be discuss over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the issu of debt and deficit __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we got to reduc our debt __PUNCT__ and we got to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ when i came into offic __PUNCT__ had a trillion dollar of deficit wait at my doorstep __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ the recess made it wors __PUNCT__
but we got to take thi serious over the long term __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ how do we reduc it in a balanc wai that promot econom growth __PUNCT__ i believ you can't reduc the deficit without ask folk like me who have been incred bless by thi countri to give up a littl bit of the tax cut that thei been enjoi for a decad __PUNCT__ particularli sinc we the on who gain most of the growth in product over the last decad or two __PUNCT__
we done well __PUNCT__
we can afford to give a littl back __PUNCT__
so i go to cut govern spend that we can't afford __PUNCT__
not everi govern program work __PUNCT__
it got to be test __PUNCT__
and if it doesn't work __PUNCT__ if it not help to grow the economi and give peopl opportun __PUNCT__ we can't afford it in thi environ __PUNCT__
but i also go to ask folk who make over __MONEY__ a year to go back to the tax cut __PUNCT__ or the tax rate that we had under bill clinton __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mitt romnei ha a differ theori __PUNCT__
he actual want to cut tax by an addit __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
and the math is hard to figur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ it hard to figur how you reduc the deficit by blow an addit __MONEY__ hole in the deficit __PUNCT__
and the onli wai you can pai for it is not onli to slash and gut invest in educ and research and infrastructur __PUNCT__ it not onli cut back on the social safeti net for vulner famili __PUNCT__ it not onli that you got to voucher medicar __PUNCT__ as he propos __PUNCT__ but you also ultim over the long term end up have to impos a greater tax burden on the middl class __PUNCT__
that not how to grow the economi __PUNCT__
that part of the debat that we go to be have over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
and if you ask most american and you break it down in that wai __PUNCT__ thei agre that we should not see a bunch of teacher layoff or middl class tax go up to pai for a tax break for me __PUNCT__
that part of the reason i run for a second term as presid __PUNCT__
let me tell you some thing that will work __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps and more than __NUM__ million job were on the line __PUNCT__ governor romnei said __PUNCT__ let __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said let bet on american worker and american ingenu __PUNCT__ and now gm is back on top __PUNCT__
and ford and chrysler ar build more car than ever __PUNCT__
and so what i said is __PUNCT__ let not stop at detroit __PUNCT__
let not stop at the auto industri __PUNCT__
let make sure that we promot american advanc manufactur all across the countri __PUNCT__
and let chang our tax code so that we ar provid tax break to compani not that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ let give tax break to compani that ar invest right here in oregon __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ and put american worker back to work make american product __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
i run becaus after a decad of war __PUNCT__ i think it time for us to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
that will grow our economi __PUNCT__
becaus of the outstand effort of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__ we were abl to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ as i promis __PUNCT__
becaus of their outstand effort __PUNCT__ we were abl to refocu on those who actual carri out the 9/11 attack __PUNCT__
and al qaida is on the run __PUNCT__ and we got bin laden __PUNCT__
in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we blunt the taliban momentum __PUNCT__ and now we ar begin to transit so that afghan ar in the lead for their own secur __PUNCT__ and we ar begin to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
and so now the question is __PUNCT__ what ar thei come home to __PUNCT__ as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ thi countri will serv and care for our veteran the same wai that thei serv us __PUNCT__ becaus nobodi who fought for american should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when thei come home __PUNCT__
but what will also help our veteran is what will help our entir economi __PUNCT__ and that is make the invest that will help us grow __PUNCT__
i want to take half of the monei that we save on war __PUNCT__ and let put peopl back to work __PUNCT__ a whole bunch of hard hat out there __PUNCT__ rebuild our road and our bridg and our school __PUNCT__ lai broadband line into rural commun __PUNCT__ expand our wireless network __PUNCT__ build high __PUNCT__ speed rail __PUNCT__
that what go to help build america __PUNCT__
i run to make sure that america onc again lead the world when it come to educ our kid __PUNCT__
i want to help our school hire and train and retain the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to creat __NUM__ million more slot for commun colleg to train worker __PUNCT__ includ folk who been laid off __PUNCT__ for the job that local busi ar hire right now __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that we continu to work on reduc the cost of colleg for everi young person in america __PUNCT__ becaus in the __NUM__ centuri a higher educ is not a luxuri __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess that everybodi should be abl to afford __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term __PUNCT__
we start to see glimmer of the hous market improv in some market __PUNCT__ but in a lot of place it still a big drag on the economi __PUNCT__
so what i said is let make sure that everi famili can refin at these histor low rate __PUNCT__ save an averag famili __MONEY__ which thei will then spend __PUNCT__ and we expand our economi and strengthen the hous market __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei propos is to let the foreclosur market bottom out __PUNCT__
i don't think that is a plan __PUNCT__ that is the problem __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ i believ that in america nobodi should go bankrupt becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
we pass the afford care act __PUNCT__
the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__
we ar now implement it __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million peopl will have health insur that didn't have it befor __PUNCT__
everybodi who ha health insur will have greater secur __PUNCT__
women will have control of their health care choic __PUNCT__
that the right thing to do __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
on almost everi issu __PUNCT__ there a contrast __PUNCT__
i believ we did the right thing in end __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
i believ that fair is a hallmark of thi countri __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei disagre when it come to __PUNCT__ don't ask __PUNCT__ don't tell __PUNCT__
but we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei want to get rid of fund for plan parenthood __PUNCT__
i think that is a bad idea __PUNCT__
i got two daughter __PUNCT__
i want them to control their own health care choic __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__ we go forward __PUNCT__
and all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it invest in clean energi and make sure that solar panel and wind turbin ar built here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ whether it make sure that health care is there for peopl who ar work hard and do the respons thing __PUNCT__ whether it make sure all our young peopl have access to the higher educ that thei need __PUNCT__ all these thing tie togeth __PUNCT__
it goe back to that central idea __PUNCT__ the promis that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can get ahead __PUNCT__ the same promis that our parent and our grandpar pass down to us and that we now have a respons to pass on to our children and our grandchildren __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side will spend more monei than we ever seen on ad __PUNCT__ almost all of them neg __PUNCT__
thei tell you the same thing that you been hear for month __PUNCT__
as i said __PUNCT__ thei can't sell their own idea __PUNCT__ so thei go to go after us __PUNCT__
and you can boil down their messag veri simpli __PUNCT__ the economi is still struggl __PUNCT__ and it obama fault __PUNCT__
that what thei will repeat __PUNCT__
there will be a lot of variat __PUNCT__ but that go to be their basic messag __PUNCT__
and that mai be a plan to win an elect __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan __PUNCT__ i do __PUNCT__
and although __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ when folk ar write __MONEY__ million check to run neg ad against you __PUNCT__ it get your attent __PUNCT__
i been outspent befor __PUNCT__
we been count out befor __PUNCT__
