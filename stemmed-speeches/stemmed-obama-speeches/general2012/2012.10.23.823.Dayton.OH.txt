in a world of new threat and challeng __PUNCT__ america need leadership that is strong and steadi __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ governor romnei foreign polici ha been wrong and reckless __PUNCT__
you heard him last night __PUNCT__ he wa all over the map __PUNCT__

those troop would still be there todai instead of back home __PUNCT__
last night he claim to support my plan to end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ but he oppos a timelin that would actual bring the rest of our troop home __PUNCT__
last night he said take out bin laden wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__

if you talk about how much you love teacher dure a debat __PUNCT__ but just a few week ago you said we shouldn't hire ani more becaus it won't grow our economi __PUNCT__ you might have romnesia __PUNCT__
if you sai you won't give a big tax cut to the wealthi __PUNCT__ but you on a video promis your tax cut would includ the top __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that sound like a classic case of romnesia __PUNCT__
if you sai that you love american car dure a debat __PUNCT__ you a car gui __PUNCT__ but you wrote an articl titl __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__ you definit have a case of romnesia __PUNCT__
last night governor romnei look you right in the ey __PUNCT__ look me in the ey __PUNCT__ and tri to pretend that he never said __PUNCT__ let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__

if mitt romnei had been presid when the auto industri wa on the verg of collaps __PUNCT__ we might not have an american auto industri todai __PUNCT__

there no more seriou issu in a presidenti campaign than trust __PUNCT__
trust matter __PUNCT__
you want to know that the person who appli to be your presid and command in chief is trustworthi __PUNCT__ that he mean what he sai __PUNCT__ that he not just make stuff up depend on whether it conveni or not __PUNCT__
so smart peopl who __PUNCT__ thei don't have a dog in thi fight __PUNCT__ thei crunch the number __PUNCT__ and we know that governor romnei job plan doesn't realli creat job __PUNCT__
we know hi deficit plan doesn't realli reduc the deficit __PUNCT__
hi foreign polici is from the 1980 __PUNCT__ befor the cold war wa over __PUNCT__
hi social polici is from the 1950 __PUNCT__ and hi econom polici ar from the 1920 __PUNCT__
