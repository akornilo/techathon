and pleas give dave a big round of applaus for the great introduct __PUNCT__
dave mai have mention he is a music teacher __PUNCT__
and i told him that malia and sasha have been practic their piano __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and malia plai a littl flute __PUNCT__
but he mention that he thought __PUNCT__ he had heard me sing __PUNCT__ and he thought that i had realli good pitch __PUNCT__
so i __PUNCT__ so dave sai he got a band __PUNCT__ and mayb after i finish with the presid __PUNCT__ he said mayb i could be front man for the band __PUNCT__
he said i might be __PUNCT__ mayb i could be lead singer __PUNCT__
that would be all right __PUNCT__
but listen __PUNCT__ it is wonder to be back in iowa __PUNCT__
it is wonder to see some familiar face and some good friend on a beauti summer dai __PUNCT__
it wa on your front porch and in some of your backyard where our movement for chang start __PUNCT__
we spent a lot of time in iowa __PUNCT__ and i felt like an adopt son of iowa __PUNCT__
we were on __PUNCT__ we took bu tour all throughout the state __PUNCT__ although i got to admit the bu wasn't as nice as the on i got now __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and we went to school gym and famili farm and small busi all across the state __PUNCT__
but here the thing __PUNCT__ our journei is not over __PUNCT__
it not done __PUNCT__
so i go to spend the next __NUM__ dai drive all the wai across the state __PUNCT__ just like we did in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ from council bluff all the wai to the quad citi __PUNCT__ and i go to work just as hard __PUNCT__ mayb harder __PUNCT__ in thi campaign as i did in the last on __PUNCT__ becaus the choic that you face in __DATE__ couldn't be bigger __PUNCT__
it is not just a choic between two candid or two polit parti __PUNCT__
but more than ani elect in recent memori __PUNCT__ thi is a choic between two fundament differ vision about how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
and the direct that we choos __PUNCT__ the direct that you choos when you walk into that vote booth in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ is go to have an impact not just on your live __PUNCT__ but on the live of these young peopl here __PUNCT__ the live of your children __PUNCT__ live of your grandchildren for decad to come __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__
when we came togeth __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ and it wasn't just democrat __PUNCT__ we had independ and some republican get involv __PUNCT__ the idea wa to restor the basic bargain that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ the basic idea that sai if you work hard in thi countri __PUNCT__ then you can get ahead __PUNCT__ that if you put in the effort and you ar respons __PUNCT__ then you can find a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__
you can have a home that you call your own __PUNCT__
you won't go bankrupt when you get sick __PUNCT__
you can retir with some digniti and some respect __PUNCT__
and mayb most importantli __PUNCT__ you know that your kid can get a great educ and thei can dream bigger and do even better than you did __PUNCT__
that is the core of the american dream __PUNCT__
that the american promis __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the problem is __PUNCT__ is that we had gone through a decad where that promis wasn't be met __PUNCT__ it wasn't be kept __PUNCT__
so we had gone through a decad where job were be ship oversea __PUNCT__ where you were work harder __PUNCT__ but you were bring in less __PUNCT__
cost of colleg __PUNCT__ cost of health care were all go up __PUNCT__ cost of food __PUNCT__ cost of ga all were go up __PUNCT__
we ran two war on a credit card __PUNCT__
tax cut we didn't need and that didn't creat job __PUNCT__
and it all culmin in the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
so we knew that meet these challeng that had been build up for over a decad __PUNCT__ that it wasn't go to be easi __PUNCT__
we knew it wa go to take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
but what we also knew wa that american ar tougher than tough time __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ even though thi crisi that hit us in __NUM__ and __NUM__ wa bad __PUNCT__ even though a lot of folk lost their job and a lot of folk lost home and a lot of folk lost save __PUNCT__ so that the middl class felt even more under the gun than thei were befor __PUNCT__ what we knew wa that the american peopl ar resili and we ar tough __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ for the last 3½ year __PUNCT__ we roll up our sleev __PUNCT__ and we work hard __PUNCT__
and small busi have kept their door open __PUNCT__
and folk __PUNCT__ even if thei got laid off __PUNCT__ thei retrain to find new job __PUNCT__
and we creat 4½ million new job __PUNCT__ half a million more in manufactur __PUNCT__
the auto industri is back on top __PUNCT__
and so we made progress but we got a lot more work to do __PUNCT__
we got a lot more work to do __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
we can do it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
we can do it __PUNCT__

now __PUNCT__ here the thing __PUNCT__
some peopl __PUNCT__ thei naysay __PUNCT__ and thei sai __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ america is on declin __PUNCT__
and thei try to paint thing as dark as possibl __PUNCT__ especi dure elect time __PUNCT__
but here what i want everybodi to know __PUNCT__ we got so mani thing go for us compar to the rest of the world __PUNCT__
we still got the best worker in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and the best research in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and the best univers in the world __PUNCT__
we know how to work hard __PUNCT__
and we a young countri __PUNCT__ and we a countri that draw on the divers of folk who want to come here from all around the world to be part of thi american dream __PUNCT__
and most importantli __PUNCT__ the crisi ha not chang our charact __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang who we ar __PUNCT__
it hasn't chang our sens of determin and our sens of neighborli and our understand that we in thi thing togeth __PUNCT__
and so we come togeth __PUNCT__ just like we did in __NUM__ becaus our mission is not yet finish __PUNCT__
we ar here to build an economi where hard work pai off __PUNCT__
and so no matter who you ar or what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try here in america __PUNCT__
that what thi campaign is about and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__

we go to have to keep work __PUNCT__
we go to meet these challeng __PUNCT__
but the main problem we got is not a lack of good idea __PUNCT__
it not that we don't have good solut to our problem __PUNCT__
the big problem we got right now is polit in washington __PUNCT__
the big problem we got is on parti just think that compromis is a dirti word __PUNCT__
and thei got an econom theori that basic want to go back to the old top __PUNCT__ down econom that got us into thi mess in the first place __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ over the weekend my oppon chose as hi run mate the ideolog leader of the republican in congress __PUNCT__
and i gotten to know congressman ryan __PUNCT__
he a good man __PUNCT__
he a famili man __PUNCT__
he a veri articul spokesperson for governor romnei vision __PUNCT__
the problem is __PUNCT__ it the wrong vision for america __PUNCT__
it a vision that i fundament disagre with __PUNCT__
their main recip for solv america problem is get rid of regul on big corpor and big bank and then give more tax break to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
and their theori is that somehow that go to lead to job and prosper for everybodi __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the centerpiec of governor romnei entir econom plan __PUNCT__ you heard thi from dave __PUNCT__ is a new __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__ a lot of it go to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ these ar the folk who sai the deficit and the debt ar the biggest problem we got __PUNCT__
and yet thei now want to give a __MONEY__ trillion tax cut __PUNCT__
i know these number get so big __PUNCT__ but i just want you to get a sens __PUNCT__ our entir defens budget annual is __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
so what thi mean is __PUNCT__ a __MONEY__ trillion tax break over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ that the equival of the entir defens budget go out as a tax cut everi singl year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind that thi is go disproportion to the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ we found out that governor romnei expect you __PUNCT__ middl class famili __PUNCT__ to pick up the tab for thi big tax cut __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

you can go to their web site and look at their plan __PUNCT__
and then independ economist have look at thi thing __PUNCT__ and thei said that governor romnei tax plan would actual rais tax on middl class famili with children by an averag of __MONEY__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ keep in mind __PUNCT__ thi is not __MONEY__ to reduc the deficit or to grow job or to invest in educ or make colleg more afford or to rebuild our road __PUNCT__
thi is __MONEY__ to give anoth __MONEY__ tax cut to peopl make more than __MONEY__ million a year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me just see a show of hand __PUNCT__

__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i look for a campaign contribut __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ thei have tri to sell us thi trickl __PUNCT__ down fairi dust befor __PUNCT__
and it did not work then __PUNCT__ it won't work now __PUNCT__
it not a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
it not a plan to cut the deficit __PUNCT__
and it not a plan to move our economi forward __PUNCT__
we don't need more tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
we don't need a tax cut for mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ we don't need a tax cut for me __PUNCT__
we need tax relief for middl class famili who ar out there work to make sure that their kid ar healthi and their kid can go to colleg __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid becaus i got a differ idea __PUNCT__
i got a differ idea than mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
when i came into offic __PUNCT__ i promis that i would cut middl class tax __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ i kept that promis __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
you did __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
when you hear these republican sai that __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ obama is all about spend and rais tax __PUNCT__ let me tell you __PUNCT__ the typic famili is pai __MONEY__ less in tax than when i came into offic __PUNCT__
that the truth __PUNCT__
that a fact __PUNCT__
so now i want to keep tax right where thei ar on the first __MONEY__ of everybodi incom __PUNCT__
so if your famili make __MONEY__ a year or less __PUNCT__ like __NUM__ percent of american __PUNCT__ you won't see your incom tax increas by a singl dime next year under my plan __PUNCT__
not on dime __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if you fortun enough to be in the other __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ you still get a tax cut for your first __MONEY__ worth of incom __PUNCT__
but after that __PUNCT__ we ask you to contribut a littl bit more so we can pai down our deficit and invest in thing like educ that help our economi grow __PUNCT__
i make sure the govern doe it part by cut awai spend we don't need __PUNCT__
we alreadi cut a trillion dollar of spend we didn't need __PUNCT__ and we can do more __PUNCT__
i want to do anoth trillion __PUNCT__ trillion and a half of cut __PUNCT__
but we also got to match that with folk like me and governor romnei do our fair share __PUNCT__
and all we ask is that we go back to the same rate that we paid under bill clinton __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ that wa a time when our economi creat nearli __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest budget surplu in histori __PUNCT__ and millionair did pretti good too __PUNCT__
see __PUNCT__ what happen is that when a teacher or a construct worker or a famili farmer or a receptionist or a nurs __PUNCT__ when thei got a littl extra monei __PUNCT__ what do you do __PUNCT__ you end up spend it on thing you need __PUNCT__
so mayb you haven't got a new car in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ you go out and bui a car __PUNCT__
or mayb the wash machin is broke __PUNCT__ and you decid to bui a new wash machin __PUNCT__
mayb you go out to a restaur on a special occas __PUNCT__
mayb you take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__
that monei goe into the economi __PUNCT__ busi have more custom __PUNCT__ thei hire more worker and everybodi is better off from top to bottom __PUNCT__
i don't believ in top __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
i believ in middl class __PUNCT__ out econom __PUNCT__
i believ in bottom __PUNCT__ up econom __PUNCT__
that how you grow an economi __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
there a differ between me and mr __PUNCT__ romnei on almost everi issu __PUNCT__
when the american auto industri wa on the brink of collaps __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ million job were on the line __PUNCT__ governor romnei said let let detroit go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i said let bet on the american worker __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ the american auto industri is back on top __PUNCT__
gm is number on again __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ so i want to make sure that high __PUNCT__ tech manufactur job ar take root right here in boon __PUNCT__ not in china __PUNCT__ not in germani __PUNCT__
governor romnei __PUNCT__ he like to tout hi privat sector experi __PUNCT__
but a lot of that experi is invest in compani that were call __PUNCT__ pioneer __PUNCT__ of outsourc __PUNCT__
we don't need more outsourc __PUNCT__ we need some insourc __PUNCT__
i want to take awai tax break __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__
let stop give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
let give those tax break to compani that ar invest right here in iowa __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
my oppon and i disagre when it come to homegrown energi like wind __PUNCT__
wind power is creat new job all across iowa __PUNCT__
but governor romnei sai he want to end the tax credit for wind energi produc __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ america gener more than twice as much electr from wind than when i took offic __PUNCT__
and the wind industri __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
the wind industri support about __NUM__ job right here in iowa __PUNCT__
without these wind energi tax credit __PUNCT__ those job ar at risk __PUNCT__ __NUM__ job across the countri would be at risk __PUNCT__
so my attitud is let stop give taxpay subsidi to oil compani that don't need them and let invest in clean energi that will put peopl back to work right here in iowa __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
i run becaus in __NUM__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and i did __PUNCT__
i promis to go after al qaida and bin laden __PUNCT__ and we did __PUNCT__
we put a timelin to get our troop out of afghanistan and put afghan in charg of their own secur __PUNCT__
so all of thi is possibl onli becaus of the extraordinari sacrific and servic of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
and we ar so proud of them __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we got to do right by them __PUNCT__
we got to make sure that we serv our veteran as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
that why we put more monei into the va __PUNCT__ make sure that folk ar get the benefit that thei have earn __PUNCT__ whether it the wound that ar seen or the wound that ar unseen __PUNCT__
but it also mean that after a decad of war __PUNCT__ we need to do some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home so that all our men and women in uniform ar come home to good __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__
that why i said let take half the monei that we were spend on war and let put folk back to work right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
let put them back to work rebuild school and rebuild road and rebuild bridg __PUNCT__
and let creat a veteran job corp to help hire veteran to becom cop and firefight in commun that need them the most __PUNCT__
that the america we want to build __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to make sure that onc again america ha the best educ system in the world __PUNCT__
so i want to help our school hire and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
i want to give __NUM__ million more american a chanc to go to commun colleg to get train for the job that busi ar hire for right now __PUNCT__
and we have a plan to push colleg and univers to bring down their cost of tuition __PUNCT__ becaus young peopl __PUNCT__ thei can't be burden with ten of thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ worth of debt when thei go to school __PUNCT__
a higher educ isn't a luxuri anymor __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and we ar go to help them get the educ that thei need __PUNCT__
across the board __PUNCT__ governor romnei and i just see the world differ __PUNCT__
when it come to hous __PUNCT__ i want to make sure that everybodi who hasn't yet taken advantag of these histor low interest rate ha a chanc to refin their home __PUNCT__
it can save folk up to __MONEY__
governor romnei plan __PUNCT__ he said just let the hous market bottom out __PUNCT__
that not a solut __PUNCT__ that part of the problem __PUNCT__
he ha got a differ view than i do in term of how we move thi countri forward __PUNCT__
when it come to health care __PUNCT__ i guess he us to agre with me becaus he had the same health care plan that i did in massachusett __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that plan is work pretti good __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ he sai he want to kill obamacar __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ first of all __PUNCT__ i don't mind it be call obamacar becaus __PUNCT__ it true __PUNCT__ i do care __PUNCT__
that why i pass the bill __PUNCT__
i do care __PUNCT__
i care about folk who have preexist condit and couldn't get insur __PUNCT__
that why we pass the bill __PUNCT__
i care about the 6½ million young peopl who can now stai on their parent plan becaus of thi bill __PUNCT__
i care about the senior who were pai too much for their prescript drug __PUNCT__
we close the doughnut hole becaus of thi bill and lower their prescript drug cost __PUNCT__
so i don't believ that you should go broke when you get sick in thi countri __PUNCT__
and i work with anybodi who want to continu to improv our health care system __PUNCT__
but the suprem court ha spoken __PUNCT__ the law is here to stai __PUNCT__
we not spend the next __NUM__ year refight that battl __PUNCT__
we move forward __PUNCT__
we not go backward __PUNCT__
that a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ boon __PUNCT__ all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it bring manufactur job back __PUNCT__ put folk back to work in construct __PUNCT__ protect your health care __PUNCT__ make sure our kid ar get the best educ possibl and thei can afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ all these thing that make up that american dream __PUNCT__ that make up a middl class life __PUNCT__ thei all tie togeth __PUNCT__
thei central to that idea that made thi countri great __PUNCT__ the promis that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you get ahead __PUNCT__ that everybodi ha a fair shot and everybodi is do their fair share and everybodi is plai by the same set of rule __PUNCT__
it the promis that our parent and our grandpar pass down to us __PUNCT__
that the promis that allow me __PUNCT__ the child of a singl mom __PUNCT__ to becom presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it the promis that allow michel __PUNCT__ whose dad wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker and her mom wa a secretari __PUNCT__ to becom the first ladi __PUNCT__
it the promis that all of you have seen in your own live __PUNCT__
and now it time for us to pass that down to our kid and our grandkid __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ over the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ the other side will spend more monei than you have ever seen run the same ad over and over again __PUNCT__ basic __PUNCT__ which sai __PUNCT__ the economi is not where it should be and it obama fault __PUNCT__
thei just repeat it over and over again __PUNCT__
thei got differ variat __PUNCT__ but it all the same theme __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
thei not right __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ thei not constrain by the fact __PUNCT__ in term of these ad that thei run __PUNCT__
thei just make stuff up __PUNCT__
and that mai be a plan to win the elect __PUNCT__ but the reason thei got to do that is becaus thei know thei don't have a plan to creat job __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to grow the economi __PUNCT__
thei don't have a plan to reviv the middl class __PUNCT__
what thei sell __PUNCT__ you not bui __PUNCT__
that why thei don't talk about it __PUNCT__
i got that plan __PUNCT__
and we can make it work __PUNCT__ but i go to need your help __PUNCT__
i got to make sure everybodi here is regist to vote __PUNCT__
i got to make sure everybodi is get their friend and their neighbor __PUNCT__ their famili member to regist to vote __PUNCT__

but the reason i love thi state is becaus all of you gave me a chanc __PUNCT__
i had a chanc to talk to you and meet you and share stori with you __PUNCT__
and i us to sai back in __NUM__ that i not a perfect man and i won't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but i told you i alwai tell you what i thought __PUNCT__ alwai tell you where i stood __PUNCT__ and i fight everi singl dai as hard as i knew how for you __PUNCT__
and the reason is becaus i see myself in you __PUNCT__

and we know what it like to work and to fight hard to get ahead __PUNCT__
