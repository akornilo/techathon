i mean __PUNCT__ washington a beauti place __PUNCT__ and thei give me a veri nice __PUNCT__ rental hous there __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but when you get a chanc to get out and talk to folk __PUNCT__ it remind me of my first campaign __PUNCT__
i now on my last campaign __PUNCT__ but i still __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
i still rememb when i wa first run for the state senat in illinoi __PUNCT__
and a lot of peopl thought __PUNCT__ why do you want to do someth like that __PUNCT__ and i tri to explain to peopl my motiv __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ in illinoi __PUNCT__ when you a state legisl __PUNCT__ you don't get paid a lot of monei and you have to travel down to springfield __PUNCT__ which is __NUM__ hour __PUNCT__ drive awai __PUNCT__
but the reason i told folk that i did it wa becaus i thought back to my own life __PUNCT__
i thought back to the fact that my grandpar particip in world war ii __PUNCT__
my grandfath fought in patton armi __PUNCT__ and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ she wa rosi the rivet __PUNCT__
she work on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
and when thei got __PUNCT__ when my grandfath got back from the war and my mother had just been born __PUNCT__ he wa abl to get a colleg educ on the gi bill __PUNCT__
and thei were abl to bui their first hous with the help of the fha __PUNCT__
and then i wa rais by a singl mom and the help of my grandpar __PUNCT__
but despit the fact that we never had a lot of monei __PUNCT__ thei were abl to send me to a great school and i wa abl to get a wonder educ __PUNCT__
and i met thi beauti woman __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ just becaus i wa persist __PUNCT__ final gave up and gave in and decid to marri me __PUNCT__
but the reason that she wa abl to get a great educ __PUNCT__ becaus her __PUNCT__ michel dad wa __PUNCT__ he work as what wa call a stationari engin __PUNCT__
he wa a blue __PUNCT__ collar worker __PUNCT__ work at a pump station in chicago __PUNCT__
and her mom stai at home __PUNCT__ look after her and her brother __PUNCT__ and then work as a secretari __PUNCT__
but somehow __PUNCT__ her and her brother were abl to get a great educ __PUNCT__
and so our famili stori wa all about thi basic idea in america that if you work hard __PUNCT__ you can make it if you try __PUNCT__ here in thi countri __PUNCT__
that it doesn't matter what you look like __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter where you come from __PUNCT__ you don't have to be born into wealth __PUNCT__ you don't have to be born into fame __PUNCT__ if you will to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard __PUNCT__ then the basic bargain in thi countri is you can find a job that pai a decent wage __PUNCT__ and you should be abl to bui a home __PUNCT__ and you should be abl to retir with digniti and respect and not go bankrupt becaus you get sick __PUNCT__ and mayb take a vacat onc in a while __PUNCT__ noth fanci __PUNCT__ but be abl to spend time with your famili __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ you should believ that your kid ar go to be abl to do even better than you do __PUNCT__
and that idea __PUNCT__ that basic bargain __PUNCT__ is what brought me to polit __PUNCT__ becaus what i realiz wa that all the opportun that i had been get __PUNCT__ there were too mani young peopl out there who weren't get those same opportun __PUNCT__ folk who were work just as hard as my grandpar or my parent did __PUNCT__ that thei were find themselv make less monei work harder __PUNCT__ while the cost of health care or the cost of colleg or the cost of groceri were go up __PUNCT__
and so my belief wa that i had to particip and fight on behalf of the middl class that had given me so much __PUNCT__ so that the next gener would be abl to have those same opportun __PUNCT__
that what motiv me in my first campaign __PUNCT__
and as i travel all across illinoi to a lot of town like sanduski __PUNCT__ i meet peopl everywher and it didn't matter where thei came from __PUNCT__ what their background were __PUNCT__ thei had the same kind of stori to tell about how their famili had succeed in get that piec of the american dream __PUNCT__
and it what knit us togeth __PUNCT__ regardless of race __PUNCT__ regardless of statu __PUNCT__ regardless of religion __PUNCT__ that idea __PUNCT__ that what pull us togeth __PUNCT__
that what got me into my first campaign __PUNCT__ and it that same idea that i believ in __PUNCT__ in my last campaign __PUNCT__
it the reason i here todai __PUNCT__
it the reason i ran for presid __PUNCT__
it the reason that i run again for presid __PUNCT__ becaus i want to keep on fight for famili all across america so thei have the same opportun that i did __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ let me sai __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ when i start run __PUNCT__ we could alreadi see that thi american dream __PUNCT__ thi basic bargain wa slip awai for too mani peopl __PUNCT__
but what we didn't realiz at the time wa we were go to get hit by the worst econom crisi in most of our lifetim __PUNCT__
and we had to spend 3Â½ year recov and push back __PUNCT__
so when folk said __PUNCT__ let go ahead and let the auto industri go bankrupt __PUNCT__ we said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ let bet on american worker __PUNCT__
let bet on american industri __PUNCT__
and now gm is back on top and chrysler move and ford is go strong __PUNCT__
manufactur __PUNCT__ start to come back here in ohio and all across the countri __PUNCT__ some of the biggest manufactur job growth sinc the 1990 __PUNCT__
a lot of folk lost their job __PUNCT__ but a lot of folk have retrain __PUNCT__ and now thei go back and get job in renew energi and industri of the futur __PUNCT__
but for all the progress we made __PUNCT__ we still got a long wai to go __PUNCT__
there still too mani folk probabl here in sanduski who ar out of work __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl all across the countri whose home ar still out of water __PUNCT__ underwat and lost a lot of valu when the hous bubbl burst __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__
it not enough just to recov and get back to where we were befor the crisi __PUNCT__
we still got to address thi basic challeng of how do we build a strong middl class and make sure that the next gener ha the same opportun that we did __PUNCT__
and that a long __PUNCT__ term project __PUNCT__
it not go to happen overnight __PUNCT__
but we got to start work on it right now __PUNCT__
we got to move on that right now __PUNCT__
that the challeng we face __PUNCT__
it the central question of thi elect __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ we got two fundament differ vision in thi elect __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei and hi republican alli in congress __PUNCT__ some of those special interest that support him __PUNCT__ their basic vision sai if we just cut tax by about __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__ especi for the wealthiest american and we elimin all these regul that we put in place __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ to prevent anoth taxpay __PUNCT__ fund bailout __PUNCT__ that somehow wealthi investor will benefit and it will all trickl down and everybodi here will do better __PUNCT__
that their basic theori __PUNCT__
that their econom plan __PUNCT__
i not exagger __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ it on their web site __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ that __MONEY__ trillion tax cut that thei want to provid __PUNCT__ on top of the bush tax cut __PUNCT__ thei pai for it by cut educ and cut transport fund and cut basic research into thing like alzheim and cancer __PUNCT__ cut job train program __PUNCT__ turn medicar into a voucher program __PUNCT__ slash medicaid __PUNCT__
that their econom theori __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ here the problem __PUNCT__ we tri that __PUNCT__
we tri it befor i came into offic __PUNCT__
not onli did it not work __PUNCT__ it led to the worst financi crisi that we had in our lifetim __PUNCT__
why would we want to go back to someth that didn't work __PUNCT__ so we don't want to go backward __PUNCT__
and we got a differ vision __PUNCT__
it a vision that sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ govern can't solv everi problem __PUNCT__
on of the thing that i learn from my mom wa __PUNCT__ you can't replac a mother who love you and instil you with a sens of purpos and occasion get on you when you not do your homework __PUNCT__
so govern can't replac parent __PUNCT__
but when i first got my job as an organ for the cathol church in chicago __PUNCT__ work with parish in low __PUNCT__ incom neighborhood __PUNCT__ thei taught me that no govern program can replac good neighbor and peopl who care deepli about their commun who ar fight on their behalf __PUNCT__
so i don't believ the govern can solv everi problem __PUNCT__ and i don't think it should even try __PUNCT__
i don't __PUNCT__ i think you can't help folk if thei don't want to help themselv __PUNCT__
america wasn't built on handout __PUNCT__ it wa built on respons __PUNCT__
and we have to challeng everybodi to take individu respons in their own live __PUNCT__
but what we also understand __PUNCT__ and everybodi here ha an experi in their live that underscor thi __PUNCT__ what we also understand is there some thing that we do togeth that make all of us stronger __PUNCT__ that make all of us richer __PUNCT__
if we invest in good school and our kid ar get great educ __PUNCT__ that not just good for those kid __PUNCT__ that good for all of us __PUNCT__
if we put construct worker to work rebuild road and bridg __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ speed rail __PUNCT__ broadband line __PUNCT__ that not just good for those worker __PUNCT__ that creat a platform for everybodi to benefit __PUNCT__ everybodi to succe __PUNCT__
when we invest in basic research that help invent the internet or gp __PUNCT__ that give busi an opportun then to come in and take that new knowledg and creat new busi and creat job for everybodi __PUNCT__
that good for all of us __PUNCT__
so my vision sai __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ there ar some thing we have to do togeth __PUNCT__
and i run for a second term as presid becaus we have more to do __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to make sure that everi child get a high __PUNCT__ qualiti educ __PUNCT__ and that mean i want to hire new teacher in our classroom __PUNCT__ especi in math and scienc __PUNCT__
and i want to give __NUM__ million more peopl the opportun to get train at a commun colleg for job that exist right now and get the skill thei need __PUNCT__
and i want to make colleg more afford for everi young person who ha the initi and drive to go __PUNCT__ and make sure thei not burden by thousand of dollar __PUNCT__ worth of debt __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
i run for presid to make sure that america build again __PUNCT__ that we make stuff __PUNCT__
i told you manufactur is start to come back __PUNCT__ but we can do so much more __PUNCT__
right now we got tax law that give tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__
i want to give tax break to compani that ar invest right here in sanduski __PUNCT__ right here in the __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ right here in the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i run becaus i do want to rebuild our road and our bridg __PUNCT__
we got hundr of thousand of construct worker all across the countri who ar out of work __PUNCT__ and all the manufactur that goe into construct __PUNCT__
we could rebuild our road __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ our school __PUNCT__ renov our build so that thei more energi effici __PUNCT__ put a lot of peopl back to work __PUNCT__ and that good for the entir economi __PUNCT__
that mean more folk who ar eat at restaur __PUNCT__
that mean more folk ar out shop becaus thei got monei in their pocket __PUNCT__
and that benefit all of us __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to make sure __PUNCT__ now that we end the war in iraq and we wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ that we ar provid opportun for everi veteran __PUNCT__ becaus thei shouldn't have to fight for a job when thei come home __PUNCT__
and i want to take half of that monei to help reduc our debt __PUNCT__ and i want to take the other half that we were spend on war to rebuild america __PUNCT__
we need to do some nation __PUNCT__ build right here at home __PUNCT__
that why i run __PUNCT__
i run becaus the health care law that we pass wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
becaus if you alreadi have health insur __PUNCT__ insur compani can't drop you now becaus you had a __PUNCT__ becaus you sick or becaus you suddenli reach some lifetim limit __PUNCT__
and young peopl now ar abl to stai on their health insur __PUNCT__ your health insur until thei __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__
and senior citizen ar get more discount on their prescript drug __PUNCT__
and peopl who have preexist condit ar go to be abl to get health insur for the first time __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ we fought so hard to make that happen __PUNCT__ and now the suprem court ha rule __PUNCT__
it is time for us to move forward __PUNCT__
we don't need to reargu the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
i will to work with anybodi who want to make it work __PUNCT__ who want to improv health care in thi countri and lower cost for individu famili __PUNCT__
but i don't want to just keep on have polit argument that ar base on polit and not on fact __PUNCT__
i run becaus i want to implement the wall street reform law __PUNCT__
i don't want us to have to bail out wall street bank again __PUNCT__
thei got to act respons __PUNCT__
and we got to make sure that the rule ar in place so that thei don't act recklessli __PUNCT__
and i want to balanc our budget __PUNCT__ i want to reduc our deficit __PUNCT__ deal with our debt __PUNCT__ but i want to do it in a balanc __PUNCT__ respons wai __PUNCT__
it make no sens for us to provid me a tax cut __PUNCT__ i don't need it __PUNCT__ and then to cut teacher from our public school or to cut our aid to educ or to cut student loan and make them more expens for our young peopl __PUNCT__
i have had opportun __PUNCT__
i want to now give someth back __PUNCT__
and i think a lot of success peopl out there want to give someth back __PUNCT__
so we cut program that don't work __PUNCT__ and we keep elimin wast that doesn't make __PUNCT__ that doesn't improv prospect for the middl class __PUNCT__
but i not go to balanc the budget on the back of the poor or the disabl or the vulner or ask middl class famili to pai higher tax to pai for a tax cut for me or mr __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__
that not how we go to balanc our budget __PUNCT__
that not how we go to deal with our deficit __PUNCT__
so all these thing __PUNCT__ whether it health care __PUNCT__ whether it bring manufactur job back __PUNCT__ whether it make sure our kid get a great educ __PUNCT__ whether it make sure that we rebuild america and tap into american energi so we less depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ whether we take care of our veteran __PUNCT__ all these thing __PUNCT__ thei tie togeth __PUNCT__
thei go back to that first campaign i ran __PUNCT__ becaus thei have to do with make sure that what made thi countri great __PUNCT__ our big __PUNCT__ divers __PUNCT__ hope __PUNCT__ optimist __PUNCT__ hard __PUNCT__ work __PUNCT__ patriot middl class __PUNCT__ that we continu to grow that middl class for the futur __PUNCT__ that we continu to make folk who work hard a littl more secur and we provid that basic american promis to the next gener __PUNCT__
that the essenti project that got me into polit __PUNCT__
that why i ran for presid __PUNCT__
and that what built thi countri __PUNCT__
and i know that dure the cours of the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ you go to see a whole bunch of neg ad __PUNCT__
thei spend __PUNCT__ the other side spend more monei than ani time in histori __PUNCT__ and everi ad basic the same __PUNCT__
it basic sai the economi is no good and it obama fault __PUNCT__
thei basic have just on line __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and after a while __PUNCT__ even if you don't bui that balonei __PUNCT__ it can get discourag __PUNCT__
and after __PUNCT__ you start think __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ polit is just a dirti __PUNCT__ nasti busi __PUNCT__ and it not worth get involv __PUNCT__
and peopl get discourag __PUNCT__ and thei get cynic __PUNCT__
and you know what __PUNCT__ that what the other side is count on __PUNCT__ becaus when we get cynic and we don't particip __PUNCT__ then the folk who ar in power __PUNCT__ the folk who have the special interest lobbi __PUNCT__ the folk that ar spend all thi monei __PUNCT__ thei do just fine __PUNCT__
and so the thing that i want everybodi here to understand __PUNCT__ each of you person __PUNCT__ is that back in __NUM__ everybodi said we couldn't do it becaus we were outspent __PUNCT__ we weren't favor __PUNCT__
when a gui name barack obama run for presid __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ he is not the odd __PUNCT__ on favorit __PUNCT__
that first race that i ran as a state senat __PUNCT__ michel and i __PUNCT__ we go around knock on door __PUNCT__ pass out leaflet __PUNCT__
nobodi gave us a shot __PUNCT__
everybodi said __PUNCT__ nobodi can pronounc your name __PUNCT__ how ar you go to win __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ you don't come from a famou famili __PUNCT__
you don't __PUNCT__ we couldn't afford to advertis on tv __PUNCT__
and yet what we learn wa that when ordinari peopl come togeth __PUNCT__ when you believ in someth so deepli that you will to talk to your friend and talk to your neighbor and talk to your cowork __PUNCT__ knock on door and make phone call __PUNCT__ when the american peopl decid what right __PUNCT__ then all that monei doesn't matter __PUNCT__
all the tv advertis doesn't matter __PUNCT__
and that stalem that we have in washington __PUNCT__ where the other side is try to block everi singl thing we do and sai no to everyth __PUNCT__ the onli peopl that can break that stalem ultim is go to be you __PUNCT__
so i hope dure the next __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ i hope you rememb your famili stori __PUNCT__
i hope you rememb your parent and how hard thei work or your grandpar or your great __PUNCT__ grandpar __PUNCT__ mayb some of them immigr come to thi countri __PUNCT__ not know what to expect __PUNCT__ but understand if thei work hard thi wa a chanc where your dream could happen __PUNCT__
and i hope you think about what we have to do to make sure that that is pass on to the next gener __PUNCT__
and i want you to know that when i ran in __NUM__ i said i wasn't go to be a perfect man and i certainli wasn't go to be a perfect presid __PUNCT__ but i alwai tell you what i thought __PUNCT__
i alwai tell you where i stood __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ i would wake up everi singl dai think about you __PUNCT__ think about how to make your live a littl bit better __PUNCT__
becaus in you i see my own life and everyth that my parent and grandpar struggl for __PUNCT__
and i have kept that promis __PUNCT__
and i intend to keep that promis as long as i have the privileg of be your presid __PUNCT__
so if you will to stand with me and work with me and knock on some door with me and make some phone call with me __PUNCT__ i promis you we will finish what we start in __NUM__ and we will remind the world just why it is that the unit state of america is the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
