when it come to the economi __PUNCT__ it bad enough that our oppon want to take us back to the fail polici of the last decad __PUNCT__
when it come to a woman right to make her own health care choic __PUNCT__ thei want to take us back to the polici of the 1950 __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
thi elect is your chanc to make sure that doesn't happen __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__
the decis that affect a woman health aren't up to politician __PUNCT__ thei not up to insur compani __PUNCT__ thei up to you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ thei up to you __PUNCT__
you deserv a presid who will fight to keep it that wai __PUNCT__
that the presid i been __PUNCT__
that the presid i be if you give me a second term __PUNCT__
you don't have to take me at my word __PUNCT__ you can look at my record __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i said i pass health reform befor the end of my first term __PUNCT__
thank to your help __PUNCT__ that what we did __PUNCT__
the new health care law help make sure you don't have to worri about go broke just becaus you or a love on get sick __PUNCT__
insur compani can no longer put lifetim limit on your care or jack up your premium without reason or drop your coverag when you need it most __PUNCT__
thei can no longer discrimin against children with preexist condit __PUNCT__
and soon __PUNCT__ thei will no longer be abl to deni you coverag base on preexist condit like breast cancer or charg you more for the same care just becaus you a woman __PUNCT__
thi law ha alreadi allow nearli __NUM__ million young adult under the ag of __NUM__ to sign up and stai on their parent health care plan __PUNCT__
it alreadi save million of senior on medicar hundr of dollar on their prescript medicin __PUNCT__
and million of american have actual gotten a rebat from their insur compani if that compani __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you got on __PUNCT__ see __PUNCT__ i just want to sai __PUNCT__ she not a plant __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ she a support __PUNCT__ but i didn't know about __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but you get a rebat if the insur compani spent too much monei on administr cost and ceo bonus and not enough on your health care __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
thi law ha secur new access to prevent care like mammogram and cancer screen with no copai __PUNCT__ no deduct __PUNCT__ no out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ pocket cost for more than __NUM__ million women __PUNCT__
and now most health plan ar begin to cover the cost of contracept care __PUNCT__ which is vital for women health __PUNCT__
doctor prescrib contracept not onli for famili plan __PUNCT__ but as a wai to reduc the risk of ovarian and other cancer __PUNCT__
and it good for our health care system in gener becaus we know the overal cost of care is lower when women have access to contracept servic __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ befor thi new law __PUNCT__ mani health care plan charg high deduct or copai for these prevent servic __PUNCT__ or thei just didn't cover them that all __PUNCT__
accord to on studi __PUNCT__ more than half of all women put off the care thei need becaus of that __PUNCT__
how mani of you have gone without the care you need or the checkup you knew just becaus you were worri that the insur copai would go too high and you couldn't afford ga or groceri or your kid new soccer uniform __PUNCT__ so you have had to make choic and sacrific __PUNCT__
i don't think a work mom in arlington should have to wait to get a mammogram just becaus monei is tight __PUNCT__
i don't think a colleg student in fairfax or charlottesvil should have to choos between textbook or the prevent care that she need __PUNCT__
that why we pass thi law __PUNCT__ and i am proud of it __PUNCT__
it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__ and we ar go to keep it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ my oppon ha a differ view __PUNCT__
the other night __PUNCT__ he said he repeal obamacar as soon as he took offic __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__

and then __PUNCT__ i explain __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ your plan doesn't do that __PUNCT__
and then hi campaign had to come out and sai __PUNCT__ actual __PUNCT__ that not true __PUNCT__ our plan wouldn't do that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ so governor romnei wa fact __PUNCT__ check by hi own campaign __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ that rough __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that rough __PUNCT__
even thei know hi plan would take awai coverag for ten of million of american __PUNCT__
governor romnei said he get rid of plan parenthood fund __PUNCT__
appar __PUNCT__ thi __PUNCT__ along with big bird __PUNCT__ is drive the deficit __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ big bird __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ and he would have support an extrem measur in massachusett that would have outlaw some form of contracept __PUNCT__
he join the far right of hi parti to support a bill that would allow ani employ to deni contracept coverag to their employe __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ think about that __PUNCT__ your boss tell you what best for your health and safeti __PUNCT__
let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ virginia __PUNCT__ i don't think your boss should control the care you get __PUNCT__
i don't think insur compani should control the care you get __PUNCT__
i definit don't think politician on capitol hill should control the care you get __PUNCT__
we seen some of their attitud __PUNCT__

i think there on person who get to make decis about your health care __PUNCT__ that you __PUNCT__
my oppon ha call himself __PUNCT__ sever conserv __PUNCT__ but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__ there noth conserv __PUNCT__ as katherin made clear __PUNCT__ there noth conserv about a govern that prevent a woman from make her own health care decis __PUNCT__
governor romnei talk about freedom __PUNCT__ but freedom is the abil to determin the care you need __PUNCT__ when you need it __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
freedom is the abil to chang job or start your own busi without the fear of lose your health insur __PUNCT__
freedom is the knowledg that you no longer be charg more than men for the same health care or deni afford coverag just becaus you beat cancer __PUNCT__
and at a time when women make up nearli half the workforc and an increas share of famili breadwinn __PUNCT__ these ar not just health issu or women issu __PUNCT__ these ar econom issu that ar vital and affect everi famili in america __PUNCT__
thei matter __PUNCT__
when a woman is the main breadwinn for her famili __PUNCT__ but take home less pai for the same work as a man doe becaus she a woman __PUNCT__ that is not right __PUNCT__
when my oppon campaign wa ask if he support legisl give women the tool to fight for an equal dai pai for an equal dai work __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ we get back to you on that __PUNCT__
and sinc then __PUNCT__ he refus to explain hi posit __PUNCT__
you alreadi got my answer __PUNCT__ uphold the principl of equal pai for equal work __PUNCT__ that wa on of the first bill that i sign into law __PUNCT__
i name two extraordinari women who understand these issu on the suprem court __PUNCT__ the highest court in the land __PUNCT__
and rememb __PUNCT__ the next presid __PUNCT__ the next congress could tip the balanc of the court in a wai that turn back the clock for women and their famili for decad to come __PUNCT__
the choic between go backward and move forward ha never been so clear __PUNCT__
virginia __PUNCT__ we don't need a presid who promis to rubberstamp the top __PUNCT__ down agenda of the republican in thi congress __PUNCT__
we don't want to go backward __PUNCT__
we got to go forward __PUNCT__
from the dai we began thi campaign __PUNCT__ we alwai said that real chang take time __PUNCT__
it take more than on year or on term or even on presid __PUNCT__
it take more than on parti __PUNCT__
it certainli can't happen if you will to write off half the nation befor you even take offic __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ peopl forget __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ percent of the countri didn't vote for me __PUNCT__
but on the night of the elect __PUNCT__ i said to all those american __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__ i mai not have won your vote __PUNCT__ but i hear your voic and i need your help __PUNCT__ and i will be your presid too __PUNCT__
