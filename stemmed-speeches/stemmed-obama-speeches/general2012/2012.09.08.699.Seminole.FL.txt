after all that we have been through __PUNCT__ do we realli think that it would make sens to roll back regul on wall street __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__

i won't pretend the path i offer is quick or that it go to be easi __PUNCT__
i never have __PUNCT__
sometim __PUNCT__ i ask peopl to go back to __NUM__ and look at what i said __PUNCT__

bill clinton remind us on wednesdai night __PUNCT__ it go to take more than a few year to solv challeng that have been built up for decad __PUNCT__
but let me tell you someth __PUNCT__
when our oppon sai thi nation is in declin __PUNCT__ thei ar dead wrong __PUNCT__
thi is america __PUNCT__
we still have the best worker in the world and the best entrepreneur in the world __PUNCT__
we got the best scientist and the best research __PUNCT__
we got the best colleg and the best univers __PUNCT__
we ar a young nation with the greatest divers of talent and ingenu from everi corner of the globe __PUNCT__
so no matter what the naysay mai sai for polit reason __PUNCT__ no matter how dark thei try to make everyth look __PUNCT__ there not a countri on earth that wouldn't gladli trade place with the unit state of america __PUNCT__
and i am here to tell you our problem can be solv and our challeng can be met __PUNCT__
the path we offer mai be harder __PUNCT__ but it lead to a better place __PUNCT__
and i ask you to choos that futur __PUNCT__
i am ask you to ralli not just behind me __PUNCT__ but around a set of goal for your countri __PUNCT__ goal in manufactur and energi __PUNCT__ in educ and nation secur __PUNCT__ in reduc our deficit __PUNCT__
real __PUNCT__ achiev goal that will lead to new job and more opportun and rebuild thi economi on a stronger foundat __PUNCT__
that what we can do in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and that why i run for a second term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
that why i ask for __NUM__ more year __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i want you to __PUNCT__ in case you miss it __NUM__ dai ago __PUNCT__ i want to repeat in veri plain term what goal i talk about __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
go ahead __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
you sai i can go ahead __PUNCT__ okai __PUNCT__
i go to go ahead then __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ number on __PUNCT__ i got a plan to export more product and outsourc fewer job __PUNCT__
after a decad of declin __PUNCT__ thi countri ha now creat over half a million job in the last 2Â½ year alon just in manufactur __PUNCT__
that faster than ani time sinc the __PUNCT__ 90 __PUNCT__
we reinvent a dy auto industri that back on top of the world __PUNCT__
and now you got a choic __PUNCT__ we can keep give more tax break to compani that ar ship job oversea __PUNCT__ just like the other side is argu for __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
boo __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ or we can start reward compani that open new plant and train new worker and creat new job right here in florida __PUNCT__
we can help big factori and small busi doubl their export and creat a million new manufactur job in the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
you can make that happen __PUNCT__
that part on __PUNCT__
part two __PUNCT__ i got a plan to control more of our own energi __PUNCT__
after __NUM__ year of inact __PUNCT__ we rais fuel standard so that by the middl of the next decad __PUNCT__ your car and truck will go twice as far on a gallon of ga __PUNCT__
that will save you monei __PUNCT__
it will help the environ __PUNCT__
we doubl our us of renew energi __PUNCT__ and thousand of american now have job build wind turbin and long __PUNCT__ last batteri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the unit state of america is less depend on foreign oil than at ani time in nearli two decad __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
so we move to control our own energi __PUNCT__
the other side __PUNCT__ thei don't have a real plan __PUNCT__
so you got a choic between a plan that want to just revers the progress we made or on that build on it __PUNCT__
and let me tell you __PUNCT__ unlik my oppon __PUNCT__ i not go to let oil compani write thi countri energi plan or endang our coastlin or collect anoth __MONEY__ billion in corpor welfar from our taxpay __PUNCT__
we not go to let them do that __PUNCT__
we got a better path __PUNCT__
we go to invest in wind and solar __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
we go to help farmer and scientist har new biofuel to power car and truck __PUNCT__
we go to put construct worker back to work build home and factori that wast less energi and retrofit old build and home to us less energi __PUNCT__
we develop a hundr year __PUNCT__ suppli of natur ga that right beneath our feet __PUNCT__
if you choos thi path __PUNCT__ we can cut our import in half by __NUM__ and support more than __NUM__ new job in natur ga alon __PUNCT__
that the second part of the plan __PUNCT__
you want to hear the third __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
okai __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ i got a plan to give more american the chanc to gain the skill thei need to compet __PUNCT__
educ wa the gatewai to opportun for me and michel __PUNCT__
it the gatewai to a middl class life __PUNCT__
for the next time __PUNCT__ for the first time in nearli a gener __PUNCT__ everi state just about ha answer our call to rais their standard for teach and learn __PUNCT__
some of the worst school in the countri have made real gain in math and read __PUNCT__ includ here in florida __PUNCT__
million of student ar pai less for colleg todai __PUNCT__ includ student here __PUNCT__ becaus we took on a system that wa wast billion of dollar give student loan monei to bank and lender instead of directli to student __PUNCT__
so now you got a choic __PUNCT__
we can gut educ like these other folk were recommend __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
or we can decid that in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ no child should have her dream defer becaus of a crowd classroom or a crumbl school __PUNCT__
no famili should have to set asid a colleg accept letter becaus thei don't have the monei __PUNCT__
no compani should have to look for worker in china becaus thei couldn't find on with the right skill right here at home __PUNCT__
so help me recruit __NUM__ math and scienc teacher in the next __NUM__ year and improv earli childhood educ and give __NUM__ million worker the chanc to learn skill at that commun colleg that will lead directli to a job __PUNCT__
and let help work with colleg and univers to cut in half the growth of tuition cost over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ becaus higher educ is not a luxuri anymor __PUNCT__ it is an econom necess that everybodi should be abl to afford __PUNCT__
and we can meet that goal togeth __PUNCT__
you can choos that futur if you will to move forward with me __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ fourth __PUNCT__ my plan __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i got four __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ fourth __PUNCT__ my plan would reduc our deficit without stick it to the middl class __PUNCT__
we all concern about the deficit __PUNCT__
after two war __PUNCT__ two tax cut that weren't paid for __PUNCT__ we have a challeng that we got to now deal with __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
can't go back __PUNCT__
the presid __PUNCT__
can't go backward __PUNCT__
independ analysi show that the plan i put forward would cut our deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
and i alreadi work with republican to cut __MONEY__ trillion in spend __PUNCT__
i will to do more __PUNCT__
we got to make sure govern is lean __PUNCT__ and program that don't work __PUNCT__ we got to get rid of them so we can pai for the thing that do __PUNCT__
and i want to reform the tax code so that it is simpl and fair __PUNCT__ and so that it ask the wealthiest household to pai higher tax on incom over __MONEY__
keep in mind __PUNCT__ that mean if you a millionair __PUNCT__ you still get a tax __PUNCT__ you keep your tax cut for the first __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__ but after that __PUNCT__ you pai the same rate we had when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__ the same rate when we creat __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ the biggest surplu in histori and a whole lot of millionair to boot __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ the reason that i want to keep tax cut for middl class famili __PUNCT__ but i don't need on __PUNCT__ mitt romnei doesn't need on __PUNCT__ is becaus what happen when middl class famili __PUNCT__ when teacher and construct worker and receptionist __PUNCT__ what happen when folk have a littl monei in their pocket __PUNCT__ audienc member __PUNCT__
thei spend it __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
and when thei spend it that mean busi ha more custom __PUNCT__ and that mean busi make more profit __PUNCT__ which mean busi hire more worker __PUNCT__ who then spend more monei __PUNCT__
the whole economi get stronger __PUNCT__
not from the top down __PUNCT__ but from the middl out __PUNCT__ from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that how we grow an economi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that how we grow an economi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi week __PUNCT__ presid clinton point out the singl biggest thing miss from my oppon plan __PUNCT__ arithmet __PUNCT__
when governor romnei and hi alli tell us we can somehow cut our deficit by spend __MONEY__ trillion more on tax break for the wealthi __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ you do the math __PUNCT__
how is that go to work __PUNCT__ the fact is mr __PUNCT__ romnei plan and congressman ryan plan don't add up __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ thei don't add to job either __PUNCT__
thei like to talk about how we go to creat more job __PUNCT__
but economist who look at their plan sai thi would make the recoveri slower __PUNCT__ not faster __PUNCT__
i refus to let that happen __PUNCT__
i refus to ask middl class famili to give up their deduct for own a home or rais their kid just to pai for anoth millionair tax cut __PUNCT__
i refus to ask all the student here to pai more for colleg to pai for my tax cut __PUNCT__
i not go to kick children out of head start program or elimin health insur for million of american who ar poor or elderli or disabl __PUNCT__ all so those with the most can pai less __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ florida __PUNCT__ you should know i will never turn medicar into a voucher system __PUNCT__
no american should have to spend their golden year at the merci of insur compani __PUNCT__
thei should retir with the digniti and the respect and the care that thei have earn __PUNCT__
so ye __PUNCT__ we will reform and strengthen medicar for the long haul __PUNCT__ that need to be done __PUNCT__
but we go to do it by reduc the cost of health care __PUNCT__ not by just dump the cost on senior and ask them to pai more __PUNCT__ thousand of dollar more __PUNCT__
and while we at it __PUNCT__ we go to keep the promis of social secur by take the respons step to strengthen it __PUNCT__ and that not by turn it over to wall street __PUNCT__
audienc member __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ the presid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ rebuild the economi is essenti __PUNCT__ but everybodi know our prosper at home is link to what we do abroad __PUNCT__
four year ago __PUNCT__ i promis to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ i did __PUNCT__
i said that we would begin to wind down the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__ and we ar __PUNCT__
a new tower rise abov the new york skylin __PUNCT__ meanwhil __PUNCT__ al qaida is on the path to defeat __PUNCT__ and osama bin laden is dead __PUNCT__
so we go to keep move forward __PUNCT__
as long as i command in chief __PUNCT__ we will sustain the strongest militari the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
and when our troop come home and take off their uniform __PUNCT__ like thi veteran right here __PUNCT__ we will serv them as well as thei have serv us __PUNCT__
becaus no on who fight for thi countri should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that thei need when thei come home __PUNCT__
my oppon ha a differ view __PUNCT__
he said the wai i end the war in iraq wa __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__
he won't tell us how he end the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ and i will __PUNCT__
and while he want to spend more monei on militari program that the joint chief don't even want __PUNCT__ sai it won't make us safer __PUNCT__ i go to us some of that monei that we no longer spend on war to pai down our debt and to put more peopl back to work rebuild school and bridg and runwai and road __PUNCT__ becaus after a decad at war __PUNCT__ i think it time to some nation __PUNCT__ build here at home __PUNCT__
so thi is the choic that we face __PUNCT__
thi is what the elect come down to __PUNCT__
over and over __PUNCT__ the other side spent all the time thei had here in florida sai that bigger tax cut and fewer regul ar the onli wai __PUNCT__
thei kept on argu over and over again that sinc govern can't do everyth __PUNCT__ it should do almost noth __PUNCT__
their basic theori is __PUNCT__ if you can't afford health insur __PUNCT__ hope you don't get sick __PUNCT__
if a compani releas toxic pollut into the air that your children breath __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that just the price of progress __PUNCT__
if you can't afford to go to colleg __PUNCT__ take my oppon advic and borrow monei from your parent __PUNCT__
you know what __PUNCT__ that not who we ar __PUNCT__
that not what america is about __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ we believ and insist on person respons __PUNCT__
we believ in individu initi __PUNCT__
we know we not entitl to success __PUNCT__ we got to earn it __PUNCT__
we honor the businessmen and the striver and the dreamer and the risk __PUNCT__ taker who alwai been the drive forc behind our free enterpris system __PUNCT__ the greatest engin of growth and prosper that the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
but you know what __PUNCT__ we also believ that thi countri onli work when we accept certain oblig to on anoth __PUNCT__ to futur gener __PUNCT__
we believ in the idea of citizenship __PUNCT__ the idea that america is not just about what can be done for us __PUNCT__ but what can be done by us __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
that what you believ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
i told you the elect wasn't about me __PUNCT__ it wa about you __PUNCT__
and as i look out on thi crowd __PUNCT__ i am remind __PUNCT__ you were the chang __PUNCT__
folk here in florida from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ nativ american __PUNCT__ young __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__ gai __PUNCT__ straight __PUNCT__ abl __PUNCT__ not __PUNCT__ disabl __PUNCT__ listen __PUNCT__ you the reason that senior across florida ar save an averag of __MONEY__ everi year on prescript drug becaus of obamacar __PUNCT__ becaus of health care reform __PUNCT__
you did that __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ i do care __PUNCT__
so i like the term obamacar __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ romnei sai he go to repeal it __PUNCT__ which mean hi plan is __PUNCT__ romnei __PUNCT__ don't __PUNCT__ care __PUNCT__
you the reason __PUNCT__
you the reason that a woman in doral __PUNCT__ who alreadi work full __PUNCT__ time dure the dai __PUNCT__ can now afford to go to school at night becaus she get the financi aid that she need __PUNCT__

you the reason there a work famili from hollywood who wa abl to save their home from foreclosur __PUNCT__ keep their piec of the american dream __PUNCT__
you made that possibl __PUNCT__
you the reason a young immigr who grew up here and went to school here and pledg allegi to our flag will no longer be deport from the onli countri she ever call home __PUNCT__
you the reason why an outstand soldier won't be kick out of the militari becaus of who thei ar or who thei love __PUNCT__
