mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ i rise todai to urg my colleagu to think about the implic the nuclear option would have on thi chamber and thi countri __PUNCT__
i urg you to think not just about win everi debat __PUNCT__ but about protect free and democrat debat __PUNCT__
dure my senat campaign __PUNCT__ i had the privileg and the opportun to meet american from all walk of life and both end of the polit spectrum __PUNCT__
thei told me about their live __PUNCT__ about their hope __PUNCT__ about the issu that matter to them __PUNCT__ and thei also told me what thei think about washington __PUNCT__
becaus you all heard it yourselv __PUNCT__ i know it won't surpris mani of you to learn that a lot of peopl don't think much get done around here about the issu thei care most about __PUNCT__
thei think the atmospher ha becom too partisan __PUNCT__ the argument have becom too nasti __PUNCT__ and the polit agenda have becom too petti __PUNCT__
and while i haven't been here too long __PUNCT__ i notic that partisan debat is sharp __PUNCT__ and dissent is not alwai well __PUNCT__ receiv __PUNCT__
honest differ of opinion and principl compromis often seem to be the victim of a determin to score point against on oppon __PUNCT__
but the american peopl sent us here to be their voic __PUNCT__
thei understand that those voic can at time becom loud and argument __PUNCT__ but thei also hope that we can disagre without be disagre __PUNCT__
and at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ thei expect both parti to work togeth to get the peopl busi done __PUNCT__
what thei don't expect is for on parti __PUNCT__ be it republican or democrat __PUNCT__ to chang the rule in the middl of the game so that thei can make all the decis while the other parti is told to sit down and keep quiet __PUNCT__
the american peopl want less partisanship in thi town __PUNCT__ but everyon in thi chamber know that if the major choos to end the filibust __PUNCT__ if thei choos to chang the rule and put an end to democrat debat __PUNCT__ then the fight and the bitter and the gridlock will onli get wors __PUNCT__
i understand that republican ar get a lot of pressur to do thi from faction outsid the chamber __PUNCT__
but we need to rise abov an __PUNCT__ end justifi the mean __PUNCT__ mental becaus we here to answer to the peopl __PUNCT__ all of the peopl __PUNCT__ not just the on wear our parti label __PUNCT__
the fact is that both parti have work togeth to confirm __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of thi presid judici nomine __PUNCT__
the senat ha accept __NUM__ of hi __NUM__ select __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we just confirm anoth on judg thi week by a vote of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
overal __PUNCT__ thi is a better record than ani presid had in the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
for a presid who receiv __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the vote and a senat chamber made up of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the presid parti __PUNCT__ i sai that confirm __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of your judici nomin is a record i be pretti happi with __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ i urg my republican colleagu not to go through with chang these rule __PUNCT__
in the long run __PUNCT__ thi is not a good result for either parti __PUNCT__
on dai democrat will be in the major again __PUNCT__ and thi rule chang will be no fairer to a republican minor than it is to a democrat minor __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ i sens that talk of the nuclear option is more about power than about fair __PUNCT__
i believ some of my colleagu propos thi rule chang becaus thei can get awai with it rather than becaus thei know it good for our democraci __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we face with rise ga price __PUNCT__ skyrocket tuition cost __PUNCT__ a record number of uninsur american __PUNCT__ and some of the most seriou nation secur threat we ever had __PUNCT__ all while our bravest young men and women ar risk their live halfwai around the world to keep us safe __PUNCT__
these ar challeng we all want to meet and problem we all want to solv __PUNCT__ even if we don't all agre how to do it __PUNCT__
but if the right of free and open debat is taken awai from the minor parti and the million of american who ask us to be their voic __PUNCT__ i fear that the alreadi partisan atmospher of washington will be poison to the point where no on will be abl to agre on anyth __PUNCT__
that doesn't serv anyon best interest __PUNCT__ and it certainli isn't what the patriot who found thi democraci had in mind __PUNCT__
we ow the peopl who sent us here more than that __PUNCT__
we ow them much more __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
