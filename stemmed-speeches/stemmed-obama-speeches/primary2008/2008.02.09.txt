it ha now been on year sinc we began thi campaign for the presid on the step of the old state capitol in springfield __PUNCT__ illinoi __PUNCT__ just me and __NUM__ of my closest friend __PUNCT__
at the time __PUNCT__ there weren't too mani who imagin we be stand where we ar todai __PUNCT__
i knew i wouldn't be washington favorit candid __PUNCT__
i knew we wouldn't get all the big donor or endors right off the bat __PUNCT__
i knew i be the underdog in everi contest from __DATE__ to __DATE__ __PUNCT__
i knew it wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__
but then someth start happen __PUNCT__
as we met peopl in their live room and on their farm __PUNCT__ in church and town hall meet __PUNCT__ thei all start tell a similar stori about the state of our polit todai __PUNCT__
whether thei young or old __PUNCT__ black or white __PUNCT__ latino or asian __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ independ or even republican __PUNCT__ the messag is the same __PUNCT__
we ar tire of be disappoint by our polit __PUNCT__
we ar tire of be let down __PUNCT__
we tire of hear promis made and ten __PUNCT__ point plan propos in the heat of a campaign onli to have noth chang when everyon goe back to washington __PUNCT__
becaus the lobbyist just write anoth check __PUNCT__
or becaus politician start worri about how thei win the next elect instead of why thei should __PUNCT__
or becaus thei focu on who up and who down instead of who matter __PUNCT__
and while washington is consum with the same drama and divis and distract __PUNCT__ anoth famili put up a for sale sign in the front yard __PUNCT__
anoth factori shut it door forev __PUNCT__
anoth mother declar bankruptci becaus she cannot pai her child medic bill __PUNCT__
and anoth soldier wave goodby as he leav on anoth tour of duti in a war that should never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
it goe on and on and on __PUNCT__ year after year after year __PUNCT__
but in thi elect __PUNCT__ at thi moment __PUNCT__ american ar stand up all across the countri to sai __PUNCT__ not thi time __PUNCT__
not thi year __PUNCT__
the stake ar too high and the challeng too great to plai the same washington game with the same washington player and expect a differ result __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ voter from the west coast to the gulf coast to the heart of america stood up to sai that it is time to turn the page __PUNCT__
we won louisiana __PUNCT__ and nebraska __PUNCT__ and the state of washington __PUNCT__ and i believ that we can win in virginia on tuesdai if you readi to stand for chang __PUNCT__
each of us run for the democrat nomin agre on on thing that the other parti doe not __PUNCT__ the next presid must end the disastr polici of georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
and both senat clinton and i have put forth detail plan and good idea that would do just that __PUNCT__
but i am run for presid becaus i believ that to actual make chang happen __PUNCT__ to make thi time differ than all the rest __PUNCT__ we need a leader who can final move beyond the divis polit of washington and bring democrat __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ and republican togeth to get thing done __PUNCT__
that how we win thi elect __PUNCT__ and that how we chang thi countri when i am presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
thi week we found out that the presumpt nomine of the republican parti is senat john mccain __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ john mccain is a good man __PUNCT__ an american hero __PUNCT__ and we honor hi half centuri of servic to thi nation __PUNCT__
but in thi campaign __PUNCT__ he ha made the decis to embrac the fail polici georg bush washington __PUNCT__
he speak of a hundr year war in iraq and see anoth on the horizon with iran __PUNCT__
he onc oppos georg bush tax cut for the wealthiest few who don't need them and didn't ask for them __PUNCT__
he said thei were too expens and unwis __PUNCT__
and he wa absolut right __PUNCT__
but somewher along the line __PUNCT__ the wheel came off the straight talk express becaus he now he support the veri same tax cut he vote against __PUNCT__
thi is what happen when you spend too long in washington __PUNCT__
politician don't sai what thei mean and thei don't mean what thei sai __PUNCT__
and that is why in thi elect __PUNCT__ our parti cannot stand for busi __PUNCT__ as __PUNCT__ usual in washington __PUNCT__
the democrat parti must stand for chang __PUNCT__
thi fall __PUNCT__ we ow the american peopl a real choic __PUNCT__
it a choic between debat john mccain about who ha the most experi in washington __PUNCT__ or debat him about who most like to chang washington __PUNCT__
becaus that a debat we can win __PUNCT__
it a choic between debat john mccain about lobbi reform with a nomine who taken more monei from lobbyist than he ha __PUNCT__ or do it with a campaign that hasn't taken a dime of their monei becaus we been fund by you __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__
and it a choic between take on john mccain with republican and independ alreadi unit against us __PUNCT__ or run against him with a campaign that unit american of all parti around a common purpos __PUNCT__
there is a reason why the last six poll in a row have shown that i the strongest candid against john mccain __PUNCT__
it becaus we done better with independ in almost everi singl contest we had __PUNCT__
it becaus we won in more red state and swing state that the next democrat nomine need to win in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
virginia democrat know how import thi is __PUNCT__
that how mark warner won in thi state __PUNCT__
that how tim kain won in thi state __PUNCT__
that how jim webb won in thi state __PUNCT__
and if i am your nomine __PUNCT__ thi is on democrat who plan to campaign in virginia and win in virginia thi fall __PUNCT__
we ar here to make clear that thi elect is not between region or religion or gender __PUNCT__
it not about rich versu poor __PUNCT__ young versu old __PUNCT__ and it is not about black versu white __PUNCT__
it is about the past versu the futur __PUNCT__
the republican in washington ar alreadi run on the polit of yesterdai __PUNCT__ which is why our parti must be the parti of tomorrow __PUNCT__
and that is the parti i will lead as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i know what it take to pass health care reform becaus i done it __PUNCT__ not by demon anyon who disagre with me __PUNCT__ but by bring democrat and republican togeth to provid health insur to __NUM__ children and parent in illinoi __PUNCT__
and when i am presid __PUNCT__ we pass univers health care not in twenti year __PUNCT__ not in ten year __PUNCT__ but by the end of my first term in offic __PUNCT__
but you don't have to take my word for it __PUNCT__
senat ted kennedi recent said that he wouldn't have endors me if he didn't believ passion that i will fight for univers health care as presid __PUNCT__
and if there someon who know someth about health care __PUNCT__ it ted kennedi __PUNCT__
my plan would bring down premium for the typic famili by __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
we ban insur compani from deni you coverag becaus of a pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
we allow everi american to get the same kind of health care that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
and the on differ between my plan and senat clinton plan is that she said she __PUNCT__ go after __PUNCT__ your wage if you don't bui health care __PUNCT__
well i believ the reason peopl don't have health care isn't becaus no on forc them to bui it __PUNCT__ it becaus no on made it afford __PUNCT__ and that why we bring down the cost of health care more than ani other plan in thi race __PUNCT__
it also time to bring the cost of live down for work famili who ar struggl in thi economi like never befor __PUNCT__
thei face rise cost and fall wage __PUNCT__ and we ow it to them to end the bush __PUNCT__ mccain tax cut for the wealthiest __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and put a tax cut into the pocket of the famili who need it __PUNCT__
that what i did in illinoi when i brought democrat and republican togeth to provid __MONEY__ million in tax relief to work famili and the work poor __PUNCT__ and that the kind of tax relief i provid as presid __PUNCT__
i will end the tax break for compani who ship our job oversea and give a middl __PUNCT__ class tax break to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of work american __PUNCT__
and homeown who ar struggl __PUNCT__
and senior who deserv to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
and i won't wait anoth ten year to rais the minimum wage in thi countri __PUNCT__ i will rais it to keep pace with inflat everi singl year __PUNCT__
it also time to give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ from the dai thei born to the dai thei graduat colleg __PUNCT__
i am onli here todai becaus somebodi __PUNCT__ somewher __PUNCT__ gave my father a ticket to come studi in america __PUNCT__
becaus my mother got the opportun to put herself through graduat school __PUNCT__
becaus even though we didn't have much grow up __PUNCT__ i got scholarship to go to some of the best school in the countri __PUNCT__
that the chanc i believ everi child should have __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will give our children the best possibl start by invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
we stop talk about how great our teacher ar __PUNCT__ and start reward them for their great __PUNCT__ with better pai and more support __PUNCT__
and we will provid everi american with a __MONEY__ a year tax credit that will final help make a colleg educ afford and avail for all __PUNCT__
and when i am presid __PUNCT__ thi parti will be the parti that final make sure our son and daughter don't grow up in a centuri where our economi is weigh down by our addict to oil __PUNCT__ our foreign polici is held hostag to the whim of dictat __PUNCT__ and our planet pass a moment of no return __PUNCT__
when i call for higher fuel effici standard __PUNCT__ i didn't do it in front of an environment group in california __PUNCT__ i did it in front of the automak in detroit __PUNCT__
now it wa pretti quiet __PUNCT__ i didn't get a lot of applaus __PUNCT__
but we need leadership that tell the american peopl not just what thei want to hear __PUNCT__ but what we need to know __PUNCT__
that why i will set the goal of an __NUM__ __PUNCT__ reduct in carbon emiss by __NUM__ and we will meet it __PUNCT__ with higher fuel standard and new invest in renew fuel that will creat million of new job and entir new industri right here in america __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ it is time to turn the page on eight year of a foreign polici that ha made us less safe and less respect in the world __PUNCT__
if i am the nomine of thi parti __PUNCT__ john mccain will not be abl to sai that i agre with him on vote for the war in iraq __PUNCT__ agre with him on give georg bush the benefit of the doubt on iran __PUNCT__ and agre with him in embrac the bush __PUNCT__ chenei polici of not talk to leader we don't like __PUNCT__
becaus that doesn't make us look strong __PUNCT__ it make us look arrog __PUNCT__
john f __PUNCT__ kennedi said that you should never negoti out of fear __PUNCT__ but you should never fear to negoti __PUNCT__
and that what i will do as presid __PUNCT__
i don't just want to end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ i want to end the mindset that got us into war __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page __PUNCT__
thi is our moment __PUNCT__
thi is our time for chang __PUNCT__
our parti __PUNCT__ the democrat parti __PUNCT__ ha alwai been at it best when we led not by poll __PUNCT__ but by principl __PUNCT__ not by calcul __PUNCT__ but by convict __PUNCT__ when we call all american to a common purpos __PUNCT__ a higher purpos __PUNCT__
we ar the parti of jefferson __PUNCT__ who wrote the word that we ar still try to heed __PUNCT__ that all of us ar creat equal __PUNCT__ that all of us deserv the chanc to pursu our happi __PUNCT__
we the parti of jackson __PUNCT__ who took back the white hous for the peopl of thi countri __PUNCT__
we the parti of a man who overcam hi own disabl to tell us that the onli thing we had to fear wa fear itself __PUNCT__ who face down fascism and liber a contin from tyranni __PUNCT__
and we the parti of a young presid who ask what we could do for our countri __PUNCT__ and the challeng us to do it __PUNCT__
that is who we ar __PUNCT__
that is the parti that we need to be __PUNCT__ and can be __PUNCT__ if we cast off our doubt __PUNCT__ and leav behind our fear __PUNCT__ and choos the america that we know is possibl __PUNCT__
becaus there is a moment in the life of everi gener __PUNCT__ if it is to make it mark on histori __PUNCT__ when it spirit ha to come through __PUNCT__ when it must choos the futur over the past __PUNCT__ when it must make it own chang from the bottom up __PUNCT__
thi is our moment __PUNCT__
thi is our messag __PUNCT__ the same messag we had when we were up __PUNCT__ and when we were down __PUNCT__
the same messag that we will carri all the wai to the convent __PUNCT__
and in seven month time we can realiz thi promis __PUNCT__ we can claim thi legaci __PUNCT__ we can choos new leadership for america __PUNCT__
becaus there is noth we cannot do if the american peopl decid it is time __PUNCT__
