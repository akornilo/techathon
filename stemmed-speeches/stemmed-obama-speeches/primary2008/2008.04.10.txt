befor we get start todai __PUNCT__ i just want to sai a few word about the troubl econom situat we got in thi countri __PUNCT__
thi is the number on issu on lot of peopl mind these dai __PUNCT__
and we all know why __PUNCT__ becaus the cost of everyth from health care __PUNCT__ to a tank of ga __PUNCT__ to colleg tuition ha gone up while wage have stai the same __PUNCT__
million of american ar face foreclosur __PUNCT__ and million more ar unemploi __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ we also know that time haven't been too tough for everyon in our economi __PUNCT__ becaus the top wall street ceo have been do just fine __PUNCT__
in thi morn usa todai __PUNCT__ there wa a stori about how much the top ceo have been make __PUNCT__
thei did a studi and found that the top __NUM__ ceo made somewher around __MONEY__ million last year __PUNCT__ despit the fact that mani of their compani were have a bad year __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter whether thei do a good job or not __PUNCT__ wall street execut ar be reward either wai __PUNCT__
that not the america we believ in __PUNCT__
that an outrag __PUNCT__
but it not an accid __PUNCT__
it a consequ of a tire and cynic philosophi that ha fail the american peopl __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai unless you a big campaign donor or a special interest lobbyist __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
and it a philosophi that come to domin washington over the last seven and a half year __PUNCT__
under georg bush __PUNCT__ we seen tax cut for the wealthiest american who don't need them and didn't ask for them __PUNCT__
we been give tax break to compani that ship job oversea when we should be give them to compani that creat good job here at home __PUNCT__
we been extend a hand to wall street __PUNCT__ but not lift a finger for main street __PUNCT__
and we wonder why poll show folk ar more downbeat about their futur than thei been in nearli fifti year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i respect john mccain __PUNCT__
he be a worthi oppon __PUNCT__
but he been a staunch support of washington fail polici __PUNCT__ and in thi elect he will offer more of the same polici that have set back work peopl __PUNCT__
i admir senat mccain when he stood up and said that the bush tax cut for the wealthiest american offend hi __PUNCT__ conscienc __PUNCT__
but he got over that __PUNCT__ and now he all for them __PUNCT__ and for continu to do the same thing that have taken us toward recess __PUNCT__
just look at the speech he give todai about our economi __PUNCT__
senat mccain is make some propos about how to deal with our hous crisi __PUNCT__
and i glad he final decid to offer a plan __PUNCT__
better late than never __PUNCT__
but don't expect ani real answer __PUNCT__
don't expect it to actual help struggl famili __PUNCT__
becaus senat mccain solut to the hous crisi seem a lot like the georg bush solut of sit by and hope it pass while famili face foreclosur and watch the valu of their home erod __PUNCT__
the american peopl can't afford thi kind of do __PUNCT__ noth approach __PUNCT__
thei need help immedi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ congress took some step sever week ago to stimul our economi __PUNCT__ and mani of these step were on i wa call for back in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
but our economi keep get wors __PUNCT__
just last week __PUNCT__ we learn that we lost __NUM__ job thi year __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ job were lost in march alon __PUNCT__
that why i call for a second stimulu packag to help hardwork famili and strengthen our middl class __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to get immedi relief to the unemploi who need help most __PUNCT__
if you lost your job dure thi current econom downturn __PUNCT__ you nearli twice as like to stai unemploi for six month or longer as you were at the start of the last recess in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
it especi hard to find a job for older worker who don't have the skill to compet in our __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
so we need to significantli extend unemploy insur and expand it to includ folk who ar current left out __PUNCT__
that wai __PUNCT__ we can help them make end meet while thei out of work __PUNCT__ and make sure thei still spend monei so we can keep the wheel of our economi turn __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we need to address the crisi in the hous market __PUNCT__ becaus we know that the hous crisi is the sourc of mani of the other econom problem we face todai __PUNCT__
that why i call for the immedi creation of a __MONEY__ billion foreclosur prevent fund __PUNCT__
thi fund would help struggl homeown sell a home that beyond their mean __PUNCT__ or get emerg pre __PUNCT__ foreclosur counsel so thei can make inform decis __PUNCT__ or modifi their loan to avoid foreclosur or bankruptci __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i also propos __MONEY__ billion in relief for state and local govern in those area that ar be hardest hit by our hous crisi and struggl economi __PUNCT__ becaus we need to make sure that thei have enough monei to provid critic servic like health care and hous __PUNCT__ and don't have to cut back on provid help for our famili in these difficult time __PUNCT__
but understand __PUNCT__ if we seriou about strengthen our economi __PUNCT__ we got to invest in long __PUNCT__ term job growth as well __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ back in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ american were put to work build the interst highwai system and that help expand the middl class in thi countri __PUNCT__
we need to show the same kind of leadership todai __PUNCT__
that why i call for a nation infrastructur reinvest bank that will invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year and gener nearli two million new job __PUNCT__ mani of them in the construct industri that suffer dure thi hous crisi __PUNCT__
and i also propos invest __MONEY__ billion in our green energi sector over the next ten year __PUNCT__
thi won't just help reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ and it won't just help save thi planet for our children __PUNCT__
it will also creat up to five million new job __PUNCT__ and those ar job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
thi is the kind of help american need __PUNCT__
and thi is the kind of help washington ha to provid __PUNCT__
it time to end the bush __PUNCT__ mccain approach that tell the american peopl __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__ becaus we know we all in thi togeth as american __PUNCT__
that what brought you here todai __PUNCT__
and that the idea we restor in the white hous when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
