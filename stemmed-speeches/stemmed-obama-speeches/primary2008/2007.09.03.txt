i have been run for presid now for a littl more than six month __PUNCT__
and everywher we gone we seen these huge crowd just like thi on __PUNCT__
we saw __NUM__ in iowa citi __PUNCT__
__NUM__ in austin __PUNCT__
__NUM__ in atlanta __PUNCT__
it not just the number themselv that ar so inspir __PUNCT__
it the peopl behind those number __PUNCT__
thei young and old __PUNCT__ black and white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ and nativ american __PUNCT__
thei democrat and independ and more than a few republican __PUNCT__
mani ar show up to the veri first polit event of their lifetim __PUNCT__
the convent think in washington tell us that we a countri divid into red state and blue state __PUNCT__ that we doom to fight the same tire partisan battl over and over again __PUNCT__
thei tell us we can't come togeth to take on big challeng like health care __PUNCT__ or energi __PUNCT__ or educ __PUNCT__ that we can't agre on what america should be __PUNCT__ so we might as well settl for the wai america is right now __PUNCT__
but these crowd tell me someth els __PUNCT__
thei tell me that when it come to what wrong with thi countri __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar not the problem __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar the answer __PUNCT__
we here todai __PUNCT__ you and i __PUNCT__ becaus we believ in what thi countri can be __PUNCT__
in the face of war __PUNCT__ we believ there can be peac __PUNCT__
in the face of despair __PUNCT__ we believ there can be hope __PUNCT__
in the face of a polit that shut us out __PUNCT__ that told us to settl __PUNCT__ that divid us for too long __PUNCT__ we believ we can be on peopl __PUNCT__ reach for what possibl __PUNCT__ build that more perfect union __PUNCT__
that why we here __PUNCT__
we know we need a new direct __PUNCT__
and that chang begin with an end to the bush __PUNCT__ chenei administr __PUNCT__
their year haven't just been bad year for democrat __PUNCT__
thei been bad year for america __PUNCT__
we seen the triumph of ideolog over reason __PUNCT__ of cronyism over compet __PUNCT__
we seen the constitut of the unit state treat as a nuisanc instead of the found document of our democraci __PUNCT__
we seen polici that have widen the divid between wall street and main street and margin organ labor at a time when american worker need a voic most __PUNCT__
we seen fellow citizen abandon on rooftop after a storm __PUNCT__
and we seen a disastr war in iraq that should never have been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
but we also know that __PUNCT__ as bad as georg bush ha been __PUNCT__ it go to take more than a chang of parti in the white hous to truli turn thi countri around __PUNCT__
georg bush and dick chenei mai have turn divis __PUNCT__ special __PUNCT__ interest polit into an art form __PUNCT__ but thei didn't invent it __PUNCT__
it wa there befor thei got to washington __PUNCT__ and if you and i don't stand up and challeng it __PUNCT__ it will be there long after thei leav __PUNCT__
and so we face a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
do we continu the cynic math that sai it a win strategi to divid our countri in two __PUNCT__ and simpli ignor the half that doesn't agre __PUNCT__ or do we find our stake in each other as american __PUNCT__ unit again by a sens of common purpos and a common destini __PUNCT__
do we continu the convent washington think on foreign polici that led us to thi tragic war in iraq __PUNCT__ or do we recogn the challeng of a new world __PUNCT__ and engag with friend and foe in a wai that restor america moral leadership and secur __PUNCT__
do we continu to allow lobbyist to veto our progress __PUNCT__ or do we final put our nation interest ahead of the special interest __PUNCT__ and address the concern peopl feel over their job __PUNCT__ their health care and their children futur __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
becaus to meet america challeng __PUNCT__ chang parti isn't chang enough __PUNCT__
we need someth new __PUNCT__
we need to turn the page __PUNCT__
there ar those who tout their experi work the system in washington __PUNCT__ but the problem is that the system in washington isn't work for us and hasn't for a long time __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__
we been talk about the health care crisi in thi countri for decad __PUNCT__
yet through democrat and republican administr we fail to act __PUNCT__
and you know why __PUNCT__ becaus the drug and insur industri ha spent over a billion dollar on lobbi in the past ten year alon to block reform __PUNCT__
we heard promis of energi independ for decad __PUNCT__ yet everi year __PUNCT__ the oil and ga lobbyist us their clout and their monei to keep us addict to fossil fuel __PUNCT__
too mani in washington see polit as a game __PUNCT__
and that is why i believ thi elect cannot be about who can plai thi game better __PUNCT__
it ha to be about who can put an end to the game __PUNCT__ plai __PUNCT__
the time ar too seriou __PUNCT__ the stake ar too high __PUNCT__
and the chang that requir __PUNCT__ thi new spirit of respons and honesti __PUNCT__ of serious and sacrific __PUNCT__ start with you __PUNCT__
it start with million of peopl across thi countri __PUNCT__ come togeth to demand someth better __PUNCT__
i have never seen polit as a game __PUNCT__
from the dai i decid to becom a commun organ on the south side of chicago over two decad ago __PUNCT__ i have alwai seen polit as a mission __PUNCT__ as the wai we hold thi countri up to our highest ideal __PUNCT__
and when we fallen short of those ideal __PUNCT__ it thi sens of mission that ha compel american of all background and belief to put asid their differ and push their shoulder against the wheel of histori in search of a better dai __PUNCT__
it thi sens of mission that led my grandfath to enlist after pearl harbor and sent my grandmoth to a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
it what led thousand of young peopl i never know to sit at lunch counter and brave fire hose so that we all might be free __PUNCT__
it what led my father to keep write letter until someon answer hi prayer and gave him hi ticket to america __PUNCT__
and it what led me to those poor neighborhood in chicago __PUNCT__ so that i could do my part to help folk who had lost job and lost hope when the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
it polit as a mission __PUNCT__
and if you don't spend your whole life in washington __PUNCT__ it becom easier to rememb what thi mean __PUNCT__
the other dai i got head to out to california becaus the servic employe __PUNCT__ union had organ an event where i would walk in the shoe of on of their member for a dai __PUNCT__
and so i woke up at five a.m __PUNCT__ and met up with thi sixti __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old woman name paulin beck who wa a home care worker __PUNCT__
everi dai of her life she wake up and she take care of two foster children who do not have a famili of their own __PUNCT__
then she goe to work and she take care of an eighti __PUNCT__ seven __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old ampute __PUNCT__
and so i went with her to work __PUNCT__ and we scrub the floor and we did the laundri and clean the room __PUNCT__
it wa on of the best dai i had on the campaign so far __PUNCT__
becaus it remind me of what we do here __PUNCT__
listen to thi humbl woman talk about the hardship of her life without a trace of self __PUNCT__ piti __PUNCT__ glad she could be of some servic to somebodi __PUNCT__ just want a littl bit more pai to take care of those kid __PUNCT__ a littl more secur for her retir __PUNCT__ mayb a dai off onc in awhil to rest her tire back __PUNCT__ i wa remind that for all the nois and the petti come out of washington __PUNCT__ what hold thi countri togeth is thi fundament belief that we all have a stake in each other __PUNCT__ that i am my brother keeper __PUNCT__ that i am my sister keeper __PUNCT__
and that must express itself not onli in our church and synagogu or in our person live __PUNCT__ but in our govern too __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when the folk in washington hear me speak __PUNCT__ thi is usual when thei start roll their ey __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ there he goe talk about hope again __PUNCT__
he so naiv __PUNCT__
he a hope peddler __PUNCT__
he a hope __PUNCT__ monger __PUNCT__
well i stand guilti as charg __PUNCT__
i am hope about america __PUNCT__
appar the pundit consid thi a chronic condit __PUNCT__ a symptom of a lack of experi __PUNCT__
i us to wonder what thei meant __PUNCT__ thi whole experi argument __PUNCT__ becaus i been fight for peopl as a public servant for over two decad __PUNCT__ as a commun organ __PUNCT__ a civil right lawyer __PUNCT__ a constitut law professor __PUNCT__ a state senat __PUNCT__ and a u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
but then i came to realiz that to thi bunch __PUNCT__ onli the year you spend in washington count __PUNCT__
onli time in washington translat into wisdom __PUNCT__
i think thei ar wrong about that __PUNCT__
recent histori suggest otherwis __PUNCT__
there were a coupl of gui name chenei and rumsfeld who had two of the longest resum in washington and thei led us into the worst foreign polici fiasco in our histori __PUNCT__
time serv doesn't guarante judgment __PUNCT__
a resum doe noth about charact __PUNCT__
so let me tell you about a differ kind of experi __PUNCT__ the experi i bring to thi race __PUNCT__
my experi tell me that real chang and progress come not by divid __PUNCT__ but by bring peopl togeth to get thing done __PUNCT__ like when i work with polic offic and civil right advoc to reform a death penalti system that had sent thirteen innoc peopl in illinoi to death row __PUNCT__
or when i work with republican and democrat to expand health care for __NUM__ illinoisan __PUNCT__ or put __MONEY__ million worth of tax cut in the pocket of work famili __PUNCT__
or when i work with my republican colleagu __PUNCT__ dick lugar __PUNCT__ to pass a law secur danger weapon in the old soviet union __PUNCT__
my experi tell me that real chang and reform come when we will to put the peopl interest befor the special interest and partisan interest __PUNCT__
that what i did in illinoi when i took on monei in polit and pass the first ethic reform in twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__ and that what i did in washington when i pass a law that earn me the cold shoulder from leader of both parti __PUNCT__ for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ washington lobbyist will have to disclos who thei rais monei from and who in congress thei funnel it to __PUNCT__
my experi tell me that real chang and secur come when we will to make foreign polici decis base not on what popular in washington __PUNCT__ but what right for america __PUNCT__ base on a real understand of the world __PUNCT__
that why i resist the tide in my campaign for the us senat and oppos the war in iraq from the start __PUNCT__
as we saw then __PUNCT__ longev in washington is no guarante of good judgment __PUNCT__
so let be clear __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of peopl who have been in washington longer than me __PUNCT__ who have better connect and go to the right dinner parti and know how to talk the washington talk __PUNCT__
well i might not have the experi washington like __PUNCT__ but i believ i have the experi america need right now __PUNCT__
hope and chang ar not just the rhetor of a campaign for me __PUNCT__
hope and chang have been the caus of my life __PUNCT__
hope and chang ar the stori of our countri __PUNCT__
and we here todai to continu that stori __PUNCT__
we here to infus the old washington polit with a new sens of mission __PUNCT__ to unit peopl around a common purpos __PUNCT__
to ralli american around a common destini __PUNCT__
we aren't just here to win an elect __PUNCT__
we ar here to transform a nation __PUNCT__
i do not accept that in the richest nation on earth we have to stand by while __NUM__ million american have no health care and million more ar on the verg of bankruptci becaus of their medic bill __PUNCT__
my mother di of ovarian cancer in the prime of her life and do you know what she wa most worri about in those final month __PUNCT__ she wa between job when she wa diagnos and she wasn't sure whether insur would cover her treatment __PUNCT__
so i know what it like to see a love on suffer becaus of a broken health care system __PUNCT__
i know that it wrong __PUNCT__
and i know that not who we ar __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will have univers health care in thi countri by the end of my first term in offic __PUNCT__
it a plan that will cover everi american and cut the cost of a typic famili premium by __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and i will not let the drug and insur compani spend anoth billion dollar to block reform __PUNCT__ becaus peopl like my mother shouldn't have to worri about bankruptci everi time thei get sick __PUNCT__
we better than that __PUNCT__
i do not accept that we have to keep send __MONEY__ million a dai to hostil nation becaus of our addict to foreign oil __PUNCT__ a depend that fuel both side of the war on terror and is melt the polar ic cap in the bargain __PUNCT__
we can meet our moral oblig to futur gener and halt the march of global warm __PUNCT__
i have a plan to rais our fuel standard that won the support of some lawmak who had never support rais fuel standard befor __PUNCT__
and i didn't just give a speech about it in front of some environment audienc in california __PUNCT__ i went right to detroit and said it in front of a group of automak __PUNCT__
now i have to admit __PUNCT__ the room wa pretti quiet __PUNCT__
but i did it becaus i don't think we go to get anywher in thi countri by just tell everyon what thei want to hear __PUNCT__
we have to tell peopl what thei need to hear __PUNCT__
we have to tell peopl the truth __PUNCT__
and you shouldn't expect anyth less from your presid __PUNCT__
i don't accept that we can't give everi singl child in america a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
we know countri that out __PUNCT__ teach us todai will out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
but it bigger than that __PUNCT__
the america we believ in isn't a countri where million of children ar rob of their opportun by fail school __PUNCT__
and the answer isn't just a snappi slogan __PUNCT__
to truli leav no child behind __PUNCT__ we have to make a genuin commit to educ opportun for all __PUNCT__ from cradl to adulthood __PUNCT__
thi countri should be focus on the most import part of ani child achiev __PUNCT__ the person stand at the front of the classroom __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a campaign to recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and we pai them better __PUNCT__ and give them more support __PUNCT__ and help them reach high standard by work with them __PUNCT__ not work against them __PUNCT__
i will invest in earli childhood educ so that everi child ha the best possibl start in life __PUNCT__
and while we at it __PUNCT__ let final make a colleg degre afford and avail to everi american __PUNCT__ and bolster our commun colleg to help educ and train america worker __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__
i do not accept that the american dream is a thing of the past __PUNCT__
on thi labor dai __PUNCT__ let give american worker more than a parad __PUNCT__
let give them polici that actual valu their work __PUNCT__
let provid them with a live wage __PUNCT__
let allow our union do what thei do best again __PUNCT__ organ our worker and lift up our middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__
and let stop give tax break to the compani who send them oversea and start give them to compani who creat job right here in america __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i do not accept an america that ha lost it moral stand in the commun of nation __PUNCT__
todai there is no greater mission than keep america safe and restor america imag in the world __PUNCT__
that start with end thi war __PUNCT__
i oppos the war in iraq from the start __PUNCT__
i said then that iraq wa the wrong battlefield __PUNCT__ that we would find ourselv mire in a lengthi civil war __PUNCT__ divert our attent from al qaeda in afghanistan __PUNCT__
and i introduc a plan back in __DATE__ that would have gradual and respons remov all combat troop from iraq by __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the presid veto a plan just like thi last spring __PUNCT__ but we will be debat the war again next week __PUNCT__
now is the time to keep the pressur on all those republican senat and congressmen who continu to support the presid fail cours __PUNCT__
we can end thi war without georg bush __PUNCT__
and if we don't __PUNCT__ then it will be the first thing i do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
but the chang that is need extend beyond end the war __PUNCT__
to repair the damag __PUNCT__ to meet the danger and seiz the opportun of thi new centuri __PUNCT__ the old formula will not do __PUNCT__
we need to turn the page on the bush __PUNCT__ chenei polici of not talk to leader we don't like __PUNCT__
that doesn't make us look tough __PUNCT__
it make us look arrog __PUNCT__
i not afraid that i lose a propaganda battl with a bunch of dictat __PUNCT__
strong countri and strong presid shouldn't be afraid to talk to our adversari to tell them where america stand __PUNCT__
that why i will __PUNCT__ becaus that how tough __PUNCT__ principl and smart diplomaci work __PUNCT__
i want to go befor the unit nation as presid and sai __PUNCT__ america back __PUNCT__
it time for america to lead again __PUNCT__
it time to fight on the right battlefield in root out al qaeda __PUNCT__
it time to lead by build school in the middl east that teach math and scienc instead of hatr __PUNCT__
it time for us to close guantanamo and restor the right of habea corpu __PUNCT__
it time to show the world that we ar not a countri that ship prison in the dead of night to be tortur in far off countri __PUNCT__
that we ar not a countri that look awai while innoc ar slaughter in darfur __PUNCT__
that we ar not a countri that run prison which lock peopl awai without ever tell them why thei ar there or what thei ar charg with __PUNCT__
that is not who we ar __PUNCT__
we ar the last __PUNCT__ best hope of earth __PUNCT__
we ar the nation that liber a contin from a madman __PUNCT__ that lift ourselv from the depth of depress __PUNCT__ that won civil right __PUNCT__ and women right __PUNCT__ and vote right for all our peopl __PUNCT__
we ar the beacon that ha led gener of weari travel to find opportun __PUNCT__ and liberti __PUNCT__ and hope on our doorstep __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
and that who we can be again __PUNCT__
i am remind everi singl dai that i am not a perfect man __PUNCT__
i will not be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but i can promis you thi __PUNCT__ i will alwai tell you what i think and where i stand __PUNCT__
i will be honest with you about the challeng we face __PUNCT__
i will listen to you when we disagre __PUNCT__
and most importantli __PUNCT__ i will open the door of govern and ask you to be involv in your own democraci again __PUNCT__
i know what i ask is hard __PUNCT__
i know that polit and politician have disappoint you so mani time befor __PUNCT__ to the point where sometim it seem easier to just tune out and walk awai __PUNCT__
but what you have to rememb is that when you walk awai __PUNCT__ the same old polit win everi time __PUNCT__
that what all the peopl who benefit from polit as a game ar count on __PUNCT__
that why we need you __PUNCT__
that why i can't do thi alon __PUNCT__
i am not just ask you to trust in my abil to chang thi countri __PUNCT__ i ask you to trust in yourself __PUNCT__
in your own instinct __PUNCT__
in your own sens of possibl __PUNCT__
in your own sens of what right __PUNCT__
i ask you to bet on us __PUNCT__ on our capac to do what previou gener have done __PUNCT__ to lift our sight __PUNCT__ to join togeth and forg a better futur for our children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
make thi campaign the vehicl for your hope and your dream __PUNCT__ for your sens of what america is and what america can be __PUNCT__
and if you will to work for it and fight for it and bring other to thi caus __PUNCT__ if after thi ralli you decid to go sign up twenti more peopl or volunt to knock on door or serv as a precinct captain __PUNCT__ then i believ that thi time will final be differ from all the rest __PUNCT__
and so i ask you __PUNCT__ if you believ it time to challeng the washington polit that have let us down and shut us out and made us settl __PUNCT__ if you believ it time to restor a sens of mission to our polit and a sens of possibl to america __PUNCT__ if you want a countri that no longer see itself as a collect of red state and blue state __PUNCT__ if you want a presid who can lead a unit state of america __PUNCT__ then i ask you to believ in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i ask you to believ in yourself __PUNCT__ i ask you to believ again in the dream that we call america __PUNCT__
