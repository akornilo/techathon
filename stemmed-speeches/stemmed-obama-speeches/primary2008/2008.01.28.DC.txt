few leader in thi countri have more experi in how to bring about real chang __PUNCT__
and few have better judgment about where we head as a parti and a peopl __PUNCT__
todai isn't just about polit for me __PUNCT__
it person __PUNCT__
i wa too young to rememb john kennedi and i wa just a child when robert kennedi ran for presid __PUNCT__
but in the stori i heard grow up __PUNCT__ i saw how my grandpar and mother spoke about them __PUNCT__ and about that period in our nation life __PUNCT__ as a time of great hope and achiev __PUNCT__
and i think my own sens of what possibl in thi countri come in part from what thei said america wa like in the dai of john and robert kennedi __PUNCT__
i believ that true for million of american __PUNCT__
i seen it in offic in thi citi where portrait of john and robert hang on offic wall or collect of their speech sit on bookshelv __PUNCT__
and i seen it in my travel all across thi countri __PUNCT__
becaus no matter where i go __PUNCT__ or who i talk to __PUNCT__ on thing i can sai for certain is that the dream ha never di __PUNCT__
the dream live on in the older folk i meet who rememb what america onc wa __PUNCT__ and know what america can be onc again __PUNCT__
it live on in the young peopl who onli seen john or robert kennedi on tv __PUNCT__ but ar readi to answer their call __PUNCT__
it live on in those american who refus to be deter by the scale of the challeng we face __PUNCT__ who know __PUNCT__ as presid kennedi said at thi univers __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ no problem of human destini is beyond human be __PUNCT__
and it live on in those american __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ black and white __PUNCT__ latino and asian __PUNCT__ who ar tire of a polit that divid us and want to recaptur the sens of common purpos that we had when john kennedi wa presid __PUNCT__
that is the dream we hold in our heart __PUNCT__
that is the kind of leadership we need in thi countri __PUNCT__
and that is the kind of leadership i intend to offer as presid __PUNCT__
so make no mistak __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect is not between region or religion or gender __PUNCT__
it not about rich versu poor __PUNCT__ young versu old __PUNCT__ and it is not about black versu white __PUNCT__
it about the past versu the futur __PUNCT__
it about whether we go to seiz thi moment to write the next great american stori __PUNCT__
so somedai we can tell our children that thi wa the time when we heal our nation __PUNCT__
thi wa the time when we repair our world __PUNCT__
and thi wa the time when we renew the america that ha led gener of weari travel from all over the world to find opportun __PUNCT__ and liberti __PUNCT__ and hope on our doorstep __PUNCT__
on of these travel wa my father __PUNCT__
i bare knew him __PUNCT__ but when __PUNCT__ after hi death __PUNCT__ i final took my first trip to hi tini villag in kenya and ask my grandmoth if there wa anyth left from him __PUNCT__ she open a trunk and took out a stack of letter __PUNCT__ which she hand to me __PUNCT__
there were more than thirti of them __PUNCT__ all handwritten by my father __PUNCT__ all address to colleg and univers across america __PUNCT__ all fill with the hope of a young man who dream of more for hi life __PUNCT__
and hi prayer wa answer when he wa brought over to studi in thi countri __PUNCT__
but what i learn much later is that part of what made it possibl for him to come here wa an effort by the young senat from massachusett at the time __PUNCT__ john f __PUNCT__ kennedi __PUNCT__ and by a grant from the kennedi foundat to help kenyan student pai for travel __PUNCT__
so it is partli becaus of their generos that my father came to thi countri __PUNCT__ and becaus he did __PUNCT__ i stand befor you todai __PUNCT__ inspir by america past __PUNCT__ fill with hope for america futur __PUNCT__ and determin to do my part in write our next great chapter __PUNCT__
so i ask for your hand __PUNCT__
