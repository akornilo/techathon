mayb you tire of watch our planet pollut and our climat chang forev becaus you know that you and your children will be the on deal with it __PUNCT__
mayb you travel abroad and heard peopl belittl america __PUNCT__ and mayb you felt angri becaus you know we a better countri than thi __PUNCT__ you know we not a countri that tortur peopl or lock them awai without ever tell them why __PUNCT__
you know we not a countri that alien our alli and reject diplomaci with our enemi __PUNCT__
we better than that __PUNCT__
or mayb you here becaus you had to sai goodby to a friend or a classmat when thei left to fight thi war in iraq __PUNCT__
you know how brave thei ar __PUNCT__ and you know thei done everyth that been ask of them __PUNCT__ but you also know on other thing __PUNCT__ you know that thi is a war that should never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__ and it time for that friend to come home __PUNCT__
but no matter what the reason is that brought you here __PUNCT__ you came becaus you believ that we can chang all thi __PUNCT__
you believ what wa said about thi countri in the earliest dai of our revolut __PUNCT__ that we have it within our power to begin the world anew __PUNCT__
i want you to know that why i here too __PUNCT__
that what i have believ all my life __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i know it not an easi proposit to believ __PUNCT__
especi todai __PUNCT__
not when our polit is more concern with who up and who down than who work to solv the challeng face our gener __PUNCT__
not when our politician allow the oil compani to control our energi polici __PUNCT__ and the insur compani to control our health care polici __PUNCT__ and whoever got the most monei and influenc to control the agenda in washington __PUNCT__
and not when we got a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ hour new cycl that never fail to keep us post on how mani dai pari hilton will spend in jail but doesn't alwai cover the continu genocid in darfur or the recoveri effort in new orlean or the poverti that plagu too mani american street __PUNCT__
you see all thi and it easi to becom cynic __PUNCT__ to believ these same pundit when thei sai that the youth vote doesn't realli matter __PUNCT__ that colleg student don't regist to vote and when thei do __PUNCT__ thei never go to the poll anywai __PUNCT__
and so it easi to just stai home and give in to the proposit that on person realli can't make a differ after all __PUNCT__
don't believ it __PUNCT__
if there on thing i learn in my own life __PUNCT__ it that when you stop listen to the cynic and start try to make that differ __PUNCT__ extraordinari thing can happen __PUNCT__
a few year after i graduat from colleg i had thi crazi idea that i want to be a commun organ __PUNCT__
my friend had all appli for job on wall street and my mother and grandpar thought i should go to law school __PUNCT__
but i went ahead and wrote letter to everi organ in the countri that i could think of __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ thi small group of church on the south side of chicago wrote back and gave me a job for __MONEY__ a year help to turn around neighborhood that had been devast by steel __PUNCT__ plant close __PUNCT__
and i can still rememb the convers i had with an older man i had met befor i move to chicago __PUNCT__
i told him about my plan __PUNCT__ and he look at me and said __PUNCT__ let me tell someth __PUNCT__
you look like a nice clean __PUNCT__ cut young man __PUNCT__ and you got a nice voic __PUNCT__
so let me give you a piec of advic __PUNCT__ forget thi commun organ busi __PUNCT__
you can't chang the world __PUNCT__ and peopl won't appreci you try __PUNCT__
what you should do is go into televis broadcast __PUNCT__
i tell you __PUNCT__ you got a futur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ no offens to my friend with the microphon in the back of the room __PUNCT__ but boi am i glad i didn't listen to that old man __PUNCT__
i kept go to chicago __PUNCT__ and when i got there and saw the jobless and hopeless that exist in those neighborhood __PUNCT__ i knew my job wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__
but i work hard to build coalit with all kind of commun leader __PUNCT__ and we kept work __PUNCT__ and we set up child care and job train program __PUNCT__ and we taught peopl to stand up to their govern when it wasn't stand up for them __PUNCT__
we didn't chang the world __PUNCT__ but we chang those neighborhood __PUNCT__ and i prove that old man wrong __PUNCT__
and i done the same thing ever sinc __PUNCT__
when i got to the illinoi state senat __PUNCT__ peopl said it wa too tough to take on the issu of monei in polit __PUNCT__ that i couldn't do anyth about a law that actual allow politician to pocket the monei in their campaign account for person us __PUNCT__
but i brought peopl togeth __PUNCT__ and i found a few folk on the other side of the aisl who were will to listen __PUNCT__ and we pass the first major ethic reform in twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__
peopl told me i couldn't reform a death penalti system that had sent __NUM__ innoc peopl to death row __PUNCT__
but we did that __PUNCT__
thei told me that try to pass law to stop racial profil would stir up too much controversi __PUNCT__
but we did that too __PUNCT__
thei doubt whether we could put govern back on the side of averag peopl __PUNCT__ but we put tax cut in the pocket of the work famili who need them instead of the folk who didn't __PUNCT__
and i pass health care reform that insur anoth __NUM__ children and parent __PUNCT__
so i want you to know that i been where you ar __PUNCT__
i look at the world as a young man and i want to make a differ __PUNCT__
and i wa often told that chang wasn't possibl __PUNCT__
but i learn that it wa __PUNCT__ i believ that it still is __PUNCT__ and i readi to join you in chang the cours that we on by bring a new gener of leadership to the unit state of america __PUNCT__
the reason thi presid ha fail to lead our countri is becaus he ha not been abl to unit our countri __PUNCT__
he ha polar us when he could pull us togeth __PUNCT__
he ha put what right for hi friend and support ahead of what right for america __PUNCT__
that why the experi we need in the next presid is the abil to bring thi countri togeth __PUNCT__ to find common ground so we can meet common challeng __PUNCT__
that the kind of experi i will bring to the white hous __PUNCT__
i know it not enough to just chang parti or even presid __PUNCT__
i know that to truli chang the wai washington work __PUNCT__ we need to build a movement of everydai american who ar commit to that chang long after the last ballot is count __PUNCT__
and that what we do in thi campaign __PUNCT__
we had more peopl sign up and contribut than ani other campaign in histori __PUNCT__
we had countless peopl show up at our event who ar come to the first polit event of their lifetim __PUNCT__
thei ar young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ gai and straight __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ and asian __PUNCT__

i have a univers health care plan that will cover everi american and cut the cost of a typic famili premium by up to __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
it a plan that let the uninsur bui insur that similar to the kind member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
if you can't afford that __PUNCT__ you get a subsidi to pai for it __PUNCT__
and here someth we includ after hear about it from young peopl across the countri __PUNCT__ if you graduat and don't find a job that provid health insur right awai __PUNCT__ you be abl to stai on your parent __PUNCT__ insur until you twenti __PUNCT__ five __PUNCT__

it time to get that done __PUNCT__

it time to tell all those privat lender and bank that we not go to give them eight billion in taxpay dollar everi year so that thei can bribe colleg to get busi give student loan at inflat price __PUNCT__
we not go to make colleg an unafford opportun or saddl our student with a lifetim of debt __PUNCT__
it time to end those high __PUNCT__ price loan and us the save to help more kid afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__
and it time we had a presid who fight for that propos instead of threaten to veto it __PUNCT__
the veri first bill i introduc when i got to the u. __PUNCT__ senat wa a bill to make colleg more afford and provid more grant to student __PUNCT__
that the kind of leadership we need __PUNCT__
it time for a new gener of leadership to save our gener from global catastroph __PUNCT__

refus to engag in tough __PUNCT__ smart diplomaci with world leader we don't like doesn't show your strength __PUNCT__ it show your stubborn __PUNCT__ and we don't need anoth eight year of that __PUNCT__
whether it terror or climat chang __PUNCT__ global aid or the spread of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ america cannot meet the threat of thi new centuri alon __PUNCT__ but the world cannot meet them without america __PUNCT__
