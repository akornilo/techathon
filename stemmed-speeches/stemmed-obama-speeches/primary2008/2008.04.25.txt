everywher i go in indiana __PUNCT__ and across thi countri __PUNCT__ i talk to folk who ar work harder and harder just to get by __PUNCT__
at a time when our economi is in turmoil and wage ar stagnant __PUNCT__ hardwork famili ar struggl to pai rise cost __PUNCT__ and few cost ar rise more than the on folk pai at the pump __PUNCT__
for the well __PUNCT__ off in thi countri __PUNCT__ high ga price ar mostli an annoy __PUNCT__ but to most american __PUNCT__ thei a huge problem __PUNCT__ border on a crisi __PUNCT__
here in indiana __PUNCT__ ga cost about __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__ and across the countri __PUNCT__ ga cost more than at ani time in almost thirti year __PUNCT__
over the last year alon __PUNCT__ the price of oil ha shot up more than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ reach a record high of more than __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__ all of which help explain why the top oil compani made __MONEY__ billion last year __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there noth wrong with a compani be reward for it success __PUNCT__
our economi ha alwai been power by innov and ingenu __PUNCT__
but the reason american keep go to the pump isn't becaus oil compani ar be particularli innov __PUNCT__
it becaus washington politician didn't deal with the challeng of altern energi when thei had the chanc __PUNCT__
when georg bush ask dick chenei to come up with our energi polici a few year ago __PUNCT__ he met with the environment group onc __PUNCT__ and he met with the renew energi folk onc __PUNCT__ and he met with the oil and ga compani __NUM__ time __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ we also know thi problem goe deeper than the bush administr __PUNCT__
becaus we been talk about high ga price in thi countri sinc american were sit in ga line in the 1970 __PUNCT__
and we heard promis about energi independ from everi presid __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ sinc richard nixon __PUNCT__
and yet the onli thing that differ now is that we ar even more depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ our planet is in even greater peril __PUNCT__ and the price of ga keep go up and up and up __PUNCT__
so unless we will to challeng the broken system in washington __PUNCT__ and stop let lobbyist us their clout to get their wai __PUNCT__ noth els is go to chang __PUNCT__
and the reason i run for presid is to challeng that system __PUNCT__
i the onli candid in thi race who work to rein in the power of lobbyist by pass histor ethic reform in illinoi and in the senat __PUNCT__ and i the onli on who isn't take a dime from washington lobbyist __PUNCT__
we need a presid who look out for famili in indiana __PUNCT__ not just do what good for multin corpor __PUNCT__ and that the kind of presid i be __PUNCT__
it isn't right that oil compani ar make record profit at a time when ordinari american ar go into debt try to pai rise energi cost __PUNCT__
in the paper todai __PUNCT__ there wa an articl about how million of american ar fall behind on their energi bill __PUNCT__ and a record number of american could face energi shut __PUNCT__ off over the next two month __PUNCT__
that why we put a windfal profit tax on oil compani and us it to help indiana famili pai their heat and cool bill and reduc energi cost __PUNCT__
we also take step to reduc the price of oil and increas transpar in how price ar set so we can ensur that energi compani aren't bend the rule __PUNCT__
and to help indiana famili meet the rise cost of ga __PUNCT__ we put a middl class tax cut in their pocket that will save them __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ and we elimin incom tax altogeth for senior make less than __MONEY__
so these ar a few short __PUNCT__ term step we can take to eas the burden that indiana famili ar bear as a result of our fail energi polici __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ there is no easi answer to our energi crisi __PUNCT__ and we need a presid who go to be straight with us about that __PUNCT__ a presid who go to tell the american peopl not just what thei want to hear __PUNCT__ but what thei need to know __PUNCT__
and what thei need to know is that ani real solut isn't go to come about overnight __PUNCT__
it go to take time __PUNCT__
to bring about real chang __PUNCT__ we go to have to make long __PUNCT__ term invest in clean energi and energi effici __PUNCT__
that why i reach across the aisl in the senat to come up with a plan to doubl our fuel effici standard that won support of lawmak who had never support rais those standard befor __PUNCT__
and that why i vote for an energi bill that wa far from perfect becaus it wa the largest invest in renew energi in histori __PUNCT__ and i fought to elimin the tax giveawai to oil compani that were slip into that bill __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i work to solv thi energi crisi onc and for all __PUNCT__
we invest __MONEY__ billion over the next ten year in establish a green energi sector that will creat up to __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and those ar job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
we invest in clean energi like solar __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ and biodiesel __PUNCT__
and we help make sure that the fuel we us is more effici __PUNCT__
the candid with the washington experi __PUNCT__ my oppon __PUNCT__ ar good peopl __PUNCT__
thei mean well __PUNCT__
but thei been in washington for a long time __PUNCT__ and even with all that experi thei talk about __PUNCT__ noth ha happen __PUNCT__
thi countri didn't rais fuel effici standard for over thirti year __PUNCT__
so what have we got for all that experi __PUNCT__ ga that approach __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__ becaus you can fight all you want insid washington __PUNCT__ but until you chang the wai it work __PUNCT__ you won't be abl to make the chang american need __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ we onli eas the burden of ga price on our famili when hoosier and peopl all across america sai __PUNCT__ enough __PUNCT__
it time to free ourselv from the tyranni of oil __PUNCT__ and stop fund both side in the war on terror __PUNCT__
it time to save thi planet for our children __PUNCT__
the time is now __PUNCT__ not after the next elect or the on after that __PUNCT__
you shouldn't accept ani more excus for why it can't be done __PUNCT__
it won't happen tomorrow __PUNCT__
but if we can come togeth in thi elect __PUNCT__ we can and will begin __PUNCT__ and the first step is chang the wai busi is done in washington __PUNCT__
if we can do that __PUNCT__ then the energi crisi is on i confid we can solv __PUNCT__
