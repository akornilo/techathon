but as someon who share a stage with her mani time __PUNCT__ i can tell you that what get hillari clinton up in the morn __PUNCT__ even in the face of tough odd __PUNCT__ is exactli what sent her and bill clinton to sign up for their first campaign in texa all those year ago __PUNCT__ what sent her to work at the children defens fund and made her fight for health care as first ladi __PUNCT__ what led her to the unit state senat and fuel her barrier __PUNCT__ break campaign for the presid __PUNCT__ an unyield desir to improv the live of ordinari american __PUNCT__ no matter how difficult the fight mai be __PUNCT__

there ar those who sai that thi primari ha somehow left us weaker and more divid __PUNCT__
well i sai that becaus of thi primari __PUNCT__ there ar million of american who have cast their ballot for the veri first time __PUNCT__
there ar independ and republican who understand that thi elect isn't just about the parti in charg of washington __PUNCT__ it about the need to chang washington __PUNCT__

all of you chose to support a candid you believ in deepli __PUNCT__
but at the end of the dai __PUNCT__ we aren't the reason you came out and wait in line that stretch block after block to make your voic heard __PUNCT__
you didn't do that becaus of me or senat clinton or anyon els __PUNCT__
you did it becaus you know in your heart that at thi moment __PUNCT__ a moment that will defin a gener __PUNCT__ we cannot afford to keep do what we been do __PUNCT__
we ow our children a better futur __PUNCT__
we ow our countri a better futur __PUNCT__
and for all those who dream of that futur tonight __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__ let us begin the work togeth __PUNCT__
let us unit in common effort to chart a new cours for america __PUNCT__
in just a few short month __PUNCT__ the republican parti will arriv in st __PUNCT__ paul with a veri differ agenda __PUNCT__
thei will come here to nomin john mccain __PUNCT__ a man who ha serv thi countri heroic __PUNCT__
i honor that servic __PUNCT__ and i respect hi mani accomplish __PUNCT__ even if he choos to deni mine __PUNCT__
my differ with him ar not person __PUNCT__ thei ar with the polici he ha propos in thi campaign __PUNCT__
becaus while john mccain can legitim tout moment of independ from hi parti in the past __PUNCT__ such independ ha not been the hallmark of hi presidenti campaign __PUNCT__
it not chang when john mccain decid to stand with georg bush nineti __PUNCT__ five percent of the time __PUNCT__ as he did in the senat last year __PUNCT__
it not chang when he offer four more year of bush econom polici that have fail to creat well __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__ or insur our worker __PUNCT__ or help american afford the skyrocket cost of colleg __PUNCT__ polici that have lower the real incom of the averag american famili __PUNCT__ widen the gap between wall street and main street __PUNCT__ and left our children with a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
and it not chang when he promis to continu a polici in iraq that ask everyth of our brave men and women in uniform and noth of iraqi politician __PUNCT__ a polici where all we look for ar reason to stai in iraq __PUNCT__ while we spend billion of dollar a month on a war that isn't make the american peopl ani safer __PUNCT__
so i sai thi __PUNCT__ there ar mani word to describ john mccain attempt to pass off hi embrac of georg bush polici as bipartisan and new __PUNCT__
but chang is not on of them __PUNCT__
chang is a foreign polici that doesn't begin and end with a war that should never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
i won't stand here and pretend that there ar mani good option left in iraq __PUNCT__ but what not an option is leav our troop in that countri for the next hundr year __PUNCT__ especi at a time when our militari is overstretch __PUNCT__ our nation is isol __PUNCT__ and nearli everi other threat to america is be ignor __PUNCT__
we must be as care get out of iraq as we were careless get in __PUNCT__ but start leav we must __PUNCT__
it time for iraqi to take respons for their futur __PUNCT__
it time to rebuild our militari and give our veteran the care thei need and the benefit thei deserv when thei come home __PUNCT__
it time to refocu our effort on al qaeda leadership and afghanistan __PUNCT__ and ralli the world against the common threat of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ terror and nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ climat chang and poverti __PUNCT__ genocid and diseas __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
chang is realiz that meet todai threat requir not just our firepow __PUNCT__ but the power of our diplomaci __PUNCT__ tough __PUNCT__ direct diplomaci where the presid of the unit state isn't afraid to let ani petti dictat know where america stand and what we stand for __PUNCT__
we must onc again have the courag and convict to lead the free world __PUNCT__
that is the legaci of roosevelt __PUNCT__ and truman __PUNCT__ and kennedi __PUNCT__
that what the american peopl want __PUNCT__
that what chang is __PUNCT__
chang is build an economi that reward not just wealth __PUNCT__ but the work and worker who creat it __PUNCT__
it understand that the struggl face work famili can't be solv by spend billion of dollar on more tax break for big corpor and wealthi ceo __PUNCT__ but by give a the middl __PUNCT__ class a tax break __PUNCT__ and invest in our crumbl infrastructur __PUNCT__ and transform how we us energi __PUNCT__ and improv our school __PUNCT__ and renew our commit to scienc and innov __PUNCT__
it understand that fiscal respons and share prosper can go hand __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ hand __PUNCT__ as thei did when bill clinton wa presid __PUNCT__
john mccain ha spent a lot of time talk about trip to iraq in the last few week __PUNCT__ but mayb if he spent some time take trip to the citi and town that have been hardest hit by thi economi __PUNCT__ citi in michigan __PUNCT__ and ohio __PUNCT__ and right here in minnesota __PUNCT__ he understand the kind of chang that peopl ar look for __PUNCT__
mayb if he went to iowa and met the student who work the night shift after a full dai of class and still can't pai the medic bill for a sister who ill __PUNCT__ he understand that she can't afford four more year of a health care plan that onli take care of the healthi and wealthi __PUNCT__
she need us to pass health care plan that guarante insur to everi american who want it and bring down premium for everi famili who need it __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
mayb if he went to pennsylvania and met the man who lost hi job but can't even afford the ga to drive around and look for a new on __PUNCT__ he understand that we can't afford four more year of our addict to oil from dictat __PUNCT__
that man need us to pass an energi polici that work with automak to rais fuel standard __PUNCT__ and make corpor pai for their pollut __PUNCT__ and oil compani invest their record profit in a clean energi futur __PUNCT__ an energi polici that will creat million of new job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
and mayb if he spent some time in the school of south carolina or st __PUNCT__ paul or where he spoke tonight in new orlean __PUNCT__ he understand that we can't afford to leav the monei behind for no child left behind __PUNCT__ that we ow it to our children to invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ to recruit an armi of new teacher and give them better pai and more support __PUNCT__ to final decid that in thi global economi __PUNCT__ the chanc to get a colleg educ should not be a privileg for the wealthi few __PUNCT__ but the birthright of everi american __PUNCT__
that the chang we need in america __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid __PUNCT__
the other side will come here in __DATE__ and offer a veri differ set of polici and posit __PUNCT__ and that is a debat i look forward to __PUNCT__
it is a debat the american peopl deserv __PUNCT__
but what you don't deserv is anoth elect that govern by fear __PUNCT__ and innuendo __PUNCT__ and divis __PUNCT__
what you won't hear from thi campaign or thi parti is the kind of polit that us religion as a wedg __PUNCT__ and patriot as a bludgeon __PUNCT__ that see our oppon not as competitor to challeng __PUNCT__ but enemi to demon __PUNCT__
becaus we mai call ourselv democrat and republican __PUNCT__ but we ar american first __PUNCT__
we ar alwai american first __PUNCT__
despit what the good senat from arizona said tonight __PUNCT__ i have seen peopl of differ view and opinion find common caus mani time dure my two decad in public life __PUNCT__ and i have brought mani togeth myself __PUNCT__
i walk arm __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ arm with commun leader on the south side of chicago and watch tension fade as black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ and latino fought togeth for good job and good school __PUNCT__
i sat across the tabl from law enforc and civil right advoc to reform a crimin justic system that sent thirteen innoc peopl to death row __PUNCT__
and i work with friend in the other parti to provid more children with health insur and more work famili with a tax break __PUNCT__ to curb the spread of nuclear weapon and ensur that the american peopl know where their tax dollar ar be spent __PUNCT__ and to reduc the influenc of lobbyist who have all too often set the agenda in washington __PUNCT__
in our countri __PUNCT__ i have found that thi cooper happen not becaus we agre on everyth __PUNCT__ but becaus behind all the label and fals divis and categori that defin us __PUNCT__ beyond all the petti bicker and point __PUNCT__ score in washington __PUNCT__ american ar a decent __PUNCT__ gener __PUNCT__ compassion peopl __PUNCT__ unit by common challeng and common hope __PUNCT__
and everi so often __PUNCT__ there ar moment which call on that fundament good to make thi countri great again __PUNCT__
so it wa for that band of patriot who declar in a philadelphia hall the format of a more perfect union __PUNCT__ and for all those who gave on the field of gettysburg and antietam their last full measur of devot to save that same union __PUNCT__
so it wa for the greatest gener that conquer fear itself __PUNCT__ and liber a contin from tyranni __PUNCT__ and made thi countri home to untold opportun and prosper __PUNCT__
so it wa for the worker who stood out on the picket line __PUNCT__ the women who shatter glass ceil __PUNCT__ the children who brave a selma bridg for freedom caus __PUNCT__
so it ha been for everi gener that face down the greatest challeng and the most improb odd to leav their children a world that better __PUNCT__ and kinder __PUNCT__ and more just __PUNCT__
and so it must be for us __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ thi is our moment __PUNCT__
thi is our time __PUNCT__
our time to turn the page on the polici of the past __PUNCT__
our time to bring new energi and new idea to the challeng we face __PUNCT__
our time to offer a new direct for the countri we love __PUNCT__
the journei will be difficult __PUNCT__
the road will be long __PUNCT__
i face thi challeng with profound humil __PUNCT__ and knowledg of my own limit __PUNCT__
but i also face it with limitless faith in the capac of the american peopl __PUNCT__
becaus if we ar will to work for it __PUNCT__ and fight for it __PUNCT__ and believ in it __PUNCT__ then i am absolut certain that gener from now __PUNCT__ we will be abl to look back and tell our children that thi wa the moment when we began to provid care for the sick and good job to the jobless __PUNCT__ thi wa the moment when the rise of the ocean began to slow and our planet began to heal __PUNCT__ thi wa the moment when we end a war and secur our nation and restor our imag as the last __PUNCT__ best hope on earth __PUNCT__
thi wa the moment __PUNCT__ thi wa the time __PUNCT__ when we came togeth to remak thi great nation so that it mai alwai reflect our veri best selv __PUNCT__ and our highest ideal __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ god bless you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
