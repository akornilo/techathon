then __PUNCT__ when i wa about your ag __PUNCT__ i decid to becom a commun organ __PUNCT__
i wrote letter to everi organ in the countri that i could think of __PUNCT__
and for a while __PUNCT__ i got no respons __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ thi small group of church on the south side of chicago wrote back and offer me a job to come help neighborhood devast by steel __PUNCT__ plant close __PUNCT__
my mother and grandpar want me to go to law school __PUNCT__
my friend were appli to job on wall street __PUNCT__
i didn't know a soul in chicago __PUNCT__ and the salari wa about __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ plu __MONEY__ to bui an old __PUNCT__ beat __PUNCT__ up car __PUNCT__
i still rememb a convers i had with an older man befor i left __PUNCT__
he look and said __PUNCT__ barack __PUNCT__ i give you a bit of advic __PUNCT__
forget thi commun organ busi and do someth that gonna make you some monei __PUNCT__
you can't chang the world __PUNCT__ and peopl won't appreci you try __PUNCT__
you got a nice voic __PUNCT__
what you should do is go into televis broadcast __PUNCT__
i tell you __PUNCT__ you got a futur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ he mai have had a point about the tv thing __PUNCT__
and to tell you the truth __PUNCT__ i didn't have a clear answer about what i wa do __PUNCT__
i want to step into the current of histori and help peopl fight for their dream __PUNCT__ but didn't know what my role would be __PUNCT__
i wa inspir by what peopl like harri did in the civil right movement __PUNCT__ but when i got to chicago __PUNCT__ there were no march __PUNCT__ no soar speech __PUNCT__
in the shadow of an empti steel plant __PUNCT__ there were just a lot of folk struggl __PUNCT__
dai after dai __PUNCT__ i heard __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ a lot more than i heard __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
i saw plenti of empti chair in those meet we put togeth __PUNCT__
but even as i discov that you can't bend histori to your will __PUNCT__ i found that you could do your part to see that __PUNCT__ in the word of dr __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ bend toward justic __PUNCT__
in church basement and around kitchen tabl __PUNCT__ block by block __PUNCT__ we brought the commun togeth __PUNCT__ regist new voter __PUNCT__ fought for new job __PUNCT__ and help peopl live live with some measur of digniti __PUNCT__
eventu __PUNCT__ i realiz i wasn't just help other peopl __PUNCT__
through servic __PUNCT__ i found a commun that embrac me __PUNCT__ a church to belong to __PUNCT__ citizenship that wa meaning __PUNCT__ the direct i been seek __PUNCT__
through servic __PUNCT__ i found that my own improb stori fit into a larger american stori __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ each of us seek our own dream __PUNCT__ but the sum of those dream must be greater than ourselv __PUNCT__
becaus the america we inherit is the legaci of those who struggl __PUNCT__ and those who serv in so mani wai __PUNCT__ befor us __PUNCT__
it the legaci of a band of unlik patriot who overthrew the tyranni of a king __PUNCT__
it the legaci of abolitionist who stood up __PUNCT__ and soldier who fought for a more perfect union __PUNCT__
it the legaci of those who start to teach in our school and tend to the sick in our citi __PUNCT__ who laid the rail and volunt to uphold the law as america move west __PUNCT__
it the legaci of men who face the depress by put on the uniform of the civilian conserv corp __PUNCT__ of women who work on that arsen of democraci and built the tank and ship and bomber aircraft to fight fascism __PUNCT__
it the legaci of those women suffragist and freedom rider who stood up for justic __PUNCT__ and young peopl who answer presid kennedi call to go forth in a peac corp __PUNCT__
the sacrific made by previou gener have never been easi __PUNCT__
but america is a great nation precis becaus american have been will to stand up when it wa hard __PUNCT__ to serv on stage both great and small __PUNCT__ to rise abov moment of great challeng and terribl trial __PUNCT__
on of those moment took place on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
whether you live in manhattan or here in mount vernon __PUNCT__ you felt the pain and loss of that dai not just as an individu __PUNCT__ but as an american __PUNCT__
that why we line up to give blood __PUNCT__
that why we held vigil and flew flag __PUNCT__
that why we ralli behind our presid __PUNCT__
we had a chanc to step into the current of histori __PUNCT__
we were readi to answer a new call for our countri __PUNCT__
but the call never came __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we were ask to go shop __PUNCT__ and to prove our patriot by support a war in iraq that should never have been author __PUNCT__ and never been wage __PUNCT__
we have lost preciou time __PUNCT__
our nation is less secur and less respect in the world __PUNCT__
our energi depend ha risen __PUNCT__ and so ha the specter of climat chang __PUNCT__
more of our children have been left behind __PUNCT__
instead of a call to uniti __PUNCT__ we got a polit strategi of divis __PUNCT__
the burden of servic ha fallen __PUNCT__ more and more __PUNCT__ on the brave men and women of our militari who heroic serv tour after tour of duti in a war without end __PUNCT__
when i wa think about whether or not to seek the presid __PUNCT__ there were some voic who counsel me to wait __PUNCT__
you seem like a gift young man __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ why not wait around washington a few more year __PUNCT__ or when i start talk about a polit of hope __PUNCT__ some just roll their ey and echo the word of that man from my younger dai __PUNCT__ you can't chang the world __PUNCT__ and peopl won't appreci you try __PUNCT__
well i am run for presid __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ becaus i refus to let thi moment pass __PUNCT__
the decis we make todai will shape the centuri that my daughter __PUNCT__ and your children __PUNCT__ grow up in __PUNCT__
i have not serv the caus of america for over two decad to stai on the sidelin at a time when that caus is be challeng at home and abroad __PUNCT__
if we don't rise up to seiz thi moment __PUNCT__ then we mai not get anoth __PUNCT__
i have no doubt that in the face of imposs odd peopl who love their countri can chang it __PUNCT__
but i hold no illus that on man or woman can do thi alon __PUNCT__
that why my campaign ha call nearli __NUM__ american to a common purpos __PUNCT__
that why i reach out to democrat __PUNCT__ and also to independ and republican __PUNCT__
and that is why i won't just ask for your vote as a candid __PUNCT__ i will ask for your servic and your activ citizenship when i am presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
thi will not be a call issu in on speech or program __PUNCT__ thi will be a caus of my presid __PUNCT__

american have shown thei want to step up __PUNCT__

fdr not onli enlist american to creat employ __PUNCT__ he target that servic to build our infrastructur and conserv our environ __PUNCT__
jfk not onli call on a new gener __PUNCT__ he made their servic a bridg to the develop world __PUNCT__ and a bright light of american valu in the darkest dai of the cold war __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ americorp __PUNCT__ our nation network of local __PUNCT__ state and nation servic program __PUNCT__ ha __NUM__ slot __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will increas that to __NUM__ and make that increas servic a vehicl to meet nation goal like provid health care and educ __PUNCT__ save our planet and restor our stand in the world __PUNCT__ so that citizen see their effort connect to a common purpos __PUNCT__
peopl of all ag __PUNCT__ station __PUNCT__ and skill will be ask to serv __PUNCT__
becaus when it come to the challeng we face __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar not the problem __PUNCT__ thei ar the answer __PUNCT__
to help everi american receiv a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ we will creat a new classroom corp __PUNCT__
we have colleg student __PUNCT__ recent graduat and retire mentor young peopl __PUNCT__ engin and scientist will help make sure the next gener of innov is educ here in america __PUNCT__ civic __PUNCT__ busi and faith leader will develop new after school program for our kid __PUNCT__
to free ourselv from energi depend and to confront climat chang __PUNCT__ we will creat a new energi corp __PUNCT__
we ask you to work on renew energi project __PUNCT__ to teach folk about conserv __PUNCT__ and to help clean up pollut area __PUNCT__
and we send talent american engin and scientist abroad to help develop countri promot low __PUNCT__ carbon energi develop __PUNCT__
to restor america stand __PUNCT__ i will call on our greatest resourc __PUNCT__ not our bomb __PUNCT__ gun __PUNCT__ or dollar __PUNCT__ i will call upon our peopl __PUNCT__
we will grow the foreign servic to renew our commit to diplomaci __PUNCT__
we will doubl the size of the peac corp by it __NUM__ anniversari in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and we reach out to other nation to engag their young peopl in similar program __PUNCT__ so that we work side by side to take on the common challeng that confront all human __PUNCT__
i will expand our militari __PUNCT__ while offer those who serv the promis that thei will get the train __PUNCT__ equip __PUNCT__ and care thei deserv __PUNCT__ and that thei can trust we will never __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__ send them to fight in a misguid war __PUNCT__
and we enlist veteran to help other veteran find job __PUNCT__ to counsel vet who ar confront homeless __PUNCT__ mental health and substanc abus problem __PUNCT__ and to pitch in at va hospit and nurs home __PUNCT__
some of these program will be full __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ some will be part time opportun for those who ar work __PUNCT__
and we expand and improv senior corp program to attract new retire with substant servic opportun __PUNCT__ so that servic becom a core part of activ retir
and we us technolog to connect peopl to servic more extens and effect __PUNCT__
we turn to websit like craigslist to find apart and job __PUNCT__

you be abl to search by categori __PUNCT__ time commit __PUNCT__ and skill set __PUNCT__ you be abl to rate servic opportun __PUNCT__ build servic network __PUNCT__ and creat your own servic page to track your hour and activ __PUNCT__
thi will empow more american to craft their own servic agenda __PUNCT__ and make their own chang from the bottom up __PUNCT__
the second thing i do is invest in idea that can help us meet our common challeng __PUNCT__ becaus more often than not the next great social innov won't be gener by the govern __PUNCT__
the non __PUNCT__ profit sector emploi __NUM__ in __NUM__ american and __NUM__ nonprofit ar launch everi dai __PUNCT__
yet while the feder govern invest __MONEY__ billion in research and develop for the privat sector __PUNCT__ there is no similar effort to support non __PUNCT__ profit innov __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ there ar idea across america __PUNCT__ in our inner citi and small town __PUNCT__ from colleg graduat to folk make a career chang __PUNCT__ that could benefit million of american if thei given the chanc to grow __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a new social invest fund network __PUNCT__
it time to get the grass root __PUNCT__ the foundat __PUNCT__ the privat sector and the govern at the tabl __PUNCT__
we invest in idea that work __PUNCT__ leverag privat sector dollar to encourag innov __PUNCT__ and expand success program to scale __PUNCT__
take a program like the harlem children zone __PUNCT__ which help thousand of kid in new york through after __PUNCT__ school activ __PUNCT__ mentor __PUNCT__ and famili support __PUNCT__
we need to make that model work in differ citi around the countri __PUNCT__
and i start a new social entrepreneur agenc to make sure that small non __PUNCT__ profit have the same kind of support that we give small busi __PUNCT__
the third part of my plan will be integr servic into educ __PUNCT__ so that young american ar call upon and prepar to be activ citizen __PUNCT__
just as we teach math and write __PUNCT__ art and athlet __PUNCT__ we need to teach young american to take citizenship serious __PUNCT__
studi after studi show that student who serv do better in school __PUNCT__ ar more like to go to colleg __PUNCT__ and more like to maintain that servic as adult __PUNCT__
so when i presid __PUNCT__ i will set a goal for all american middl and high school student to perform __NUM__ hour of servic a year __PUNCT__ and for all colleg student to perform __NUM__ hour of servic a year __PUNCT__
thi mean that by the time you graduat colleg __PUNCT__ you have done __NUM__ week of servic __PUNCT__
we reach thi goal in sever wai __PUNCT__
at the middl and high school level __PUNCT__ we make feder assist condit on school district develop servic program __PUNCT__ and give school resourc to offer new servic opportun __PUNCT__
at the commun level __PUNCT__ we develop public __PUNCT__ privat partnership so student can serv more outsid the classroom __PUNCT__
for colleg student __PUNCT__ i have propos an annual american opportun tax credit of __MONEY__ to make tuition afford __PUNCT__
to receiv thi credit __PUNCT__ we requir __NUM__ hour of public servic __PUNCT__
and we amend the feder work __PUNCT__ studi program __PUNCT__ so that nearli __MONEY__ million will help more than __NUM__ colleg student work in part __PUNCT__ time public servic job each year __PUNCT__
and we will not leav out the nearli __NUM__ million young american who ar out of school and out of work __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we us servic to tighten their bond to the american famili __PUNCT__ and to put them on a pathwai to success __PUNCT__
we enlist them in a green job corp __PUNCT__ so that disadvantag young peopl can find us work and gain skill in a grow industri __PUNCT__
and we expand the youthbuild program __PUNCT__ which put young american to work build afford hous in america poorest commun __PUNCT__ give them valuabl skill and a chanc to complet a high school educ __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar __NUM__ youthbuild slot __PUNCT__ we expand that to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now i know what the cynic will sai __PUNCT__
i heard from them all my life __PUNCT__
these ar the voic that will tell you __PUNCT__ not just what you can't do __PUNCT__ but what you won't do __PUNCT__
american won't come togeth __PUNCT__ our allegi doesn't go beyond our polit parti __PUNCT__ region __PUNCT__ or congreg __PUNCT__
young american won't serv their countri __PUNCT__ thei too selfish __PUNCT__ or too lazi __PUNCT__
thi is the soft sell of the statu quo __PUNCT__ the voic that tell you to settl becaus settl isn't that bad __PUNCT__
let me ask you to stop and consid thi meet that we have __PUNCT__
you go to the first school in the unit state west of the mississippi to grant women the same right and privileg as men __PUNCT__
you go to a school that resolv in __NUM__ that race would not be a factor in admiss __PUNCT__
these mai be small chang on the vast canva of histori __PUNCT__ but the america we live in is the sum total of that kind of courag __PUNCT__ that spirit of progress __PUNCT__
if it weren't for that kind of chang __PUNCT__ it wouldn't be possibl for someon like me to stand here todai to talk to you about the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
you and i ar at a place where somebodi __PUNCT__ at some point __PUNCT__ decid that love their commun and their countri meant do someth to chang it __PUNCT__
renew that spirit start with servic __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ our destini as american is ti up with on anoth __PUNCT__
if we ar less respect in the world __PUNCT__ then you will be less safe __PUNCT__
if we keep pai dictat to fill up our ga tank __PUNCT__ then those ocean ar go to rise __PUNCT__
if we can't give our kid a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ then our economi is go to fall behind __PUNCT__
and that how it should be __PUNCT__
it is time to recaptur that sens of a common purpos __PUNCT__ i am my brother keeper __PUNCT__ i am my sister keeper __PUNCT__
i tire of hear about how america is on the wrong track __PUNCT__ i want us to come togeth to put it on the right track __PUNCT__
i tire of hear about red america and blue america __PUNCT__ i want to lead a unit state of america __PUNCT__
i tire of talk about what we can't do __PUNCT__ or won't do __PUNCT__ or won't even try __PUNCT__ i want all of us to stand up and to start reach for what is possibl __PUNCT__
that what histori call us to do __PUNCT__
becaus love your countri shouldn't just mean watch firework on the __NUM__ of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ love your countri must mean accept your respons to do your part to chang it __PUNCT__
and if you do stand up __PUNCT__ i promis you that your life will be richer __PUNCT__ and our countri will be stronger __PUNCT__
