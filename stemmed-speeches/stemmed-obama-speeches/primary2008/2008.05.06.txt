the peopl i met in small town and big citi across thi countri understand that govern can't solv all our problem __PUNCT__ and we don't expect it to __PUNCT__
we believ in hard work __PUNCT__
we believ in person respons and self __PUNCT__ relianc __PUNCT__
but we also believ that we have a larger respons to on anoth as american __PUNCT__ that america is a place __PUNCT__ that america is the place __PUNCT__ where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__

that the america i know __PUNCT__
thi is the countri that gave my grandfath a chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill when he came home from world war ii __PUNCT__ a countri that gave him and my grandmoth the chanc to bui their first home with a loan from the govern __PUNCT__
thi is the countri that made it possibl for my mother __PUNCT__ a singl parent who had to go on food stamp at on point __PUNCT__ to send my sister and me to the best school in the countri on scholarship __PUNCT__
thi is the countri that allow my father __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ a citi worker at a south side water filtrat plant __PUNCT__ to provid for hi wife and two children on a singl salari __PUNCT__
thi is a man who wa diagnos at ag thirti with multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ who reli on a walker to get himself to work __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ everi dai he went __PUNCT__ and he labor __PUNCT__ and he sent my wife and her brother to on of the best colleg in the nation __PUNCT__
it wa a job that didn't just give him a paycheck __PUNCT__ but a sens of digniti and self __PUNCT__ worth __PUNCT__
it wa an america that didn't just reward wealth __PUNCT__ but the work and the worker who creat it __PUNCT__
somewher along the wai __PUNCT__ between all the bicker and the influenc __PUNCT__ peddl and the game __PUNCT__ plai of the last few decad __PUNCT__ washington and wall street have lost touch with these valu __PUNCT__
and while i honor john mccain servic to hi countri __PUNCT__ hi idea for america ar out of touch with these valu __PUNCT__
hi plan for the futur ar noth more than the fail polici of the past __PUNCT__
and hi plan to win in __DATE__ appear to come from the veri same playbook that hi side ha us time after time in elect after elect __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we know what come __PUNCT__
we seen it alreadi __PUNCT__
the same name and label thei alwai pin on everyon who doesn't agre with all their idea __PUNCT__
the same effort to distract us from the issu that affect our live by pounc on everi gaff and associ and fake controversi in the hope that the media will plai along __PUNCT__
the attempt to plai on our fear and exploit our differ to turn us against each other for pure polit gain __PUNCT__ to slice and dice thi countri into red state and blue state __PUNCT__ blue __PUNCT__ collar and white __PUNCT__ collar __PUNCT__ white and black __PUNCT__ and brown __PUNCT__
thi is what thei will do __PUNCT__ no matter which on of us is the nomine __PUNCT__
the question __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ is not what kind of campaign thei run __PUNCT__ it what kind of campaign we will run __PUNCT__
it what we will do to make thi year differ __PUNCT__
i didn't get into race think that i could avoid thi kind of polit __PUNCT__ but i am run for presid becaus thi is the time to end it __PUNCT__
we will end it thi time not becaus i perfect __PUNCT__ i think by now thi campaign ha remind all of us of that __PUNCT__
we will end it not by duplic the same tactic and the same strategi as the other side __PUNCT__ becaus that will just lead us down the same path of polar and gridlock __PUNCT__
we will end it by tell the truth __PUNCT__ forcefulli __PUNCT__ repeatedli __PUNCT__ confid __PUNCT__ and by trust that the american peopl will embrac the need for chang __PUNCT__
becaus that how we alwai chang thi countri __PUNCT__ not from the top __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ but from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ when you __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__ decid that the stake ar too high and the challeng ar too great __PUNCT__
the other side can label and name __PUNCT__ call all thei want __PUNCT__ but i trust the american peopl to recogn that it not surrend to end the war in iraq so that we can rebuild our militari and go after al qaeda leader __PUNCT__
i trust the american peopl to understand that it not weak __PUNCT__ but wisdom to talk not just to our friend __PUNCT__ but our enemi __PUNCT__ like roosevelt did __PUNCT__ and kennedi did __PUNCT__ and truman did __PUNCT__
i trust the american peopl to realiz that while we don't need big govern __PUNCT__ we do need a govern that stand up for famili who ar be trick out of their home by wall street predat __PUNCT__ a govern that stand up for the middl __PUNCT__ class by give them a tax break __PUNCT__ a govern that ensur that no american will ever lose their life save just becaus their child get sick __PUNCT__
secur and opportun __PUNCT__ compass and prosper aren't liber valu or conserv valu __PUNCT__ thei american valu __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ i trust the american peopl desir to no longer be defin by our differ __PUNCT__
becaus no matter where i been in thi countri __PUNCT__ whether it wa the corn field of iowa or the textil mill of the carolina __PUNCT__ the street of san antonio or the foothil of georgia __PUNCT__ i found that while we mai have differ stori __PUNCT__ we hold common hope __PUNCT__
we mai not look the same or come from the same place __PUNCT__ but we want to move in the same direct __PUNCT__ toward a better futur for our children and our grandchildren __PUNCT__
that why i in thi race __PUNCT__
i love thi countri too much to see it divid and distract at thi moment in histori __PUNCT__
i believ in our abil to perfect thi union becaus it the onli reason i stand here todai __PUNCT__
and i know the promis of america becaus i have live it __PUNCT__
it is the light of opportun that led my father across an ocean __PUNCT__
it is the found ideal that the flag drape over my grandfath coffin stand for __PUNCT__ it is life __PUNCT__ and liberti __PUNCT__ and the pursuit of happi __PUNCT__
it the simpl truth i learn all those year ago when i work in the shadow of a shutter steel mill on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ that in thi countri __PUNCT__ justic can be won against the greatest of odd __PUNCT__ hope can find it wai back to the darkest of corner __PUNCT__ and when we ar told that we cannot bring about the chang that we seek __PUNCT__ we answer with on voic __PUNCT__ ye we can __PUNCT__
so don't ever forget that thi elect is not about me __PUNCT__ or ani candid __PUNCT__
don't ever forget that thi campaign is about you __PUNCT__ about your hope __PUNCT__ about your dream __PUNCT__ about your struggl __PUNCT__ about secur your portion of the american dream __PUNCT__
don't ever forget that we have a choic in thi countri __PUNCT__ that we can choos not to be divid __PUNCT__ that we can choos not to be afraid __PUNCT__ that we can still choos thi moment to final come togeth and solv the problem we talk about all those other year in all those other elect __PUNCT__
thi time can be differ than all the rest __PUNCT__
thi time we can face down those who sai our road is too long __PUNCT__ that our climb is too steep __PUNCT__ that we can no longer achiev the chang that we seek __PUNCT__
thi is our time to answer the call that so mani gener of american have answer befor __PUNCT__ by insist that by hard work __PUNCT__ and by sacrific __PUNCT__ the american dream will endur __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
