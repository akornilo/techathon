good afternoon __PUNCT__
i know i kept a lot of you gui busi thi weekend with the comment i made last week __PUNCT__
some of you might even be a littl bitter about that __PUNCT__
as i said yesterdai __PUNCT__ i regret some of the word i chose __PUNCT__ partli becaus the wai that these remark have been interpret have offend some peopl and partli becaus thei have serv as on more distract from the critic debat that we must have in thi elect season __PUNCT__
i a person of deep faith __PUNCT__ and my religion ha sustain me through a lot in my life __PUNCT__
i even gave a speech on faith befor i ever start run for presid where i said that democrat __PUNCT__ make a mistak when we fail to acknowledg the power of faith in peopl live __PUNCT__
i also repres a state with a larg number of hunter and sportsmen __PUNCT__ and i understand how import these tradit ar to famili in illinoi and all across america __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ contrari to what my poor word choic mai have impli or my oppon have suggest __PUNCT__ i never believ that these tradit or peopl faith ha anyth to do with how much monei thei have __PUNCT__
but i will never walk awai from the larger point that i wa try to make __PUNCT__
for the last sever decad __PUNCT__ peopl in small town and citi and rural area all across thi countri have seen global chang the rule of the game on them __PUNCT__
when i began my career as an organ on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ i saw what happen when the local steel mill shut it door and move oversea __PUNCT__
you don't just lose the job in the mill __PUNCT__ you start lose job and busi throughout the commun __PUNCT__
the street ar emptier __PUNCT__
the school suffer __PUNCT__
i saw it dure my campaign for the senat in illinoi when i talk to union gui who had work at the local maytag plant for twenti __PUNCT__ thirti year befor be laid off at fifti __PUNCT__ five year old when it pick up and move to mexico __PUNCT__ and thei had no idea what thei go to do without the paycheck or the pension that thei count on __PUNCT__
on man didn't even know if he be abl to afford the liver transplant hi son need now that hi health care wa gone __PUNCT__
i heard these stori almost everi dai dure thi campaign __PUNCT__ whether it wa in iowa or ohio or pennsylvania __PUNCT__
and the peopl i met have also told me that everi year __PUNCT__ in everi elect __PUNCT__ politician come to their town __PUNCT__ and thei tell them what thei want to hear __PUNCT__ and thei make big promis __PUNCT__ and then thei go back to washington when the campaign over __PUNCT__ and noth chang __PUNCT__
there no plan to address the downsid of global __PUNCT__
we don't do anyth about the skyrocket cost of health care or colleg or those disappear pension __PUNCT__
instead of fight to replac job that aren't come back __PUNCT__ washington end up fight over the latest distract of the week __PUNCT__
and after year and year and year of thi __PUNCT__ a lot of peopl in thi countri have becom cynic about what govern can do to improv their live __PUNCT__
thei ar angri and frustrat with their leader for not listen to them __PUNCT__ for not fight for them __PUNCT__ for not alwai tell them the truth __PUNCT__
and ye __PUNCT__ thei ar bitter about that __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat mccain and the republican in washington ar alreadi look ahead to the fall and have decid that thei plan on us these comment to argu that i out of touch with what go on in the live of work american __PUNCT__
i don't blame them for thi __PUNCT__ that the natur of our polit cultur __PUNCT__ and if i had to carri the banner for eight year of georg bush failur __PUNCT__ i be look for someth els to talk about too __PUNCT__
but i will sai thi __PUNCT__
if john mccain want to turn thi elect into a contest about which parti is out of touch with the struggl and the hope of work america __PUNCT__ that a debat i happi to have __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i think that a debat we need to have __PUNCT__
becaus i believ that the real insult to the million of hard __PUNCT__ work american out there would be a continu of the econom agenda that ha domin washington for far too long __PUNCT__
i mai have made a mistak last week in the word that i chose __PUNCT__ but the other parti ha made a much more damag mistak in the fail polici thei chosen and the bankrupt philosophi thei embrac for the last three decad __PUNCT__
it a philosophi that sai there no role for govern in make the global economi work for work america __PUNCT__ that we have to just sit back watch those factori close and those job disappear __PUNCT__ that there noth we can do or should do about worker without health care __PUNCT__ or children in crumbl school __PUNCT__ or famili who ar lose their home __PUNCT__ and so we should just hand out a few tax break and wish everyon the best of luck __PUNCT__
ronald reagan call thi trickl __PUNCT__ down econom __PUNCT__
georg bush call it the ownership societi __PUNCT__
but what it realli mean is that you on your own __PUNCT__
if your premium or your tuition is rise faster than you can afford __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
if you that maytag worker who just lost hi pension __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__
if you a child born into poverti __PUNCT__ you just have to pull yourself up by your own bootstrap __PUNCT__
thi philosophi isn't just out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch __PUNCT__ it put our economi out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ whack __PUNCT__
year of pain on main street have final trickl up to wall street and sent us hurtl toward recess __PUNCT__ remind us that we all connect __PUNCT__ that we can't prosper as a nation where a few peopl ar do well and everyon els is struggl __PUNCT__
john mccain is an american hero and a worthi oppon __PUNCT__ but he proven time and time again that he just doesn't understand thi __PUNCT__
it took him three tri in seven dai just to figur out that the home foreclosur crisi wa an actual problem __PUNCT__
he had a front row seat to the last eight year of disastr polici that have widen the incom gap and saddl our children with debt __PUNCT__ and now he promis four more year of the veri same thing __PUNCT__
he promis to make perman the bush tax break for the wealthiest few who didn't need them and didn't ask for them __PUNCT__ tax break that ar so irrespons that john mccain himself onc said thei offend hi conscienc __PUNCT__
he promis four more year of trade deal that don't have a singl safeguard for american worker __PUNCT__ that don't help american worker compet and win in a global economi __PUNCT__
he promis four more year of an administr that will push for the privat of social secur __PUNCT__ a plan that would gambl awai peopl retir on the stock market __PUNCT__ a plan that wa alreadi reject by democrat and republican under georg bush __PUNCT__
he promis four more year of polici that won't guarante health insur for work american __PUNCT__ that won't bring down the rise cost of colleg tuition __PUNCT__ that won't do a thing for the american who ar live in those commun where the job have left and the factori have shut their door __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ despit all thi __PUNCT__ the other side is still bet that the american peopl won't notic that john mccain is run for georg bush third term __PUNCT__
thei think that thei forget about all that happen in the last eight year __PUNCT__ that thei be trick into believ that it either me or our parti is the on that out of touch with what go on in their live __PUNCT__
well i make a differ bet __PUNCT__
i bet on the american peopl __PUNCT__
the men and women i met in small town and big citi across thi countri see thi elect as a defin moment in our histori __PUNCT__
thei understand what at stake here becaus thei live it everi dai __PUNCT__
and thei ar tire of be distract by fake controversi __PUNCT__
thei ar fed up with politician try to divid us for their own polit gain __PUNCT__
and i believ thei see through the tactic that ar us everi year __PUNCT__ in everi elect __PUNCT__ to appeal to our fear __PUNCT__ or our bias __PUNCT__ or our differ __PUNCT__ becaus thei never want or need chang as badli as thei do now __PUNCT__
the peopl i met dure thi campaign know that govern cannot solv all of our problem __PUNCT__ and thei don't expect it to __PUNCT__
thei don't want our tax dollar wast on program that don't work or perk for special interest who don't work for us __PUNCT__
thei understand that we cannot stop everi job from go oversea or build a wall around our economi __PUNCT__ and thei know that we shouldn't __PUNCT__
but thei believ it final time that we make health care afford and avail for everi singl american __PUNCT__ that we bring down cost for worker and for busi __PUNCT__ that we cut premium __PUNCT__ and stop insur compani from deni peopl care or coverag who need it most __PUNCT__
thei believ it time we provid real relief to the victim of thi hous crisi __PUNCT__ that we help famili refin their mortgag so thei can stai in their home __PUNCT__ that we start give tax relief to the peopl who actual need it __PUNCT__ middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__ and senior __PUNCT__ and struggl homeown __PUNCT__
thei believ that we can and should make the global economi work for work american __PUNCT__ that we might not be abl to stop everi job from go oversea __PUNCT__ but we certainli can stop give tax break to compani who send them their and start give tax break to compani who creat good job right here in america __PUNCT__
we can invest in the type of renew energi that won't just reduc our depend on oil and save our planet __PUNCT__ but creat up to five million new job that can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
thei believ we can train our worker for those new job __PUNCT__ and keep the most product workforc the most competit workforc in the world if we fix our public educ system by invest in what work and find out what doesn't __PUNCT__ if we invest in earli childhood educ and final make colleg afford for everyon who want to go __PUNCT__ if we stop talk about how great our teacher ar and start reward them for their great __PUNCT__
thei believ that if you work your entir life __PUNCT__ you deserv to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__ which mean a pension you can count on __PUNCT__ and social secur that alwai there __PUNCT__
thi is what the peopl i met believ about the countri thei love __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter if thei democrat or republican __PUNCT__ whether thei from the smallest town or the biggest citi __PUNCT__ whether thei hunt or thei don't __PUNCT__ whether thei go to church __PUNCT__ or templ __PUNCT__ or mosqu __PUNCT__ or not __PUNCT__
we mai come from differ place and have differ stori __PUNCT__ but we share common hope __PUNCT__ and on veri american dream __PUNCT__
that is the dream i am run to help restor in thi elect __PUNCT__
if i get the chanc __PUNCT__ that is what i be talk about from now until __DATE__ __PUNCT__
that is the choic that i offer the american peopl __PUNCT__ four more year of what we had for the last eight __PUNCT__ or fundament chang in washington __PUNCT__
peopl mai be bitter about their leader and the state of our polit __PUNCT__ but beneath that __PUNCT__ thei ar hope about what possibl in america __PUNCT__
that why thei leav their home on their dai off __PUNCT__ or their job after a long dai of work __PUNCT__ and travel __PUNCT__ sometim for mile __PUNCT__ sometim in the bitter cold __PUNCT__ to attend a ralli or a town hall meet held by senat clinton __PUNCT__ or senat mccain __PUNCT__ or myself __PUNCT__
becaus thei believ that we can chang thing __PUNCT__
becaus thei believ in that dream __PUNCT__
i know someth about that dream __PUNCT__
i wasn't born into a lot of monei __PUNCT__
i wa rais by a singl mother with the help my grandpar __PUNCT__ who grew up in small __PUNCT__ town kansa __PUNCT__ went to school on the gi bill __PUNCT__ and bought their home through an fha loan __PUNCT__
my mother had to us food stamp at on point __PUNCT__ but she still made sure that through scholarship __PUNCT__ i got a chanc to go to some of the best school around __PUNCT__ which help me get into some of the best colleg around __PUNCT__ which gave me loan that michel and i just finish pai not all that mani year ago __PUNCT__
in other word __PUNCT__ my stori is a quintessenti american stori __PUNCT__
