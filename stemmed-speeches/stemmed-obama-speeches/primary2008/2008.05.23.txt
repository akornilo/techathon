it is my privileg to join in thi week independ dai celebr __PUNCT__ and in honor those who have stood up with courag and convict for cuban liberti __PUNCT__
i go to take thi opportun to speak about cuba __PUNCT__ and also u. __PUNCT__ polici toward the america more broadli __PUNCT__
we meet here unit in our unshak commit to freedom __PUNCT__
and it is fit that we reaffirm that commit here in miami __PUNCT__
in mani wai __PUNCT__ miami stand as a symbol of hope for what possibl in the america __PUNCT__
miami promis of liberti and opportun ha drawn gener of immigr to these shore __PUNCT__ sometim with noth more than the cloth on their back __PUNCT__
it wa a similar hope that drew my own father across an ocean __PUNCT__ in search of the same promis that our dream need not be defer becaus of who we ar __PUNCT__ what we look like __PUNCT__ or where we come from __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ in miami __PUNCT__ that promis can join peopl togeth __PUNCT__
we take common pride in a vibrant and divers democraci __PUNCT__ and a hard __PUNCT__ earn prosper __PUNCT__
we find common pleasur in the crack of the bat __PUNCT__ in the rhythm of our music __PUNCT__ and the eas of voic shift from spanish or creol or portugues to english __PUNCT__
these bond ar built on a foundat of share histori in our hemispher __PUNCT__
colon by empir __PUNCT__ we share stori of liber __PUNCT__
confront by our own imperfect __PUNCT__ we ar join in a desir to build a more perfect union __PUNCT__
rich in resourc __PUNCT__ we have yet to vanquish poverti __PUNCT__
what all of us strive for is freedom as fdr describ it __PUNCT__
polit freedom __PUNCT__
religi freedom __PUNCT__
but also freedom from want __PUNCT__ and freedom from fear __PUNCT__
at our best __PUNCT__ the unit state ha been a forc for these four freedom in the america __PUNCT__
but if we honest with ourselv __PUNCT__ we acknowledg that at time we fail to engag the peopl of the region with the respect ow to a partner __PUNCT__
when georg bush wa elect __PUNCT__ he held out the promis that thi would chang __PUNCT__
he rais the hope of the region that our engag would be sustain instead of piecem __PUNCT__
he call mexico our most import bilater relationship __PUNCT__ and pledg to make latin america a __PUNCT__ fundament commit __PUNCT__ of hi presid __PUNCT__
it seem that a new __NUM__ centuri era had dawn __PUNCT__
almost eight year later __PUNCT__ those high hope have been dash __PUNCT__
sinc the bush administr launch a misguid war in iraq __PUNCT__ it polici in the america ha been neglig toward our friend __PUNCT__ ineffect with our adversari __PUNCT__ disinterest in the challeng that matter in peopl __PUNCT__ live __PUNCT__ and incap of advanc our interest in the region __PUNCT__
no wonder __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ that demagogu like hugo chavez have step into thi vacuum __PUNCT__
hi predict yet peril mix of anti __PUNCT__ american rhetor __PUNCT__ authoritarian govern __PUNCT__ and checkbook diplomaci offer the same fals promis as the tri and fail ideolog of the past __PUNCT__
but the unit state is so alien from the rest of the america that thi stale vision ha gone unchalleng __PUNCT__ and ha even made inroad from bolivia to nicaragua __PUNCT__
and chavez and hi alli ar not the onli on fill the vacuum __PUNCT__
while the unit state fail to address the chang realiti in the america __PUNCT__ other from europ and asia __PUNCT__ notabl china __PUNCT__ have step up their own engag __PUNCT__
iran ha drawn closer to venezuela __PUNCT__ and just the other dai tehran and caraca launch a joint bank with their windfal oil profit __PUNCT__
that is the record __PUNCT__ the bush record in latin america __PUNCT__ that john mccain ha chosen to embrac __PUNCT__
senat mccain doesn't talk about these trend in our hemispher becaus he know that it part of the broader bush __PUNCT__ mccain failur to address prioriti beyond iraq __PUNCT__
the situat ha chang in the america __PUNCT__ but we fail to chang with it __PUNCT__
instead of engag the peopl of the region __PUNCT__ we act as if we can still dictat term unilater __PUNCT__
we have not offer a clear and comprehens vision __PUNCT__ back up with strong diplomaci __PUNCT__
we ar fail to join the battl for heart and mind __PUNCT__
for far too long __PUNCT__ washington ha engag in outdat debat and stuck to tire blueprint on drug and trade __PUNCT__ on democraci and develop __PUNCT__ even though thei won't meet the test of the futur __PUNCT__
the stake could not be higher __PUNCT__
it is time for us to recogn that the futur secur and prosper of the unit state is fundament ti to the futur of the america __PUNCT__
if we don't turn awai from the polici of the past __PUNCT__ then we won't be abl to shape the futur __PUNCT__
the bush administr ha offer no clear vision for thi futur __PUNCT__ and neither ha john mccain __PUNCT__
so we face a clear choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can continu as a bystand __PUNCT__ or we can lead the hemispher into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and when i am presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ we will choos to lead __PUNCT__
it time for a new allianc of the america __PUNCT__
after eight year of the fail polici of the past __PUNCT__ we need new leadership for the futur __PUNCT__
after decad press for top __PUNCT__ down reform __PUNCT__ we need an agenda that advanc democraci __PUNCT__ secur __PUNCT__ and opportun from the bottom up __PUNCT__
so my polici toward the america will be guid by the simpl principl that what good for the peopl of the america is good for the unit state __PUNCT__
that mean measur success not just through agreement among govern __PUNCT__ but also through the hope of the child in the favela of rio __PUNCT__ the secur for the policeman in mexico citi __PUNCT__ and the answer cri of polit prison heard from jail in havana __PUNCT__
the first and most fundament freedom that we must work for is polit freedom __PUNCT__
the unit state must be a relentless advoc for democraci __PUNCT__
i grew up for a time in indonesia __PUNCT__
it wa a societi struggl to achiev meaning democraci __PUNCT__
power could be undisguis and indiscrimin __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ power wore a uniform __PUNCT__ and wa unaccount to the peopl __PUNCT__
some still had good reason to fear a knock on the door __PUNCT__
there is no place for thi kind of tyranni in thi hemispher __PUNCT__
there is no place for ani dark that would shut out the light of liberti __PUNCT__
here we must heed the word of dr __PUNCT__ king __PUNCT__ written from hi own jail cell __PUNCT__ injustic anywher is a threat to justic everywher __PUNCT__
throughout my entir life __PUNCT__ there ha been injustic in cuba __PUNCT__
never __PUNCT__ in my lifetim __PUNCT__ have the peopl of cuba known freedom __PUNCT__
never __PUNCT__ in the live of two gener of cuban __PUNCT__ have the peopl of cuba known democraci __PUNCT__
thi is the terribl and tragic statu quo that we have known for half a centuri __PUNCT__ of elect that ar anyth but free or fair __PUNCT__ of dissid lock awai in dark prison cell for the crime of speak the truth __PUNCT__
i won't stand for thi injustic __PUNCT__ you won't stand for thi injustic __PUNCT__ and togeth we will stand up for freedom in cuba __PUNCT__
now i know what the easi thing is to do for american politician __PUNCT__
everi four year __PUNCT__ thei come down to miami __PUNCT__ thei talk tough __PUNCT__ thei go back to washington __PUNCT__ and noth chang in cuba __PUNCT__
that what john mccain did the other dai __PUNCT__
he join the parad of politician who make the same empti promis year after year __PUNCT__ decad after decad __PUNCT__
instead of offer a strategi for chang __PUNCT__ he chose to distort my posit __PUNCT__ embrac georg bush __PUNCT__ and continu a polici that done noth to advanc freedom for the cuban peopl __PUNCT__
that the polit postur that john mccain ha chosen __PUNCT__ and all it show is that you can't take hi so __PUNCT__ call straight talk serious __PUNCT__
my polici toward cuba will be guid by on word __PUNCT__ libertad __PUNCT__
and the road to freedom for all cuban must begin with justic for cuba polit prison __PUNCT__ the right of free speech __PUNCT__ a free press and freedom of assembl __PUNCT__ and it must lead to elect that ar free and fair __PUNCT__
now let me be clear __PUNCT__
john mccain been go around the countri talk about how much i want to meet with raul castro __PUNCT__ as if i look for a social gather __PUNCT__
that never what i said __PUNCT__ and john mccain know it __PUNCT__
after eight year of the disastr polici of georg bush __PUNCT__ it is time to pursu direct diplomaci __PUNCT__ with friend and foe alik __PUNCT__ without precondit __PUNCT__
there will be care prepar __PUNCT__
we will set a clear agenda __PUNCT__
and as presid __PUNCT__ i would be will to lead that diplomaci at a time and place of my choos __PUNCT__ but onli when we have an opportun to advanc the interest of the unit state __PUNCT__ and to advanc the caus of freedom for the cuban peopl __PUNCT__
i will never __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__ compromis the caus of liberti __PUNCT__
and unlik john mccain __PUNCT__ i would never __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__ rule out a cours of action that could advanc the caus of liberti __PUNCT__
we heard enough empti promis from politician like georg bush and john mccain __PUNCT__
i will turn the page __PUNCT__
it time for more than tough talk that never yield result __PUNCT__
it time for a new strategi __PUNCT__
there ar no better ambassador for freedom than cuban american __PUNCT__
that why i will immedi allow unlimit famili travel and remitt to the island __PUNCT__
it time to let cuban american see their mother and father __PUNCT__ their sister and brother __PUNCT__
it time to let cuban american monei make their famili less depend upon the castro regim __PUNCT__
i will maintain the embargo __PUNCT__
it provid us with the leverag to present the regim with a clear choic __PUNCT__ if you take signific step toward democraci __PUNCT__ begin with the free of all polit prison __PUNCT__ we will take step to begin normal relat __PUNCT__
that the wai to bring about real chang in cuba __PUNCT__ through strong __PUNCT__ smart and principl diplomaci __PUNCT__
and we know that freedom across our hemispher must go beyond elect __PUNCT__
in venezuela __PUNCT__ hugo chavez is a democrat elect leader __PUNCT__
but we also know that he doe not govern democrat __PUNCT__
he talk of the peopl __PUNCT__ but hi action just serv hi own power __PUNCT__
yet the bush administr blusteri condemn and clumsi attempt to undermin chavez have onli strengthen hi hand __PUNCT__
we heard plenti of talk about democraci from georg bush __PUNCT__ but we need steadi action __PUNCT__
we must put forward a vision of democraci that goe beyond the ballot box __PUNCT__
we should increas our support for strong legislatur __PUNCT__ independ judiciari __PUNCT__ free press __PUNCT__ vibrant civil societi __PUNCT__ honest polic forc __PUNCT__ religi freedom __PUNCT__ and the rule of law __PUNCT__
that is how we can support democraci that is strong and sustain not just on an elect dai __PUNCT__ but in the dai to dai live of the peopl of the america __PUNCT__
that is what is so badli need __PUNCT__ not just in cuba and venezuela __PUNCT__ but just to our southeast in haiti as well __PUNCT__
the haitian peopl have suffer too long under govern that care more about their own power than their peopl __PUNCT__ progress and prosper __PUNCT__
it time to press haiti leader to bridg the divid between them __PUNCT__
and it time to invest in the econom develop that must underpin the secur that the haitian peopl lack __PUNCT__
and that is why the second part of my agenda will be advanc freedom from fear in the america __PUNCT__
for too mani peopl in our hemispher __PUNCT__ secur is absent from their daili live __PUNCT__
and for far too long __PUNCT__ washington ha been trap in a convent think about latin america and the caribbean __PUNCT__
from the right __PUNCT__ we hear about violent insurg __PUNCT__
from the left __PUNCT__ we hear about paramilitari __PUNCT__
thi is the predict debat that seem frozen in time from the 1980 __PUNCT__
you either soft on commun or soft on death squad __PUNCT__
and it ha more to do with the polit of washington than beat back the peril that so mani peopl face in the america __PUNCT__
the person live in fear of violenc doesn't care if thei threaten by a right __PUNCT__ wing paramilitari or a left __PUNCT__ wing terrorist __PUNCT__ thei don't care if thei be threaten by a drug cartel or a corrupt polic forc __PUNCT__
thei just care that thei be threaten __PUNCT__ and that their famili can't live and work in peac __PUNCT__
that is why there will never be true secur unless we focu our effort on target everi sourc of fear in the america __PUNCT__
that what i do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
for the peopl of colombia __PUNCT__ who have suffer at the hand of killer of everi sort __PUNCT__ that mean battl all sourc of violenc __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will continu the andean counter __PUNCT__ drug program __PUNCT__ and updat it to meet evolv challeng __PUNCT__
we will fulli support colombia fight against the farc __PUNCT__
we work with the govern to end the reign of terror from right wing paramilitari __PUNCT__
we will support colombia right to strike terrorist who seek safe __PUNCT__ haven across it border __PUNCT__
and we will shine a light on ani support for the farc that come from neighbor govern __PUNCT__
thi behavior must be expos to intern condemn __PUNCT__ region isol __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ if need be __PUNCT__ strong sanction __PUNCT__
it must not stand __PUNCT__
we must also make clear our support for labor right __PUNCT__ and human right __PUNCT__ and that mean meaning support for colombia democrat institut __PUNCT__
we neglect thi support __PUNCT__ especi for the rule of law __PUNCT__ for far too long __PUNCT__
in everi countri in our hemispher __PUNCT__ includ our own __PUNCT__ govern must develop the tool to protect their peopl __PUNCT__
becaus if we learn anyth in our histori in the america __PUNCT__ it that true secur cannot come from forc alon __PUNCT__
not as long as there ar town in mexico where drug kingpin ar more power than judg __PUNCT__
not as long as there ar children who grow up afraid of the polic __PUNCT__
not as long as drug and gang move north across our border __PUNCT__ while gun and cash move south in return __PUNCT__
thi nexu is a danger to everi countri in the region __PUNCT__ includ our own __PUNCT__
thousand of central american gang member have been arrest across the unit state __PUNCT__ includ here in south florida __PUNCT__
there ar nation emerg face guatemala __PUNCT__ el salvador __PUNCT__ and hondura __PUNCT__
mexican drug cartel ar terror citi and town __PUNCT__
presid calderon wa right to sai that enough is enough __PUNCT__
we must support mexico effort to crack down __PUNCT__
but we must stand for more than forc __PUNCT__ we must support the rule of law from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that mean more invest in prevent and prosecutor __PUNCT__ in commun polic and an independ judiciari __PUNCT__
i agre with my friend __PUNCT__ senat dick lugar __PUNCT__ the merida initi doe not invest enough in central america __PUNCT__ where much of the traffick and gang activ begin __PUNCT__
and we must press further south as well __PUNCT__
it time to work togeth to find the best practic that work across the hemispher __PUNCT__ and to tailor approach to fit each countri __PUNCT__
that why i will direct my attornei gener and secretari of homeland secur to sit down with all their counterpart in the america dure my first year in offic __PUNCT__
we strive for uniti of effort __PUNCT__
we provid the resourc __PUNCT__ and ask that everi countri do the same __PUNCT__
and we tie our support to clear benchmark for drug seizur __PUNCT__ corrupt prosecut __PUNCT__ crime reduct __PUNCT__ and kingpin bust __PUNCT__
we have to do our part __PUNCT__
and that is why a core part of thi effort will be a northbound __PUNCT__ southbound strategi __PUNCT__
we need tougher border secur __PUNCT__ and a renew focu on bust up gang and traffick cross our border __PUNCT__
but we must address the materi head south as well __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i make it clear that we come after the gun __PUNCT__ we come after the monei launder __PUNCT__ and we come after the vehicl that enabl thi crime __PUNCT__
and we crack down on the demand for drug in our own commun __PUNCT__ and restor fund for drug task forc and the cop program __PUNCT__
we must win the fight on our own street if we go to secur the region __PUNCT__
the third part of my agenda is advanc freedom from want __PUNCT__ becaus there is much that we can do to advanc opportun for the peopl of the america __PUNCT__
that begin with understand what chang in latin america __PUNCT__ and what hasn't __PUNCT__
enorm wealth ha been creat __PUNCT__ and financi market ar far stronger than a decad ago __PUNCT__
brazil economi ha grown by leap and bound __PUNCT__ and perhap the second richest person in the world is a mexican __PUNCT__
yet while there ha been great econom progress __PUNCT__ there is still back __PUNCT__ break inequ __PUNCT__
despit a grow middl class __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million peopl live on less than two dollar a dai __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ percent of latin american live in poverti __PUNCT__
thi feed everyth from drug __PUNCT__ to migrat __PUNCT__ to support for leader that appeal to the poor without deliv on their promis __PUNCT__
that is why the unit state must stand for growth in the america from the bottom up __PUNCT__
that begin at home __PUNCT__ with comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__
that mean secur our border and pass tough employ enforc law __PUNCT__
it mean bring __NUM__ million unauthor immigr out of the shadow __PUNCT__
but it also mean work with mexico __PUNCT__ central america and other to support bottom up develop to our south __PUNCT__
for two hundr year __PUNCT__ the unit state ha made it clear that we won't stand for foreign intervent in our hemispher __PUNCT__
but everi dai __PUNCT__ all across the america __PUNCT__ there is a differ kind of struggl __PUNCT__ not against foreign armi __PUNCT__ but against the deadli threat of hunger and thirst __PUNCT__ diseas and despair __PUNCT__
that is not a futur that we have to accept __PUNCT__ not for the child in port au princ or the famili in the highland of peru __PUNCT__
we can do better __PUNCT__
we must do better __PUNCT__
we cannot ignor suffer to our south __PUNCT__ nor stand for the global of the empti stomach __PUNCT__
respons rest with govern in the region __PUNCT__ but we must do our part __PUNCT__
i will substanti increas our aid to the america __PUNCT__ and embrac the millennium develop goal of halv global poverti by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we target support to bottom __PUNCT__ up growth through micro financ __PUNCT__ vocat train __PUNCT__ and small enterpris develop __PUNCT__
it time for the unit state to onc again be a beacon of hope and a help hand __PUNCT__
trade must be part of thi solut __PUNCT__
but i strongli reject the bush __PUNCT__ mccain view that ani trade deal is a good deal __PUNCT__
we cannot accept trade that enrich those at the top of the ladder while cut out the rung at the bottom __PUNCT__
it time to understand that the goal of our trade polici must be trade that work for all peopl in all countri __PUNCT__
like central america bishop __PUNCT__ i oppos cafta becaus the need of worker were not adequ address __PUNCT__
i support the peru free trade agreement becaus there were bind labor and environment provis __PUNCT__
that the kind of trade we need __PUNCT__ trade that lift up worker __PUNCT__ not just a corpor bottom line __PUNCT__
there noth protectionist about demand that trade spread the benefit of global __PUNCT__ instead of steer them to special interest while we short __PUNCT__ chang worker at home and abroad __PUNCT__
if john mccain believ __PUNCT__ as he said the other dai __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ percent of american think we on the wrong track becaus we haven't pass free trade with colombia __PUNCT__ then he total out of touch with the american peopl __PUNCT__
and if john mccain think that we can paper over our failur of leadership in the region by occasion pass trade deal with friendli govern __PUNCT__ then he out of touch with the peopl of the america __PUNCT__
and we have to look for wai to grow our economi and deepen integr beyond trade deal __PUNCT__
that what china is do right now __PUNCT__ as thei build bridg from beij to brazil __PUNCT__ and expand their invest across the region __PUNCT__
if the unit state doe not step forward __PUNCT__ we risk be left behind __PUNCT__
and that is why we must seiz a uniqu opportun to lead the region toward a more secur and sustain energi futur __PUNCT__
all of us feel the impact of the global energi crisi __PUNCT__
in the short __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ it mean an ever __PUNCT__ more expens addict to oil __PUNCT__ which bankrol petro __PUNCT__ power authoritarian around the globe __PUNCT__ and drive up the cost of everyth from a tank of ga to dinner on the tabl __PUNCT__
and in the long __PUNCT__ term __PUNCT__ few region ar more imperil by the stronger storm __PUNCT__ higher floodwat __PUNCT__ and devast drought that could come with global warm __PUNCT__
whole crop could disappear __PUNCT__ put the food suppli at risk for hundr of million __PUNCT__
while we share thi risk __PUNCT__ we also share the resourc to do someth about it __PUNCT__
that why i bring togeth the countri of the region in a new energi partnership for the america __PUNCT__
we need to go beyond bilater agreement __PUNCT__
we need a region approach __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can forg a path toward sustain growth and clean energi __PUNCT__
leadership must begin at home __PUNCT__
that why i propos a cap and trade system to limit our carbon emiss and to invest in altern sourc of energi __PUNCT__
we allow industri emitt to offset a portion of thi cost by invest in low carbon energi project in latin america and the caribbean __PUNCT__
and we increas research and develop across the america in clean coal technolog __PUNCT__ in the next gener of sustain biofuel not taken from food crop __PUNCT__ and in wind and solar energi __PUNCT__
we enlist the world bank __PUNCT__ the organ of american state __PUNCT__ and the inter __PUNCT__ american develop bank to support these invest __PUNCT__ and ensur that these project enhanc natur resourc like land __PUNCT__ wildlif __PUNCT__ and rain forest __PUNCT__
we final enforc environment standard in our trade deal __PUNCT__
we establish a program for the depart of energi and our laboratori to share technolog with countri across the region __PUNCT__
we assess the opportun and risk of nuclear power in the hemispher by sit down with mexico __PUNCT__ brazil __PUNCT__ argentina and chile __PUNCT__
and we call on the american peopl to join thi effort through an energi corp of engin and scientist who will go abroad to help develop clean energi solut __PUNCT__
thi is the uniqu role that the unit state can plai __PUNCT__
we can offer more than the tyranni of oil __PUNCT__
we can learn from the progress made in a countri like brazil __PUNCT__ while make the america a model for the world __PUNCT__
we can offer leadership that serv the common prosper and common secur of the entir region __PUNCT__
thi is the promis of fdr four freedom that we must realiz __PUNCT__
but onli if we recogn that in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we cannot treat latin america and the caribbean as a junior partner __PUNCT__ just as our neighbor to the south should reject the bombast of authoritarian bulli __PUNCT__
an allianc of the america will onli succe if it is found on a bedrock of mutual respect __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on the arrog in washington and the anti __PUNCT__ american across the region that stand in the wai of progress __PUNCT__
it time to listen to on anoth and to learn from on anoth __PUNCT__
to fulfil thi promis __PUNCT__ my administr won't wait six year to proclaim a __PUNCT__ year of engag __PUNCT__
we will pursu aggress __PUNCT__ principl __PUNCT__ and sustain diplomaci in the america from dai on __PUNCT__
i will reinstat a special envoi for the america in my white hous who will work with my full support __PUNCT__
but we also expand the foreign servic __PUNCT__ and open more consul in the neglect region of the america __PUNCT__
we expand the peac corp __PUNCT__ and ask more young american to go abroad to deepen the trust and the ti among our peopl __PUNCT__
and we must tap the vast resourc of our own immigr popul to advanc each part of our agenda __PUNCT__
on of the troubl aspect of our recent polit ha been the anti __PUNCT__ immigr sentiment that ha flare up __PUNCT__ and been exploit by politician come elect time __PUNCT__
we need to understand that immigr __PUNCT__ when done legal __PUNCT__ is a sourc of strength for thi countri __PUNCT__
our divers is a sourc of strength for thi countri __PUNCT__
when we join togeth __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ and nativ american __PUNCT__ there is noth that we can't accomplish __PUNCT__
todo somo americano __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can choos the futur over the past __PUNCT__
at a time when our leadership ha suffer __PUNCT__ i have no doubt about whether we can succe __PUNCT__
if the unit state make it case __PUNCT__ if we meet those who doubt us or derid us head __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ if we draw on our best tradit of stand up for those four freedom __PUNCT__ then we can shape our futur instead of be shape by it __PUNCT__
we can renew our leadership in the hemispher __PUNCT__
we can win the support not just of govern __PUNCT__ but of the peopl of the america __PUNCT__
but onli if we leav the bluster behind __PUNCT__
onli if we ar strong and steadfast __PUNCT__ confid and consist __PUNCT__
jose marti onc wrote __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it is not enough to come to the defens of freedom with epic and intermitt effort when it is threaten at moment that appear critic __PUNCT__
everi moment is critic for the defens of freedom __PUNCT__
everi moment is critic __PUNCT__
and thi must be our moment __PUNCT__
freedom __PUNCT__
opportun __PUNCT__
digniti __PUNCT__
these ar not just the valu of the unit state __PUNCT__ thei ar the valu of the america __PUNCT__
thei were the caus of washington infantri and bolivar cavalri __PUNCT__ of marti pen and hidalgo church bell __PUNCT__
that legaci is our inherit __PUNCT__
that must be our caus __PUNCT__
and now must be the time that we turn the page to a new chapter in the stori of the america __PUNCT__
