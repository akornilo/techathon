it great to be back in oregon __PUNCT__
over the last fifteen month __PUNCT__ we travel to everi corner of the unit state __PUNCT__
now i know that if you listen to washington or pai attent to the pundit __PUNCT__ you hear a lot about how divid we ar as a peopl __PUNCT__
but that not what i found as i travel across thi great countri __PUNCT__
everywher i go __PUNCT__ i been impress by the valu and hope that we share __PUNCT__
in big citi and small town __PUNCT__ among men and women __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ and brown __PUNCT__ american share a faith in simpl dream __PUNCT__
a job with wage that can support a famili __PUNCT__
health care that we can count on and afford __PUNCT__
a retir that is dignifi and secur __PUNCT__
educ and opportun for our kid __PUNCT__
common hope __PUNCT__
american dream __PUNCT__
that why thi elect is so import __PUNCT__
becaus for far too mani american __PUNCT__ those hope and dream ar slip awai __PUNCT__
we just came through the first period of sustain econom growth sinc world war ii that saw incom drop __PUNCT__
peopl ar work harder for less __PUNCT__
you pai more for ga __PUNCT__ and groceri __PUNCT__ and tuition __PUNCT__
million of famili ar face foreclosur __PUNCT__
we alreadi lost hundr of thousand of job thi year __PUNCT__
to be sure __PUNCT__ some of these problem ar a result of chang in our economi that no on can control __PUNCT__
but instead of help __PUNCT__ washington polici have made it wors __PUNCT__
instead of expand opportun for work peopl __PUNCT__ we tri to grow our economi from the top down __PUNCT__ and eventu that pain trickl up __PUNCT__
instead of make sure that peopl can live their dream on main street __PUNCT__ we tilt the scale for special interest and wall street __PUNCT__
instead of sai __PUNCT__ we all in thi togeth __PUNCT__ as american __PUNCT__ washington ha sent a messag that sai __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
john mccain ha serv hi countri with honor __PUNCT__ and i respect that servic __PUNCT__
but it wa dead wrong when he said recent that he think our economi ha made __PUNCT__ great progress __PUNCT__ under georg bush __PUNCT__
is there anyon outsid of washington d.c __PUNCT__ who could truli believ that __PUNCT__ do you __PUNCT__ senat mccain is run for presid to doubl down on georg bush fail polici __PUNCT__
i am run to chang them __PUNCT__ and that will be the fundament differ in thi elect when i am the democrat nomine for presid __PUNCT__
we have a differ on tax __PUNCT__
john mccain want to continu georg bush tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ i want to give a tax cut to work peopl __PUNCT__
i admir senat mccain when he said he could not __PUNCT__ in good conscienc __PUNCT__ support the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
but now __PUNCT__ as the republican nomine __PUNCT__ he fulli embrac them __PUNCT__
he want to give a perman tax cut to the wealthiest american who don't need them and didn't ask for them while work peopl ar struggl __PUNCT__
and for all hi talk about fiscal respons __PUNCT__ he propos __MONEY__ billion in tax cut without ani word about how he pai for him __PUNCT__
that exactli the kind of attitud that ha shift the burden on to the middl class __PUNCT__ and mortgag our children futur on a mountain of debt __PUNCT__
i think it time to restor fair and respons to our tax code __PUNCT__
we need to reward work __PUNCT__ not just wealth __PUNCT__
we need to stop give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and put a tax cut in the pocket of middl class american __PUNCT__
that why i propos a __PUNCT__ make work pai __PUNCT__ tax credit of up to __MONEY__ for worker __PUNCT__ and __MONEY__ for work famili __PUNCT__
thi will cut tax for __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__
it will help you deal with rise cost __PUNCT__ and give our economi a boost by eas the burden on main street __PUNCT__
we have a differ on health care __PUNCT__
john mccain want to continu a georg bush approach that onli take care of the healthi and the wealthi __PUNCT__ that allow insur compani to discrimin and deni coverag to those american who need it most __PUNCT__
thi is exactli the kind of approach that ha left out ten of million of american __PUNCT__
it why you ar struggl with rise cost __PUNCT__
and it why we have fail to solv our health care crisi year after year after year __PUNCT__
i think it time to final make health care afford and access for everi american __PUNCT__
we need to stand up to the insur compani and the drug compani __PUNCT__
we need to bring american togeth __PUNCT__
and we need to pass a plan that lower everi famili premium __PUNCT__ and give everi uninsur american the same kind of coverag that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
we have a differ on ga price __PUNCT__
john mccain ha embrac a ga tax gimmick that __PUNCT__ when it said and done __PUNCT__ will save you less than thirti dollar thi summer __PUNCT__
thi is a classic washington fix that more about get john mccain through an elect than solv your problem __PUNCT__
it will put more monei in the pocket of the oil compani __PUNCT__
it bad for our environ __PUNCT__
and it won't bring own ga price over the long term __PUNCT__ most economist think it will send those price up __PUNCT__
i believ we ow the american peopl the truth __PUNCT__
that why my plan to lower ga price rais fuel effici standard on car __PUNCT__ invest in altern energi to end our addict to oil __PUNCT__ and creat million of new green job while save our planet in the bargain __PUNCT__
that the kind of chang we need in washington __PUNCT__
we have a fundament differ on our prioriti for the presid __PUNCT__
john mccain want to continu georg bush war in iraq __PUNCT__ lose thousand of live and spend ten of billion of dollar a month to fight a war that isn't make us safer __PUNCT__
i want to end thi war __PUNCT__
i want to invest that monei in america __PUNCT__ in our road and bridg and port __PUNCT__
and i want to invest in million of green job __PUNCT__ so that we final develop renew energi __PUNCT__ end our addict to oil __PUNCT__ bring those ga price down __PUNCT__ and save our planet in the bargain __PUNCT__
there will be real differ on the ballot in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
and that what elect should be about __PUNCT__
john mccain will stand with washington tri and fail approach of the past __PUNCT__ i will stand with the american peopl on behalf of a new direct for work peopl __PUNCT__
becaus i believ it time for america to onc again be a place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
i believ it time for washington to work for your hope __PUNCT__ for your dream __PUNCT__
that the choic i offer in thi campaign __PUNCT__
and that what i do everi dai as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
