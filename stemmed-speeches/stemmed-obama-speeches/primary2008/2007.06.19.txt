it ha now been a littl over four month sinc we began thi campaign __PUNCT__
and everywher we been __PUNCT__ whether it oakland or cleveland __PUNCT__ atlanta or austin __PUNCT__ we been get these inspir __PUNCT__ humbl crowd of thousand __PUNCT__
for a lot of peopl __PUNCT__ it the first polit event of their lifetim __PUNCT__
i like to take all the credit myself __PUNCT__ but i know that not the onli reason thei come __PUNCT__
there is a hunger in thi countri right now __PUNCT__ a long for someth new that we haven't seen in year __PUNCT__
and whenev i stop and think about it __PUNCT__ i remind of what got me into public servic in the first place __PUNCT__
the year after colleg __PUNCT__ i decid to move to chicago __PUNCT__
it wa a time where factori close were sweep the midwest __PUNCT__ and thousand were be laid off __PUNCT__ and thei were board up home and busi __PUNCT__
on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ where neighborhood were struggl to rebuild after the close of nearbi steel plant __PUNCT__ a group of church came togeth and decid that thei could make a differ __PUNCT__
and thei hire me to help __PUNCT__
the salari wa __MONEY__ a year plu enough monei to bui an old __PUNCT__ beat __PUNCT__ up car __PUNCT__ so i took the job and becam a commun organ __PUNCT__
we went to work set up job train program for the unemploi and after school program for kid __PUNCT__
and block by block __PUNCT__ we turn those neighborhood around __PUNCT__
it wa the best educ i ever had __PUNCT__ becaus i learn in those neighborhood that when ordinari peopl come togeth __PUNCT__ thei can achiev extraordinari thing __PUNCT__
and so later __PUNCT__ when i finish law school __PUNCT__ i turn down the corpor job offer and i came back to chicago to continu the work i start __PUNCT__
i organ a voter registr drive that sign up __NUM__ new voter to help elect bill clinton in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i join a civil right law practic __PUNCT__ and i start teach constitut law __PUNCT__ becaus unlik some occup of the white hous __PUNCT__ i actual believ in the constitut __PUNCT__
and after a few year __PUNCT__ peopl start come up to me and tell me i should run for state senat __PUNCT__
so i jump in the race __PUNCT__
and i shook everi hand i could and pass out flyer to whoever would take them __PUNCT__
but the on question i get from peopl more than ani other wa __PUNCT__ you seem like a nice young man __PUNCT__
you done all thi great work __PUNCT__
you been a commun organ __PUNCT__ and you teach law school __PUNCT__ you a civil right attornei __PUNCT__ you a famili man __PUNCT__ why would you wanna go into someth dirti and nasti like polit __PUNCT__
and i understand the question __PUNCT__ and the cynic __PUNCT__
we all understand it __PUNCT__
we understand it becaus we all seen that polit in thi town is no longer a mission __PUNCT__ it a busi __PUNCT__
our polit ha never been pure __PUNCT__ but there a sens that in the last sever year __PUNCT__ the race for monei __PUNCT__ and influenc __PUNCT__ and power ha left the hope and concern of most american in the dust __PUNCT__
you worri about how you pai for colleg __PUNCT__ or health care __PUNCT__ or save for retir __PUNCT__ but when you turn on the tv or open the newspap __PUNCT__ all you see from washington is anoth scandal __PUNCT__ or a petti argument __PUNCT__ or the persist stubborn of a presid who refus to end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__
as the rest of us have turn awai from thi kind of polit in cynic and frustrat __PUNCT__ we know what fill the void __PUNCT__
the lobbyist and influenc __PUNCT__ peddler with the cash and the connect __PUNCT__ the on who turn govern into a game onli thei can afford to plai __PUNCT__
it the pharmaceut compani that get to write our drug bill while the price of prescript skyrocket for the rest of us __PUNCT__
it the oil lobbyist that get to meet with the same white hous that silenc the scientist who warn us about the destruct of our planet __PUNCT__
you know who i talk about here __PUNCT__
thei write the check and you get stuck with the bill __PUNCT__ thei get the access while you get to write a letter __PUNCT__ thei think thei own thi govern __PUNCT__ but we here to tell them it not for sale __PUNCT__
peopl tell me i haven't spent a lot of time learn the wai of washington __PUNCT__
but i promis you thi __PUNCT__ i been here long enough to know that the wai of washington must chang __PUNCT__
the cynic we feel about what polit can achiev todai is no accid __PUNCT__
it ha to do with a failur of leadership __PUNCT__
it ha to do with the philosophi thei peddl in thi town for the last six year __PUNCT__ a philosophi of trickl __PUNCT__ down and on __PUNCT__ your __PUNCT__ own that sai govern ha no role in solv the challeng we face and so it shouldn't even try __PUNCT__
it a theori that easi to talk about when you plai polit in washington __PUNCT__ but harder to defend when you actual see what it doe to averag american __PUNCT__
i met a famili in iowa citi with a small busi of fifteen year who is now face bankruptci becaus of their medic bill __PUNCT__
try tell them thei on their own __PUNCT__
i spoke with worker in newton who were watch their maytag plant close down and their shop get ship oversea __PUNCT__
try tell them to pull themselv up by their bootstrap __PUNCT__
try sai __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ to the famili who still don't have home in new orlean __PUNCT__ or the __NUM__ million american without health care __PUNCT__ or the __NUM__ million children born into poverti in the richest nation on earth __PUNCT__
thi is not who we ar __PUNCT__
thi is not how america ha persev through war and depress __PUNCT__ through struggl for civil right and women right and worker right __PUNCT__
we have come thi far as a nation becaus we believ in a differ kind of polit __PUNCT__ becaus we believ in a differ vision for america __PUNCT__
we believ that we rise or fall as on peopl __PUNCT__
we believ that we each have a stake in on anoth __PUNCT__ that i am my brother keeper __PUNCT__ that i am my sister keeper __PUNCT__
we believ that what happen to that famili in iowa __PUNCT__ or to those maytag worker __PUNCT__ that matter to us __PUNCT__ even if it not our famili __PUNCT__ or our job __PUNCT__
and what more __PUNCT__ in the face of our cynic __PUNCT__ and our doubt __PUNCT__ and the power and influenc we see in washington __PUNCT__ we believ that thi kind of america is possibl __PUNCT__
the time for the can't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ even __PUNCT__ try style of polit is over __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
some of our more cynic friend in the media teas me from time to time for alwai talk about hope __PUNCT__
but the reason i do is becaus i seen it power __PUNCT__
no on thought those south side neighborhood had a chanc when i got there __PUNCT__
but we band togeth __PUNCT__ and we kept work __PUNCT__ and we taught peopl to stand up to their govern when it wasn't stand up for them __PUNCT__
when i got to the illinoi state senat __PUNCT__ peopl said it wa too hard to take on the issu of monei in polit __PUNCT__ that our state had too long a histori __PUNCT__ and too mani entrench interest __PUNCT__
but i knew we had the peopl of illinoi on our side __PUNCT__ and i even found a few folk on the other side of the aisl who were will to listen __PUNCT__ and we pass the first major ethic reform in twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__
peopl told me i couldn't reform a death penalti system that had sent __NUM__ innoc peopl to death row __PUNCT__
but we did that __PUNCT__
thei doubt whether we could put govern back on the side of averag peopl __PUNCT__ but we put tax cut in the pocket of the work famili who need them instead of the folk who didn't __PUNCT__
and i pass health care reform that insur anoth __NUM__ children and parent __PUNCT__
so i know that chang is possibl __PUNCT__
i know that turn the page is possibl __PUNCT__
thi isn't just the rhetor of a campaign __PUNCT__ it been the caus of my life __PUNCT__ a caus i will work for and fight for everi dai as your presid __PUNCT__
it not enough just to chang parti in thi elect __PUNCT__
if we hope to truli transform thi countri __PUNCT__ we have to chang our polit too __PUNCT__

it time to treat teach like the profess it is __PUNCT__
it time to pai our teacher what thei deserv __PUNCT__
and when it come to develop the high standard we need __PUNCT__ it time to stop work against our teacher and start work with them __PUNCT__

thi will gener million of dollar to invest in renew sourc of energi and creat new job and even a new industri in the process __PUNCT__
