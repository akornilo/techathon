it ha now been a littl over two month sinc we began thi campaign __PUNCT__
in that time we have travel all across thi countri __PUNCT__
and befor everi event we do __PUNCT__ i usual have a minut to sit quietli and collect my thought __PUNCT__
and recent __PUNCT__ i found myself reflect on what it wa that led me to public servic in the first place __PUNCT__
i live in chicago now __PUNCT__ but i am not a nativ of that great citi __PUNCT__
i move there when i wa just a year out of colleg __PUNCT__ and a group of church offer me a job as a commun organ so i could help rebuild neighborhood that had been devast by the close of steel plant __PUNCT__
the salari wa __MONEY__ a year plu enough monei to bui an old __PUNCT__ beat __PUNCT__ up car __PUNCT__ and so i took the job and drove out to chicago __PUNCT__ where i didn't know a soul __PUNCT__
and dure the time i wa there __PUNCT__ we work to set up job train program for the unemploi and after school program for kid __PUNCT__
and it wa the best educ i ever had __PUNCT__ becaus i learn in those neighborhood that when ordinari peopl come togeth __PUNCT__ thei can achiev extraordinari thing __PUNCT__
after three year __PUNCT__ i went back to law school __PUNCT__
i left there with a degre and a lifetim of debt __PUNCT__ but i turn down the corpor job offer so i could come back to chicago and organ a voter registr drive __PUNCT__
i also start a civil right practic __PUNCT__ and began to teach constitut law __PUNCT__
and after a few year __PUNCT__ peopl start come up to me and tell me i should run for state senat __PUNCT__
so i did what everi man doe when he face with a big decis __PUNCT__ i prai __PUNCT__ and i ask my wife __PUNCT__
and after consult those two higher power __PUNCT__ i decid to get in the race __PUNCT__
and everywher i go __PUNCT__ i get two question __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ thei ask __PUNCT__ where you get that funni name __PUNCT__ barack obama __PUNCT__ becaus peopl just couldn't pronounc it __PUNCT__
thei call me __PUNCT__ alabama __PUNCT__ or thei call me __PUNCT__ yo mama __PUNCT__
and i tell them that my father wa from kenya __PUNCT__ and that where i got my name __PUNCT__
and my mother wa from kansa __PUNCT__ and that where i got my accent from __PUNCT__
and the second thing peopl would ask me wa __PUNCT__ you seem like a nice young man __PUNCT__
you done all thi great work __PUNCT__
you been a commun organ __PUNCT__ and you teach law school __PUNCT__ you a civil right attornei __PUNCT__ you a famili man __PUNCT__ why would you wanna go into someth dirti and nasti like polit __PUNCT__
and i understand the question __PUNCT__ and the cynic __PUNCT__
we all understand it __PUNCT__
we understand it becaus we get the sens todai that polit ha becom a busi and not a mission __PUNCT__
in the last sever year __PUNCT__ we have seen washington becom a place where keep score of who up and who down is more import than who work on behalf of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we have been told that our mount debt don't matter __PUNCT__ that the economi is do great __PUNCT__ and so american should be left to face their anxieti about rise health care cost and disappear pension on their own __PUNCT__
we been told that climat chang is a hoax __PUNCT__ that our broken school cannot be fix __PUNCT__ that we ar destin to send million of dollar a dai to mideast dictat for their oil __PUNCT__
and we seen how a foreign polici base on bluster and bombast can lead us into a war that should never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
and when we try to have an honest debat about the crise we face __PUNCT__ whether it on the senat floor or a sundai talk show __PUNCT__ the convers isn't about find common ground __PUNCT__ it about find someon to blame __PUNCT__
we divid into red state and blue state __PUNCT__ and told to alwai point the finger at somebodi els __PUNCT__ the other parti __PUNCT__ or gai peopl __PUNCT__ or immigr __PUNCT__
for good reason __PUNCT__ the rest of us have becom cynic about what polit can achiev in thi countri __PUNCT__ and as we turn awai in frustrat __PUNCT__ we know what fill the void __PUNCT__
the lobbyist and influenc __PUNCT__ peddler with the cash and the connect __PUNCT__ the on who turn govern into a game onli thei can afford to plai __PUNCT__
thei write the check and you get stuck with the bill __PUNCT__ thei get the access while you get to write a letter __PUNCT__ thei think thei own thi govern __PUNCT__ but we here to tell them it not for sale __PUNCT__
peopl tell me i haven't spent a lot of time learn the wai of washington __PUNCT__
but i promis you thi __PUNCT__ i been there long enough to know that the wai of washington must chang __PUNCT__
i run for presid becaus the time for the can't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ even __PUNCT__ try style of polit is over __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
there is an awaken take place in america todai __PUNCT__
from new hampshir to california __PUNCT__ from texa to iowa __PUNCT__ we ar see crowd we never seen befor __PUNCT__ we see peopl show up to the veri first polit event of their live __PUNCT__
thei come becaus thei know we ar at a crossroad right now __PUNCT__
becaus we ar face a set of challeng we haven't seen in a gener __PUNCT__ and if we don't meet those challeng __PUNCT__ we could end up leav our children a world that a littl poorer and a littl meaner than we found it __PUNCT__
and so the american peopl ar hungri for a differ kind of polit __PUNCT__ the kind of polit base on the ideal thi countri wa found upon __PUNCT__
the idea that we ar all connect as on peopl __PUNCT__
that we all have a stake in on anoth __PUNCT__
it what i learn as a state senat in illinoi __PUNCT__
that you can turn the page on old debat __PUNCT__ that it possibl to compromis so long as you as you never compromis your principl __PUNCT__ and that so long as we will to listen to each other __PUNCT__ we can assum the best in peopl instead of the worst __PUNCT__
that how we were abl to reform a death penalti system that sent __NUM__ innoc peopl to death row __PUNCT__
that how we were abl to give health insur to __NUM__ more children who need it __PUNCT__
that how we gave __MONEY__ million worth of tax cut to work famili in illinoi __PUNCT__
and that how we pass the first ethic reform in twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__
we have seen too mani campaign where our problem ar talk to death __PUNCT__
where ten __PUNCT__ point plan ar crush under the weight of the same old polit onc the elect over __PUNCT__
where experi in washington doesn't alwai translat to result for the american peopl __PUNCT__
and so if we do not chang our polit __PUNCT__ if we do not fundament chang the wai washington work __PUNCT__ then the problem we been talk about for the last gener will be the same on that haunt us for gener to come __PUNCT__
we must find a wai to come togeth in thi countri __PUNCT__ to realiz that the respons we have to on anoth as american is greater than the pursuit of ani ideolog agenda or corpor bottom line __PUNCT__
democrat of california __PUNCT__ it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on health care __PUNCT__ to bring togeth union and busi __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ and to let the insur and drug compani know that while thei get a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__ thei don't get to bui everi chair __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will sign a univers health care law by the end of my first term __PUNCT__
my plan will cover the uninsur by let peopl bui into the same kind of health care plan that member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
it will bring down cost by invest in inform technolog __PUNCT__ and prevent care __PUNCT__ and by stop the drug compani from price __PUNCT__ goug when patient need their medicin __PUNCT__

and it will save the averag famili a thousand dollar a year on their premium __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on educ __PUNCT__ to move past the slow decai of indiffer that sai some school can't be fix and some kid just can't learn __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a campaign to recruit and support hundr of thousand of new teacher across the countri __PUNCT__ becaus the most import part of ani educ is the person stand in the front of the classroom __PUNCT__

it time to turn the page on energi __PUNCT__ to break the polit stalem that kept our fuel effici standard in the same place for twenti year __PUNCT__ to tell the oil and auto industri that thei must act __PUNCT__ not onli becaus their futur at stake __PUNCT__ but becaus the futur of our countri and our planet is at stake as well __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will institut a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system that would dramat reduc carbon emiss and auction off emiss credit that would gener million of dollar to invest in renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__
i put in place a low __PUNCT__ carbon fuel standard like you have here in california that will take __NUM__ million car __PUNCT__ worth of pollut off the road __PUNCT__
and i rais the fuel effici standard for our car and truck becaus we know we have the technolog to do it and it time we did __PUNCT__
