it is a stori of immigr who set out from distant shore __PUNCT__ pioneer who persev __PUNCT__ and peopl of all race __PUNCT__ religion __PUNCT__ and ethnic group who put asid their doubt to seek a new frontier __PUNCT__
my own famili journei move west __PUNCT__ from kansa __PUNCT__ where my grandpar met and marri __PUNCT__ and my mother wa born __PUNCT__ to the pacif coast after world war ii __PUNCT__ and then across an ocean to hawaii __PUNCT__

the name of my cousin __PUNCT__ dick chenei __PUNCT__ will not be on the ballot __PUNCT__
but the choic befor you is about what come next __PUNCT__
becaus we need to do more than turn the page on the fail bush __PUNCT__ chenei polici __PUNCT__ we have to turn the page on the polit that help make those polici possibl __PUNCT__
lobbyist set an agenda in washington that feed the inequ __PUNCT__ insecur __PUNCT__ and instabl in our economi __PUNCT__
divis and distract that keep us from come togeth to deal with challeng like health care __PUNCT__ and clean energi __PUNCT__ and crumbl school year after year after year __PUNCT__
cronyism that gave us katrina instead of compet govern __PUNCT__
and secreci that made tortur permiss and illeg wiretap possibl __PUNCT__
it a polit that us 9/11 to scare up vote __PUNCT__ and fear and falsehood to lead us into a war in iraq that should never been author and should never been wage __PUNCT__
each candid run for the democrat nomin share an abid desir to end the disastr polici of the current administr __PUNCT__
but we must decid __PUNCT__ in the debat that lead to denver __PUNCT__ just what kind of parti we want to be __PUNCT__ and what lesson we learn from the bitter partisanship of the last two decad __PUNCT__
we can be a parti that tri to beat the other side by practic the same do __PUNCT__ anyth __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ anyth __PUNCT__ divis polit that ha stood in the wai of progress __PUNCT__ or we can be a parti that put an end to it __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i believ that we need fundament chang in america __PUNCT__
not just a chang of parti in the white hous __PUNCT__ but chang in washington that the american peopl can believ in __PUNCT__ uniti instead of divis __PUNCT__ hope instead of fear __PUNCT__ a polit that leav behind the fight of the past so that we can final take hold of our futur __PUNCT__
we began thi campaign on year ago on the step of the old statehous in springfield __PUNCT__
at the time __PUNCT__ we made a bet on the american peopl __PUNCT__
that bet wa simpl __PUNCT__ we weren't go to chang anyth by reli on the same washington game __PUNCT__ instead __PUNCT__ we were bet on the american peopl hunger for chang __PUNCT__ and your abil to make chang happen from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
and we ar show america what chang look like __PUNCT__
from the snow of iowa to the sunshin of south carolina __PUNCT__ we have built a movement of young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ black and white __PUNCT__ latino __PUNCT__ asian and nativ american __PUNCT__
we reach american of all polit stripe who ar more interest in turn the page than turn up the heat on our oppon __PUNCT__
that how democrat will win in __DATE__ and build a major in congress __PUNCT__
not by nomin a candid who will unit the other parti against us __PUNCT__ but by choos on who can unit thi countri around a movement for chang __PUNCT__
if you choos chang __PUNCT__ you will have a nomine who doesn't take a dime from washington lobbyist and pac __PUNCT__
we don't need a candid who agre with republican that lobbyist ar part of the system in washington __PUNCT__
thei part of the problem __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ their dai of set the agenda in washington will be over __PUNCT__
if you choos chang __PUNCT__ you will have a nomine who doesn't just tell peopl what thei want to hear __PUNCT__
poll __PUNCT__ test posit and calcul answer might be how washington confront challeng __PUNCT__ but it not how you overcom them __PUNCT__ it not how you inspir our nation to come togeth behind a common purpos __PUNCT__ and it not what america need right now __PUNCT__
if you choos chang __PUNCT__ you will have a nomine who isn't just plai on the same elector map where half the countri start out against us __PUNCT__ becaus you will have a nomine who ha alreadi brought in more independ and republican __PUNCT__ young peopl and new voter __PUNCT__ than we have seen in a gener __PUNCT__
i know it is tempt __PUNCT__ after anoth presid by a man name georg bush __PUNCT__ to simpli turn back the clock __PUNCT__ and to build a bridg back to the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
there ar those will tell us that our parti should nomin someon who is more practic in the art of pursu power __PUNCT__ that it not yet our turn or our time __PUNCT__
there wa also a time when carolin kennedi father wa counsel by a former presid to __PUNCT__ be patient __PUNCT__ and to step asid for __PUNCT__ someon with greater experi __PUNCT__ but john f __PUNCT__ kennedi respond by sai __PUNCT__ the world is chang __PUNCT__
the old wai will not do __PUNCT__ it is time for a new gener of leadership __PUNCT__

i am run for presid __PUNCT__ right now __PUNCT__ becaus i have met american all across thi countri who cannot afford to wait anoth dai for chang __PUNCT__
that is why the real choic in thi campaign is not between region or religion or gender __PUNCT__
