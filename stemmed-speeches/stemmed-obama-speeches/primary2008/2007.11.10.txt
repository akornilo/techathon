we were promis compassion conservat and all we got wa katrina and wiretap __PUNCT__
we were promis a unit __PUNCT__ and we got a presid who could not even lead the half of the countri that vote for him __PUNCT__
we were promis a more ethic and more effici govern __PUNCT__ and instead we have a town call washington that is more corrupt and more wast than it wa befor __PUNCT__
and the onli mission that wa ever accomplish is to us fear and falsehood to take thi countri to a war that should have never been author and should have never been wage __PUNCT__
it is becaus of these failur that america is listen __PUNCT__ intent __PUNCT__ to what we sai here todai __PUNCT__ not just democrat __PUNCT__ but republican and independ who lost trust in their govern __PUNCT__ but want to believ again __PUNCT__
