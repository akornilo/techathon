i visit mani school and spoken to mani teacher and student throughout my two decad of public servic __PUNCT__ but on i alwai rememb is my visit to dodg elementari school in chicago just a few year ago __PUNCT__
i wa talk with a young teacher there __PUNCT__ and i ask her what she saw as the biggest challeng face her student __PUNCT__
she gave me an answer that i had never heard befor __PUNCT__
she spoke about what she call __PUNCT__ these kid syndrom __PUNCT__ the tendenc to explain awai the shortcom and failur of our educ system by sai that __PUNCT__ these kid can't learn __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ these kid don't want to learn __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ these kid ar just too far behind __PUNCT__
and after awhil __PUNCT__ these kid __PUNCT__ becom somebodi els problem __PUNCT__
and thi teacher look at me and said __PUNCT__ when i hear that term it drive me nut __PUNCT__
thei not __PUNCT__ these kid __PUNCT__
thei our kid __PUNCT__
all of them __PUNCT__
she absolut right __PUNCT__
the small child in manchest or nashua whose parent can't find or afford a qualiti pre __PUNCT__ school that we know would make him more like to stai in school __PUNCT__ and read better __PUNCT__ and succe later in life __PUNCT__ he is our child __PUNCT__
the littl girl in rural south carolina or the south side of chicago whose school is liter fall down around her __PUNCT__ and can't afford new textbook __PUNCT__ and can't attract new teacher becaus it can't afford to pai them a decent salari __PUNCT__ she is our child __PUNCT__
the teenag in suburban boston who need more skill and better school to compet for the same job as the teenag in bangalor or beij __PUNCT__ he is our child __PUNCT__
these children ar our children __PUNCT__
their futur is our futur __PUNCT__
and it time we understood that their educ is our respons __PUNCT__
all of us __PUNCT__
thi is a defin moment for our gener __PUNCT__
revolut in commun and technolog have creat a global economi of high __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage job that can be locat anywher there an internet connect __PUNCT__ an economi where the most valuabl skill you can sell is your knowledg __PUNCT__
educ is now the currenc of the inform ag __PUNCT__
it no longer just a pathwai to opportun and success __PUNCT__ it a pre __PUNCT__ requisit __PUNCT__
there simpli aren't as mani job todai that can support a famili where onli a high school degre is requir __PUNCT__
and if you don't have that degre __PUNCT__ there ar even fewer job avail that can keep you out of poverti __PUNCT__
in thi kind of economi __PUNCT__ countri who out __PUNCT__ educ us todai will out __PUNCT__ compet us tomorrow __PUNCT__
alreadi __PUNCT__ china is graduat eight time as mani engin as we ar __PUNCT__
by twelfth grade __PUNCT__ our children score lower on math and scienc test than most other kid in the world __PUNCT__
and we now have on of the highest high school dropout rate of ani industri nation in the world __PUNCT__
well i do not accept thi futur for america __PUNCT__
i do not accept an america where we do noth about six million student who ar read below their grade level __PUNCT__ an america where sixti percent of african __PUNCT__ american fourth grader aren't even read at the basic level __PUNCT__
i do not accept an america where onli twenti percent of our student ar prepar to take colleg __PUNCT__ level class in english __PUNCT__ math __PUNCT__ and scienc __PUNCT__ where bare on in ten low __PUNCT__ incom student will ever graduat from colleg __PUNCT__
i do not accept an america where we do noth about the fact that half of all teenag ar unabl to understand basic fraction __PUNCT__ where nearli nine in ten african __PUNCT__ american and latino eighth grader ar not profici in math __PUNCT__
i do not accept an america where elementari school kid ar onli get an averag of twenti __PUNCT__ five minut of scienc each dai when we know that over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the fastest __PUNCT__ grow job requir a knowledg base in math and scienc __PUNCT__
thi kind of america is moral unaccept for our children __PUNCT__
it econom unten for our futur __PUNCT__
and it not who we ar as a countri __PUNCT__
we ar not a __PUNCT__ these kid __PUNCT__ nation __PUNCT__
we ar the nation that ha alwai understood that our futur is inextric link to the educ of our children __PUNCT__ all of them __PUNCT__
we ar the countri that ha alwai believ in thoma jefferson declar that __PUNCT__ __URL__ and virtu __PUNCT__ need in a free societi __PUNCT__ should be educ regardless of wealth or birth __PUNCT__
it thi belief that led america to set up the first free public school in small new england town __PUNCT__
it a promis we kept as we move from a nation of farm to factori and creat a system of public high school so that everyon had the chanc to succe in a new economi __PUNCT__
it a promis we expand after world war ii __PUNCT__ when america gave my grandfath and over two million return hero the chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__
and when america ha fallen short of thi promis __PUNCT__ when we forc linda brown to walk mile to a dilapid topeka school becaus of the color of her skin __PUNCT__ it wa ordinari american who march and bled __PUNCT__ who took to the street and fought in the court until the arriv of nine littl children at a littl rock school made real the decis that in america __PUNCT__ separ can never be equal __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
that why i can stand here todai __PUNCT__
becaus somebodi stood up when it wa hard __PUNCT__ stood up when it wa riski __PUNCT__
becaus even though my mother didn't have a lot of monei __PUNCT__ scholarship gave me the chanc to go to some of the best school in the countri __PUNCT__
and i am run for presid of the unit state becaus i want to give everi american child the same chanc that i had __PUNCT__
in thi elect __PUNCT__ at thi defin moment __PUNCT__ we can decid that thi centuri will be anoth american centuri by make an histor commit to educ __PUNCT__
we can make a commit that more than just the rhetor of a campaign __PUNCT__ on that more than anoth empti promis made by a politician look for your vote __PUNCT__
i often sai that the problem with no child left behind is that georg bush left the monei behind __PUNCT__
and it wasn't just him __PUNCT__ either __PUNCT__
it pretti popular to bash no child left behind out on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ but when it wa be debat in congress four year ago __PUNCT__ my colleagu dick durbin offer everyon a chanc to vote so that the law couldn't be enforc unless it wa fulli fund __PUNCT__
senat edward and senat clinton pass on that chanc __PUNCT__ and i believ that wa a seriou mistak __PUNCT__
becaus i think we all agre that the goal of thi law were the right on __PUNCT__
make a promis to educ everi child with an excel teacher is right __PUNCT__
close the achiev gap that exist in too mani citi and rural area is right __PUNCT__
make sure that necessari resourc and qualifi teacher ar distribut equit among everi citi and small town is right __PUNCT__
more account is right __PUNCT__
higher standard ar right __PUNCT__
but i tell you what wrong with no child left behind __PUNCT__
forc our teacher __PUNCT__ our princip __PUNCT__ and our school to accomplish all of thi without the resourc thei need is wrong __PUNCT__
promis high __PUNCT__ qualiti teacher in everi classroom and then leav the support and the pai for those teacher behind is wrong __PUNCT__
label a school and it student as failur on dai and then throw your hand up and walk awai from them the next is wrong __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ don't tell us that the onli wai to teach a child is to spend most of the year prepar him to fill in a few bubbl on a standard test __PUNCT__
don't tell us that these test have to come at the expens of music __PUNCT__ or art __PUNCT__ or phy __PUNCT__
ed __PUNCT__ or scienc __PUNCT__
these test shouldn't come at the expens of a well __PUNCT__ round educ __PUNCT__ thei should help complet that well __PUNCT__ round educ __PUNCT__
the teacher i met didn't devot their live to test __PUNCT__ thei devot them to teach __PUNCT__ and teach our children is what thei should be allow to do __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ no child left behind ha done more to stigmat and demor our student and teacher in struggl school than it ha to marshal the talent and the determin and the resourc to turn them around __PUNCT__
that what wrong with no child left behind __PUNCT__ and that what we must chang in a fundament wai __PUNCT__
i want to lead a new era of mutual respons in educ __PUNCT__ on where we all come togeth for the sake of our children success __PUNCT__ an era where each of us doe our part to make that success a realiti __PUNCT__ parent and teacher __PUNCT__ leader in washington and citizen all across america __PUNCT__
i won't pretend that thi will be easi __PUNCT__
we must fix the failur of no child left behind __PUNCT__
we must provid the fund we were promis __PUNCT__ and give our state the resourc thei need __PUNCT__ and final meet our commit to special educ __PUNCT__
but that alon is not an educ polici __PUNCT__
it just a start point __PUNCT__
a truli histor commit to educ __PUNCT__ a real commit __PUNCT__ will requir new resourc and new reform __PUNCT__
it will requir a willing to break free from the same debat that washington ha been engag in for decad __PUNCT__ democrat versu republican __PUNCT__ voucher versu the statu quo __PUNCT__ more monei versu more account __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ it will take a presid who is honest about the challeng we face __PUNCT__ who doesn't just tell everyon what thei want to hear __PUNCT__ but what thei need to hear __PUNCT__
i am run to be that presid __PUNCT__
and that why i propos a comprehens plan to give everi american child the chanc to receiv the best educ america ha to offer __PUNCT__ from the moment thei born to the dai thei graduat colleg __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will put the full resourc of the feder govern behind thi plan __PUNCT__
but to make it a realiti __PUNCT__ i will also ask more of teacher and princip __PUNCT__ parent and student __PUNCT__ school and commun __PUNCT__
a few week ago __PUNCT__ i introduc my plan to make colleg afford by creat a __MONEY__ per year refund tax credit that will cover two __PUNCT__ third of the tuition at the averag public colleg or univers __PUNCT__
and yesterdai __PUNCT__ i unveil my propos to strengthen our commun colleg by offer new degre for emerg field and reward school that graduat more student __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i want to talk about what we can do to prepar everi student to succe in colleg __PUNCT__ prepar that begin at birth and continu with world __PUNCT__ class school __PUNCT__ outstand teacher __PUNCT__ and transform princip __PUNCT__
the first part of my plan focus on provid qualiti __PUNCT__ afford earli childhood educ to everi american child __PUNCT__
we know what a differ earli childhood program make in the live of our kid __PUNCT__
studi after studi prove that children in these program __PUNCT__ especi low __PUNCT__ incom children __PUNCT__ ar more like to score higher in read and math __PUNCT__ more like to graduat high school and attend colleg __PUNCT__ more like to hold a job and more like to earn more on that job __PUNCT__
and for everi __MONEY__ we invest in these program __PUNCT__ we get __MONEY__ back in reduc welfar roll __PUNCT__ fewer health care cost __PUNCT__ and less crime __PUNCT__
in recent year __PUNCT__ state have been abl to enrol nearli on million four year old in pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten program __PUNCT__
that a great success __PUNCT__ but i believ we can do better __PUNCT__
we need to enrol more children and we need to start at an even earlier ag __PUNCT__
becaus the fact is __PUNCT__ studi show that from the time of concept to the first dai of kindergarten __PUNCT__ children develop progress faster than at ani other stage of life __PUNCT__
by the ag of three __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the brain core structur is alreadi form __PUNCT__
eighti __PUNCT__ five percent __PUNCT__
so here what we did in illinoi __PUNCT__
as a state senat __PUNCT__ i help creat the illinoi earli learn council __PUNCT__ which launch a program call preschool for all __PUNCT__
thi ha made us on of the first state to commit to a high qualiti earli learn program that start help children from the dai thei born __PUNCT__
it provid earli care and educ for new famili as well as at __PUNCT__ risk infant and toddler __PUNCT__ and offer at __PUNCT__ risk three __PUNCT__ year old and all four __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old the chanc to enrol in pre __PUNCT__ kindergarten program __PUNCT__
there is no reason we can't and shouldn't replic thi all across america __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a children first agenda that provid care __PUNCT__ learn and support to famili with children ag zero to five __PUNCT__
we creat earli learn grant to help state creat a system of high __PUNCT__ qualiti earli care and educ for all young children and their famili __PUNCT__
we increas head start fund and quadrupl earli start to includ a quarter of a million at __PUNCT__ risk children __PUNCT__
i will creat a presidenti earli learn council to coordin thi effort across all level of govern and ensur that we provid these children and famili with the highest qualiti program __PUNCT__
and we help more work parent find a safe __PUNCT__ afford place to leav their children dure the dai by improv the educ qualiti of our child care program and increas the child care tax credit __PUNCT__
that how we give our kid the best possibl start in life __PUNCT__ and that the commit america will make when i am presid __PUNCT__
the second part of my educ plan is to recruit __PUNCT__ support __PUNCT__ and reward teacher and princip to ensur that everi school in america is fill with outstand educ __PUNCT__
we know that from the moment our children step into a classroom __PUNCT__ the singl most import factor in determin their achiev is not the color of their skin or where thei come from __PUNCT__ it not who their parent ar or how much monei thei have __PUNCT__
it who their teacher is __PUNCT__
it the man or woman who stai past the last bell and spend their own monei on book and suppli __PUNCT__
it peopl like my sister who go beyond the call of duti becaus she believ that what make the extra differ __PUNCT__
and it doe __PUNCT__
well if we know how much teach matter __PUNCT__ it time america start act like it __PUNCT__
it time we treat teach like the profess it is __PUNCT__
i don't want to just talk about how great teacher ar __PUNCT__ i want to be a presid who reward them for their great __PUNCT__
that start with recruit a new gener of teacher and princip to replac the gener that retir and to keep up with the record number of student enter our school __PUNCT__
we creat a new servic scholarship program to recruit top talent into the profess __PUNCT__ and begin by place these new teacher in area like the overcrowd district of nevada __PUNCT__ or struggl rural town here in new hampshir __PUNCT__ or hard __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ staff subject like math and scienc in school all across the nation __PUNCT__
and i will make thi pledg as presid __PUNCT__ if you commit your life to teach __PUNCT__ america will commit to pai for your colleg educ __PUNCT__
to prepar our new teacher __PUNCT__ we requir that all school of educ ar accredit __PUNCT__ and we evalu their outcom so that we know which on ar do the best job at prepar the best teacher __PUNCT__
we also creat a voluntari nation perform assess that actual look at how prospect teacher can plan __PUNCT__ teach __PUNCT__ and support student learn __PUNCT__ so we can be sure that everi new educ is train and readi to walk into the classroom and start teach effect __PUNCT__
new hampshir is alreadi lead the wai here by have design a perform __PUNCT__ base educ prepar system __PUNCT__ and the nation assess i propos would help state like thi on achiev their goal for state __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ art prepar of all teacher __PUNCT__
to support our teacher __PUNCT__ we will expand mentor program that pair experienc __PUNCT__ success teacher with new recruit __PUNCT__
we know that mentor is on of the most effect wai to retain the on __PUNCT__ third of new teacher who leav the profess in the first five year __PUNCT__
in state that have tri thi __PUNCT__ like california __PUNCT__ onli five percent of new teacher have quit __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will expand these mentor program nationwid to give all our teacher the chanc to succe __PUNCT__
and i will also make sure that teacher have the condit in which thei can succe __PUNCT__ includ excel princip who support their work __PUNCT__ the materi thei need to teach effect __PUNCT__ and time to plan and collabor with on anoth on improv instruct __PUNCT__
and where thei do succe __PUNCT__ where our teacher and princip go abov and beyond the call to make a real differ in our children live __PUNCT__ i think it time we reward them for it __PUNCT__
citi like denver have alreadi proven that by work with teacher __PUNCT__ thi can work __PUNCT__ that we can find new wai to increas pai that ar develop with teacher __PUNCT__ not impos on them and not just base on an arbitrari test score __PUNCT__
my plan would provid resourc to try these innov program in school district all across america __PUNCT__
under my career ladder initi __PUNCT__ these district will be abl to design program that reward accomplish educ who serv as mentor to new teacher with the salari increas thei deserv __PUNCT__
thei can reward those who teach in underserv place like rural new hampshir and across urban america __PUNCT__
and if teacher acquir addit knowledg and skill to serv student better __PUNCT__ if thei consist excel in the classroom __PUNCT__ that work can be valu and reward as well __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if we do all thi and find that there ar teacher who ar still struggl and underperform __PUNCT__ we should provid them with individu help and support __PUNCT__
and if thei still underperform after that __PUNCT__ we should find a quick and fair wai to put anoth teacher in that classroom __PUNCT__
teacher associ and school board in a number of citi have led the wai by develop peer assist and review plan that do exactli thi __PUNCT__ set profession standard that put children first __PUNCT__
we ow our teacher that __PUNCT__ and we ow our children that __PUNCT__
and while we at it __PUNCT__ let final help our teacher and princip develop assess that teach our kid to becom more than just good test __PUNCT__ taker __PUNCT__
that why the third part of my plan is to work with our nation governor and educ to creat and us assess that can improv achiev all across america by includ the kind of research __PUNCT__ scientif investig __PUNCT__ and problem __PUNCT__ solv that our children will need to compet in a __NUM__ centuri knowledg economi __PUNCT__
new hampshir ha been a leader on thi __PUNCT__
you develop innov assess __PUNCT__ includ digit portfolio __PUNCT__ to develop and demonstr student profici in technolog __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ and other core content area __PUNCT__ and there no reason we can't start replic thi all across the countri __PUNCT__
the goal of educ test should be the same as medic test __PUNCT__ to diagnos a student need so you can help address them __PUNCT__
test should not be design as punish for teacher and student __PUNCT__ thei should be us as tool to help our children grow and compet __PUNCT__
test should support learn __PUNCT__ not just account __PUNCT__
becaus if we realli want our children to becom the great inventor and problem __PUNCT__ solver of tomorrow __PUNCT__ our school shouldn't stifl innov __PUNCT__ thei should let it thrive __PUNCT__
on of the subject area where thi is especi import is scienc __PUNCT__
no child left behind intens emphasi on teach to the test ha been shown to reduc the amount of time spent on teach and assess scienc __PUNCT__ a subject area that is absolut critic to our competit as a nation __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we will make scienc instruct a nation prioriti __PUNCT__ and we develop assess that don't just test isol bit of inform __PUNCT__ but advanc skill like logic __PUNCT__ data analysi __PUNCT__ and interpret __PUNCT__
new hampshir ha alreadi begun to do thi __PUNCT__ and there no reason the rest of the countri can't do the same thing __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ as you and i stand here todai __PUNCT__ know that there is a gener of children grow up on the mean street and forgotten corner of thi countri who ar slip awai from us as we speak __PUNCT__
thei walk down corridor of shame in rural south carolina and sit in batter classroom somewher in east l.a __PUNCT__
thei ar overwhelmingli black and latino and poor __PUNCT__
and when thei look around and see that no on ha lift a finger to fix their school sinc the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ when thei ar push out the door at the sound of the last bell __PUNCT__ some into a virtual war zone __PUNCT__ is it ani wonder thei don't think their educ is import __PUNCT__ is it ani wonder that thei ar drop out in rate we never seen befor __PUNCT__
i know these children __PUNCT__
i know their sens of hopeless __PUNCT__
i began my career over two decad ago as a commun organ on the street of chicago south side __PUNCT__
and i work with parent and teacher and local leader to fight for their futur __PUNCT__
we set up after school program and we even protest outsid govern offic so that we could get those who had drop out into altern school __PUNCT__
and in time __PUNCT__ we chang futur __PUNCT__
and so while i know hopeless __PUNCT__ i also know hope __PUNCT__
i know that if we bring earli educ program to these commun __PUNCT__ if we stop wait until high __PUNCT__ school to address the drop __PUNCT__ out rate and start in earlier grade __PUNCT__ if we bring in new __PUNCT__ qualifi teacher __PUNCT__ if we expand colleg outreach program like gear up and trio and fight to expand summer learn opportun like i done in the senat __PUNCT__ if we do all thi __PUNCT__ we can make a differ in the live of our children and the life of thi countri __PUNCT__ not just in east l.a __PUNCT__ or the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ but here in manchest __PUNCT__ and suburban boston __PUNCT__ and rural mississippi __PUNCT__
i know we can __PUNCT__
i seen it happen __PUNCT__
and i will work everi dai to do it again as your presid __PUNCT__
but i cannot do it alon __PUNCT__
govern cannot do it alon __PUNCT__
we can spend billion after billion on educ in thi countri __PUNCT__
we can develop a program for everi problem imagin __PUNCT__ and we can fund those program with everi last dime we have __PUNCT__
but there is no program and no polici that can substitut for a parent who is involv in their child educ from dai on __PUNCT__
there is no substitut for a parent who will attend those parent/teach confer __PUNCT__ make sure their children ar in school on time __PUNCT__ and help them with their homework after dinner __PUNCT__
and i have no doubt that we will still be talk about these problem in the next centuri if we do not have parent who ar will to turn off the tv onc in awhil __PUNCT__ and put awai the video game __PUNCT__ and read to their child __PUNCT__
respons for our children educ ha to start at home __PUNCT__
we have to set high standard for them __PUNCT__ and spend time with them __PUNCT__ and love them __PUNCT__
we have to hold ourselv account __PUNCT__
you know a few year ago __PUNCT__ a littl girl at earhart elementari in chicago wa ask the secret to her academ success __PUNCT__
she said __PUNCT__ i just studi hard everi night becaus i like learn __PUNCT__
my teacher want me to be a good student __PUNCT__ and so doe my mother __PUNCT__
i don't want to let them down __PUNCT__
the challeng we face at thi moment is great __PUNCT__ but we have met great challeng befor __PUNCT__
over the cours of two centuri __PUNCT__ we have fought and struggl and overcom to expand the promis of a good educ ever further __PUNCT__ a promis that ha allow million to transcend the barrier of race and class and background to achiev their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
it is now our moment to keep that promis __PUNCT__ the promis of america __PUNCT__ aliv in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
it our gener turn to stand up and sai to the littl girl in chicago __PUNCT__ or the littl boi in manchest __PUNCT__ or the million like them all across the countri that thei ar not __PUNCT__ these kid __PUNCT__ thei ar our kid __PUNCT__
thei do not want to let us down __PUNCT__ and we cannot let them down either __PUNCT__
that what i be fight for in thi elect __PUNCT__ and that what i do as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i hope you join me in that journei __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
