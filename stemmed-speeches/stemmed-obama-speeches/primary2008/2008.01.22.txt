for the second dai in a row __PUNCT__ the global stock market ha continu to plung as the world continu to fear that the unit state govern won't do enough to prevent a recess __PUNCT__
we hope that the rate cut announc thi morn will restor some confid and stop the damag __PUNCT__ but the fear remain __PUNCT__
it a fear that hasn't just confin itself to those who nervous watch the ticker or scan the headlin of the financi section __PUNCT__ but on that i have seen on the face of work american in everi corner of thi countri long befor anxieti ever hit wall street __PUNCT__
i seen it in the face of famili who ar be forc to foreclos on their dream becaus an unscrupul lender trick them into bui a home thei couldn't afford just to pocket a profit __PUNCT__
i seen it in the face of maytag worker who labor all their live onli to see their job ship oversea __PUNCT__ who now compet with their teenag for __MONEY__ job at wal __PUNCT__ mart __PUNCT__
and i seen it in the face of a young woman who told me she onli get three hour of sleep becaus she work the night shift after a full dai of colleg and still can't afford health care for a sister who ill __PUNCT__
in the last sever month __PUNCT__ their fear have grown wors and ar now share by more and more american __PUNCT__
what start as a crisi in the hous market ha now spill over to the rest of the economi __PUNCT__
bank ar face a credit crunch __PUNCT__ leav busi with less monei to invest and more american unabl to get loan __PUNCT__
jobless rose more last month than at ani time sinc just after 9/11 __PUNCT__ and oil reach __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__
peopl have less monei to spend __PUNCT__ higher bill to pai __PUNCT__ and fewer opportun for work __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ we were warn thi might happen __PUNCT__
but washington did what washington doe __PUNCT__ it look the other wai __PUNCT__
it reward lender and lobbyist with whatev thei ask for while ignor the voic of work peopl who need help most __PUNCT__
and all the while __PUNCT__ we been led by georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__ a presid who done more to contribut to thi countri widen inequ than anyon sinc herbert hoover __PUNCT__ a presid whose tax break for wealthi american who didn't need them and didn't ask for them have onli encourag the mindset in washington and on wall street that __PUNCT__ what good for me is good enough __PUNCT__
that why it no surpris that after month and month of watch famili struggl to get by in thi economi __PUNCT__ georg bush final offer a stimulu plan last week that neglect __NUM__ million worker and senior who need our help the most __PUNCT__ the veri peopl who ar most like to spend and give our economi the boost it need right now __PUNCT__
well georg bush econom plan haven't work befor and thei not go to start work now __PUNCT__
more importantli __PUNCT__ thei don't reflect who we ar as american __PUNCT__
we haven't come thi far becaus we practic surviv of the fittest __PUNCT__
america is america becaus we strive for surviv of the nation __PUNCT__ a nation where no on is left behind and everyon ha a chanc to achiev their dream __PUNCT__
that who we ar __PUNCT__
and that who we can be again at thi defin moment __PUNCT__
thi isn't an issu i found along the campaign trail __PUNCT__
i introduc legisl to stop mortgag fraud and predatori lend almost two year ago __PUNCT__
i call for a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut back in __DATE__ that would put monei into the pocket of over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of work american __PUNCT__ that would elimin incom tax for senior make less than __MONEY__ __PUNCT__ that would give a tax credit to struggl homeown __PUNCT__
and that why when i announc my econom stimulu packag the other week __PUNCT__ i call for immedi tax relief for work famili and senior __PUNCT__ becaus thei shouldn't have to wait anoth dai for washington to act __PUNCT__
thei need our help right now __PUNCT__
we should send each work famili a __MONEY__ tax cut and each senior a __MONEY__ supplement to their social secur check __PUNCT__
and if the economi continu to declin in the come week __PUNCT__ we should do it again __PUNCT__
thi is the quickest wai to help peopl pai their bill and get them to start spend __PUNCT__
we should also immedi make unemploy insur avail for a longer period of time and for more peopl who ar face job loss __PUNCT__ and we should make sure it benefit part __PUNCT__ time and non __PUNCT__ tradit worker __PUNCT__ someth that will particularli help women __PUNCT__ african __PUNCT__ american and latino __PUNCT__
we should help those face foreclosur refin their mortgag and stai in their home __PUNCT__ and we should provid direct relief to victim of mortgag fraud __PUNCT__
and we should provid assist to state and local govern so that thei don't slash critic servic like health care or educ __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ it easi to propos plan and polici when you on the campaign trail __PUNCT__
you can make all sort of promis and tell peopl what thei want to hear when thei want to hear it __PUNCT__
but in thi time of econom anxieti and uncertainti __PUNCT__ what thi countri need most is a presid who sai what he mean and mean what he sai __PUNCT__ a presid who won't just do what right when the polit ar easi __PUNCT__ but when the polit ar hard __PUNCT__ a presid who not just in it to win it __PUNCT__ but in it for you __PUNCT__
in the debat last night __PUNCT__ we spent some time talk about the economi __PUNCT__
and on of the thing i brought up that concern me wa that when senat clinton first releas her econom stimulu plan __PUNCT__ she didn't think that worker or senior need immedi tax relief __PUNCT__
she thought it could wait until thing got wors __PUNCT__
five dai later __PUNCT__ the economi didn't realli chang __PUNCT__ but the polit appar did __PUNCT__ becaus she chang her plan to look just like mine __PUNCT__
it remind me of what happen when we start debat the credit card industri bankruptci bill __PUNCT__ a bill that would make it much harder for work famili to climb out of debt __PUNCT__
believ it or not __PUNCT__ senat clinton said again last night that even though she vote for the bill __PUNCT__ she wa glad it didn't pass __PUNCT__
i know you can get awai with thi in washington __PUNCT__ but most of us know that if you don't want to see a bill pass __PUNCT__ there a pretti easi option avail __PUNCT__ you can vote against it __PUNCT__
and we heard her sai the same kind of thing about nafta and china trade __PUNCT__ agreement that sent million of american job __PUNCT__ thousand from thi veri state __PUNCT__ oversea __PUNCT__
becaus onli in washington could senat clinton sai that nafta led to econom improv up until she start run for presid __PUNCT__
now she sai we need a time __PUNCT__ out on trade __PUNCT__
no on know when thi time __PUNCT__ out will end __PUNCT__
mayb after the elect __PUNCT__
the point is __PUNCT__ thi is exactli the kind of polit we can't afford right now __PUNCT__
not when the stake ar thi high __PUNCT__
not when the economi is thi fragil __PUNCT__
not when so mani bank ar foreclos on peopl dream __PUNCT__
we can't afford a presid whose posit chang with the polit of the moment __PUNCT__ we need a presid who know that be readi on dai on mean get it right from dai on __PUNCT__

we know the road ahead will be difficult __PUNCT__
none of the problem we face will be easi to solv and chang will not happen overnight __PUNCT__
it will take a new spirit of cooper and sacrific __PUNCT__
it will requir each of us to remind ourselv that we rise and fall as on nation __PUNCT__ and that a countri in which onli a few prosper is antithet to our ideal and our democraci __PUNCT__
