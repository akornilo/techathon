befor i begin __PUNCT__ i just want to send my condol to the victim of the storm that hit tennesse and arkansa __PUNCT__
thei ar in our thought and in our prayer __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the poll ar just close in california and the vote ar still be count in citi and town across the countri __PUNCT__
but there is on thing on thi __DATE__ night that we do not need the final result to know __PUNCT__ our time ha come __PUNCT__ our movement is real __PUNCT__ and chang is come to america __PUNCT__
onli a few hundr mile from here __PUNCT__ almost on year ago to the dai __PUNCT__ we stood on the step of the old state capitol to reaffirm a truth that wa spoken there so mani gener ago __PUNCT__ that a hous divid cannot stand __PUNCT__ that we ar more than a collect of red state and blue state __PUNCT__ we ar __PUNCT__ and alwai will be __PUNCT__ the unit state of america __PUNCT__
what began as a whisper in springfield soon carri across the corn field of iowa __PUNCT__ where farmer and factori worker __PUNCT__ student and senior stood up in number we never seen __PUNCT__
thei stood up to sai that mayb thi year __PUNCT__ we don't have to settl for a polit where score point is more import than solv problem __PUNCT__
thi time we can final do someth about health care we can't afford or mortgag we can't pai __PUNCT__
thi time can be differ __PUNCT__
their voic echo from the hill of new hampshir to the desert of nevada __PUNCT__ where teacher and cook and kitchen worker stood up to sai that mayb washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyist anymor __PUNCT__
thei reach the coast of south carolina when peopl said that mayb we don't have to be divid by race and region and gender __PUNCT__ that crumbl school ar steal the futur of black children and white children __PUNCT__ that we can come togeth and build an america that give everi child __PUNCT__ everywher the opportun to live their dream __PUNCT__
thi time can be differ __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ on thi tuesdai in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ in state north and south __PUNCT__ east and west __PUNCT__ what began as a whisper in springfield ha swell to a choru of million call for chang __PUNCT__
a choru that cannot be ignor __PUNCT__
that cannot be deter __PUNCT__
thi time can be differ becaus thi campaign for the presid is differ __PUNCT__
it differ not becaus of me __PUNCT__ but becaus of you __PUNCT__
becaus you ar tire of be disappoint and tire of be let down __PUNCT__
you tire of hear promis made and plan propos in the heat of a campaign onli to have noth chang when everyon goe back to washington __PUNCT__
becaus the lobbyist just write anoth check __PUNCT__
or becaus politician start worri about how thei win the next elect instead of why thei should __PUNCT__
or becaus thei focu on who up and who down instead of who matter __PUNCT__
and while washington is consum with the same drama and divis and distract __PUNCT__ anoth famili put up a for sale sign in the front yard __PUNCT__
anoth factori shut it door __PUNCT__
anoth soldier wave goodby as he leav on anoth tour of duti in a war that should never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
it goe on and on and on __PUNCT__
but in thi elect __PUNCT__ at thi moment __PUNCT__ you ar stand up all across thi countri to sai __PUNCT__ not thi time __PUNCT__
not thi year __PUNCT__
the stake ar too high and the challeng too great to plai the same washington game with the same washington player and expect a differ result __PUNCT__
thi time must be differ __PUNCT__

it the futur versu the past __PUNCT__
it a choic between go into thi elect with republican and independ alreadi unit against us __PUNCT__ or go against their nomine with a campaign that ha unit american of all parti around a common purpos __PUNCT__
it a choic between have a debat with the other parti about who ha the most experi in washington __PUNCT__ or have on about who most like to chang washington __PUNCT__
becaus that a debat we can win __PUNCT__
it a choic between a candid who taken more monei from washington lobbyist than either republican in thi race __PUNCT__ and a campaign that hasn't taken a dime of their monei becaus we been fund by you __PUNCT__
and if i am your nomine __PUNCT__ my oppon will not be abl to sai that i vote for the war in iraq __PUNCT__ or that i gave georg bush the benefit of the doubt on iran __PUNCT__ or that i support the bush __PUNCT__ chenei polici of not talk to leader we don't like __PUNCT__
and he will not be abl to sai that i waver on someth as fundament as whether or not it ok for america to us tortur __PUNCT__ becaus it is never ok __PUNCT__
that is the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
the republican run for presid have alreadi ti themselv to the past __PUNCT__

our volunt felt so defeat __PUNCT__ thei want to quit __PUNCT__

thei were like boi in so mani citi across the countri __PUNCT__ boi without prospect __PUNCT__ without guidanc __PUNCT__ without hope __PUNCT__
and i turn to the volunt __PUNCT__ and i ask them __PUNCT__ befor you quit __PUNCT__ i want you to answer on question __PUNCT__

chang will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time __PUNCT__
we ar the on we been wait for __PUNCT__

we ar the hope of those boi who have littl __PUNCT__ who been told that thei cannot have what thei dream __PUNCT__ that thei cannot be what thei imagin __PUNCT__
ye thei can __PUNCT__
we ar the hope of the father who goe to work befor dawn and li awak with doubt that tell him he cannot give hi children the same opportun that someon gave him __PUNCT__
ye he can __PUNCT__
we ar the hope of the woman who hear that her citi will not be rebuilt __PUNCT__ that she cannot reclaim the life that wa swept awai in a terribl storm __PUNCT__
ye she can __PUNCT__
we ar the hope of the futur __PUNCT__ the answer to the cynic who tell us our hous must stand divid __PUNCT__ that we cannot come togeth __PUNCT__ that we cannot remak thi world as it should be __PUNCT__
becaus we know what we have seen and what we believ __PUNCT__ that what began as a whisper ha now swell to a choru that cannot be ignor __PUNCT__ that will not be deter __PUNCT__ that will ring out across thi land as a hymn that will heal thi nation __PUNCT__ repair thi world __PUNCT__ and make thi time differ than all the rest __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
