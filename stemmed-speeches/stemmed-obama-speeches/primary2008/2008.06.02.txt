wherev i go __PUNCT__ i talk about how we need to bring about real chang in thi countri __PUNCT__
and few understand the need for chang as well as folk here in michigan __PUNCT__
becaus while we been talk about a recess in thi countri for a few month now __PUNCT__ michigan ha been live it for a veri long time __PUNCT__
michigan ha the highest unemploy rate in the nation and worker and commun across thi state have been struggl for year with the downturn that all of america is feel todai __PUNCT__
in fair __PUNCT__ some of these challeng ar the product of larger forc beyond the control of govern __PUNCT__
but there is no doubt that the bush econom polici have done littl to help the work famili of michigan or build a better futur for america __PUNCT__
that is __PUNCT__ in larg part __PUNCT__ what thi elect in __DATE__ will be all about __PUNCT__
becaus senat mccain sai we have made __PUNCT__ and thi is a quot __PUNCT__ great progress econom __PUNCT__ these past eight year __PUNCT__ and he promis more of the same __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i couldn't disagre more __PUNCT__
sinc georg bush took offic __PUNCT__ we gone through the first period of sustain econom growth sinc world war ii in which the incom of american worker have actual drop __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million more american don't have health care __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million more american ar out of work __PUNCT__
million of famili ar face foreclosur __PUNCT__
you work harder for less __PUNCT__ and pai more for tuition __PUNCT__ more for groceri __PUNCT__ and more at the pump __PUNCT__
to me __PUNCT__ thi isn't __PUNCT__ great progress __PUNCT__
thi is a caus for concern and an impetu for chang __PUNCT__
yet senat mccain want to doubl down on the bush econom plan __PUNCT__
rather than reform an unfair tax system and offer the middl class some relief __PUNCT__ he offer more tax loophol for corpor and the wealthi we just can't afford __PUNCT__
rather than make health care afford for everi american __PUNCT__ like i propos __PUNCT__ he offer a health care plan that put coverag at risk and that design for folk who ar alreadi healthi and abl to afford health care at ani price __PUNCT__
and rather than stand up for robust trade that work for all american __PUNCT__ as i do __PUNCT__ he support more trade deal that work for wall street __PUNCT__ but not for main street __PUNCT__
but understand __PUNCT__ there a reason the problem we face todai ar so much bigger than thei were sever year ago __PUNCT__
a big part of it is that georg bush and john mccain have been so focus on pursu a flaw and costli war in iraq that thei lost sight of our mount problem here at home __PUNCT__
instead of work to fix our economi and lift up hardwork famili __PUNCT__ thei fought to extend a war that cost thousand of live and billion of dollar without make us ani safer __PUNCT__ a war that ha strengthen our enemi and distract us from the real battl with osama bin ladin in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
just to put thi in perspect __PUNCT__ for what taxpay here in oakland counti have spent in iraq __PUNCT__ you could be provid health care for nearli __NUM__ peopl __PUNCT__ or offer more than __NUM__ colleg scholarship for michigan student __PUNCT__ or hire more than __NUM__ elementari school teacher __PUNCT__
and now it seem like all senat mccain is talk about on the campaign trail is iraq __PUNCT__ instead of offer real solut to the problem you face everi dai __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ senat mccain conced not long ago that he didn't know much about the economi __PUNCT__
that not hi interest __PUNCT__
that not hi prioriti __PUNCT__
but it will be mine __PUNCT__
i want to end a war that cost america __MONEY__ billion a month and begin to make the critic invest we need to get our own countri move again __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
ar we go to continu the fail bush __PUNCT__ mccain econom polici and remain mire in an endless and costli conflict in iraq __PUNCT__ or will we chang cours __PUNCT__ and focu on the problem that work famili in michigan and across america ar face everi dai __PUNCT__
i believ strongli that we ar on the wrong path __PUNCT__ and that we need new prioriti and a new direct and that is why i run for presid or the unit state __PUNCT__
