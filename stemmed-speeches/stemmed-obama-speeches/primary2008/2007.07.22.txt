i have been run for presid now for a littl over five month __PUNCT__
and in that time __PUNCT__ i have been inspir by crowd ten of thousand of peopl strong __PUNCT__ mani who have come out for the veri first polit event of their lifetim __PUNCT__
we have seen more american sign up and contribut so far than ani other campaign in histori __PUNCT__
thei ar young and old __PUNCT__ republican and democrat __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ and black __PUNCT__ and latino __PUNCT__
i like to take the all the credit here myself __PUNCT__ but as my wife remind me everi dai __PUNCT__ i just not that great __PUNCT__
the real reason that so mani peopl ar come out and sign up is becaus thei see in thi campaign the potenti for the chang american ar so hungri for __PUNCT__
it not just the kind of chang you hear about in slogan or from politician everi few year __PUNCT__ it the kind of bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ grassroot movement that can transform a nation __PUNCT__
la raza ha alwai repres thi kind of movement __PUNCT__
you didn't get your start as some top __PUNCT__ down interest group in washington __PUNCT__ you got your start stand up for the dream and aspir of latino in farm field and barrio all across america __PUNCT__
you got your start almost forti year ago in place like southern california __PUNCT__ where farm worker and their children were beaten becaus thei ask for the right to organ __PUNCT__ becaus thei believ that pick grape all dai in the hot sun should be reward with a decent wage and protect from deadli pesticid __PUNCT__
and when a man name cesar chavez saw thi injustic __PUNCT__ he knew it wasn't right and so he went about organ those worker __PUNCT__
and on fate dai he decid to draw the ey of the nation to their caus by sit down for a hunger strike __PUNCT__
he went without food for twenti __PUNCT__ five dai __PUNCT__ and at on point he receiv a telegram from an atlanta preacher who wa busi lead hi own strike of sanit worker all the wai in memphi __PUNCT__ tennesse __PUNCT__
the telegram from dr __PUNCT__ martin luther king __PUNCT__ jr __PUNCT__ to cesar chavez said thi __PUNCT__ as brother in the fight for equal __PUNCT__ i extend the hand of fellowship and good will and wish continu success to you and your member __PUNCT__
our separ struggl ar realli on __PUNCT__
a struggl for freedom __PUNCT__ for digniti __PUNCT__ and for human __PUNCT__
our separ struggl ar realli on __PUNCT__
it wa a belief that dr __PUNCT__ king repeat often when he would sai that an injustic anywher is a threat to justic everywher __PUNCT__
it mean that the civil right movement wasn't just a movement of african __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__ but latino american __PUNCT__ and white american __PUNCT__ and everi american who believ that equal and opportun ar not just word to be said but promis to be kept __PUNCT__
the civil right movement wa your movement too __PUNCT__ and it unfinish work is still the task of everi american __PUNCT__
our separ struggl ar realli on __PUNCT__
if there a child stuck in a crumbl school who graduat without ever learn how to read __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter if that child is a latino from miami or an african __PUNCT__ american from chicago or a white girl from rural kentucki __PUNCT__ she is our child __PUNCT__ and her struggl is our struggl __PUNCT__
it doesn't matter if the injustic involv a brown man who badger into prove hi citizenship again and again or a black man who pull over becaus the car he drive is too nice __PUNCT__ it injustic either wai and we all have a role in end it __PUNCT__
whether you on of the __NUM__ million american without health care in thi countri __PUNCT__ or the on in five african american __PUNCT__ or the on in three latino __PUNCT__ it will take all of us to stand up to a drug and insur industri that spent __MONEY__ billion in lobbi to block health care reform __PUNCT__
that the kind of movement we need in america __PUNCT__
it won't be enough to chang parti in thi elect if we don't also chang a polit that ha tri to divid us for far too long __PUNCT__
becaus when we spend all our time keep score of who up and who down __PUNCT__ the onli winner ar those who can afford to plai the game __PUNCT__ those with the most monei __PUNCT__ and influenc __PUNCT__ and power __PUNCT__
that why right now __PUNCT__ the experi we need in the next presid is the proven abil to bring peopl to the tabl and get thing done __PUNCT__
we need a leader who will to tell the lobbyist and special interest that while thei get a seat at that tabl __PUNCT__ the dai of them bui everi chair ar over __PUNCT__
i run for presid becaus i have been that kind of leader my entir life __PUNCT__
i wa too young to particip in the civil right movement __PUNCT__ but i wa inspir by leader like king and chavez to becom a commun organ __PUNCT__
almost twenti __PUNCT__ five year ago __PUNCT__ i wa hire by a group of church on the south side of chicago to help turn around neighborhood that had been devast by the close of nearbi steel plant __PUNCT__
i knew that chang wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__ but i also knew it would be imposs without bring folk togeth and build a movement within the commun __PUNCT__
so i reach out and form coalit between latino leader and black leader on everi issu from fail school to illeg dump to unimmun children __PUNCT__
and togeth __PUNCT__ we made progress __PUNCT__
we set up job train and after school program __PUNCT__ and we taught peopl on the south side to stand up to their govern when it wasn't stand up for them __PUNCT__
but i didn't stop there __PUNCT__
when all the cynic said it wasn't possibl __PUNCT__ i kept build coalit and make progress throughout my eight year in the illinoi state senat __PUNCT__
thei told me i couldn't reform a death penalti system that had sent __NUM__ innoc peopl to death row __PUNCT__
but we did that __PUNCT__
thei told me that try to pass new racial profil law to protect black folk and brown folk would stir up too much controversi __PUNCT__
but we did that too __PUNCT__
and thei doubt whether we could put govern back on the side of averag peopl __PUNCT__ but we put __MONEY__ million worth of tax cut in the pocket of the low __PUNCT__ incom worker and pass health care reform that insur anoth __NUM__ children and parent __PUNCT__
so i want you to rememb on thing __PUNCT__ becaus you be hear from a lot of candid todai __PUNCT__
when i talk about hope __PUNCT__ when i talk about chang __PUNCT__ when i talk about hold america up to it ideal of opportun and equal __PUNCT__ thi isn't just the rhetor of a campaign for me __PUNCT__ it been the caus of my life __PUNCT__ a caus i will work for and fight for everi dai as your presid __PUNCT__
i will be a presid who rememb that our separ struggl ar realli on __PUNCT__
i will never walk awai from the tough battl or the difficult work of bring peopl togeth __PUNCT__
and i will never walk awai from the __NUM__ million undocu immigr who live __PUNCT__ work __PUNCT__ and contribut to our countri everi singl dai __PUNCT__
there ar few better exampl of how broken __PUNCT__ bitter __PUNCT__ and divis our polit ha becom than the immigr debat that plai out in washington a few week ago __PUNCT__
so mani of us __PUNCT__ democrat and republican __PUNCT__ were will to compromis in order to pass comprehens reform that would secur our border while give the undocu a chanc to earn their citizenship __PUNCT__
we knew that the american peopl believ that we ar a nation of law __PUNCT__ that we have a right and duti to protect our border __PUNCT__
and we should also crack down on employ who hire undocu worker so that we can protect job and wage __PUNCT__
but the american peopl also know that we ar a nation of immigr __PUNCT__ a nation that ha alwai been will to give weari travel from around the world the chanc to come here and reach for the dream that so mani of us have reach for __PUNCT__
that the america that answer my father letter and hi prayer and brought him here from kenya so long ago __PUNCT__
that the america we believ in __PUNCT__
but that the america that the presid and too mani republican walk awai from when the polit got tough __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar plenti of peopl oppos to immigr reform for principl reason that i happen to disagre with __PUNCT__
but thi time around __PUNCT__ we saw part of the immigr debat took a turn that wa both ugli and racist in a wai we haven't seen sinc the struggl for civil right __PUNCT__
well we didn't walk awai from injustic then and we won't walk awai from it todai __PUNCT__
i keep fight __PUNCT__ and i keep attend immigr ralli __PUNCT__ and i keep believ that we can have a civil debat about immigr where we begin to recogn ourselv in on anoth __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ i will put comprehens immigr reform back on the nation agenda and i will not rest until it is pass onc and for all __PUNCT__
but you and i know that the struggl we share goe far beyond immigr __PUNCT__
we don't expect our govern to guarante success and happi __PUNCT__ but when million of children start the race of life so far behind onli becaus of race __PUNCT__ onli becaus of class __PUNCT__ that a betray of our ideal __PUNCT__
that not just a latino problem or an african __PUNCT__ american problem __PUNCT__ that is an american problem that we have to solv __PUNCT__
it an american problem when latino ar the most like to be uninsur even though thei make up a disproportion share of the workforc __PUNCT__
it an american problem when on in four latino cannot commun well with their doctor about what wrong or fill out medic form becaus there ar languag barrier we refus to break down __PUNCT__
it an american problem that our health care system is broken and it time to fix it onc and for all __PUNCT__
i have a univers health care plan that will cover everi american and cut the cost of a typic famili premium by up to __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
it a plan that let the uninsur bui insur that similar to the kind member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
if you can't afford that __PUNCT__ you get a subsidi to pai for it __PUNCT__
and it goe further than ani other propos plan in cut the cost of health care by invest in technolog and prevent care __PUNCT__ break the stranglehold the drug and insur industri have on the health care market __PUNCT__ and help busi and famili shoulder the cost of the most expens condit so that an ill doesn't lead to a bankruptci __PUNCT__
and i promis you thi __PUNCT__ i will sign thi univers health care plan by the end of my first term in offic as your presid __PUNCT__
count on it __PUNCT__
it also time for thi countri to keep the promis of a world __PUNCT__ class educ for everi child __PUNCT__ becaus it an american problem when nearli half of all latino student do not receiv a high school diploma __PUNCT__
it an american problem when too mani of these student who want to learn english don't have the resourc to learn english and ar punish as a result __PUNCT__
let give our kid everyth thei could possibl need to have a fight chanc __PUNCT__
let not pass a law call no child left behind and then leav the monei behind __PUNCT__
let final invest in what make the most differ in ani child educ __PUNCT__ the person stand in the front of the classroom __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will launch a campaign to recruit hundr of thousand of new teacher across the countri __PUNCT__ and i pai them like the profession thei ar __PUNCT__
and let make sure ani child who come here and studi here and doe well in school get the same chanc to attend a public colleg as anyon els __PUNCT__
i help pass the dream act in illinoi __PUNCT__ and i will do the same as presid __PUNCT__
and there on other thing we can do __PUNCT__
for million of latino and other american __PUNCT__ the cornerston of the american dream is the abil to own your own home __PUNCT__
you work hard for it __PUNCT__ and you save for it __PUNCT__ and you will to sacrific to bui it __PUNCT__
but there is an armi of lender and broker out there who ar readi and will to take advantag of your hope and cheat you out of your dream __PUNCT__
thei lurk in your neighborhood and sometim thei even come into your church and thei offer you these subprim mortgag loan __PUNCT__
thei make them sound easi and afford and thei tell you to ignor the fine print and ask you to sign on the dot line __PUNCT__
your first coupl of payment ar ok __PUNCT__ but then after month go by __PUNCT__ the cost of your monthli payment start jump __PUNCT__
then it jump some more __PUNCT__
pretti soon you pai almost all of your incom on your hous payment __PUNCT__
and eventu __PUNCT__ you forc to foreclos on your dream __PUNCT__
and the worst part is that the lender knew thi would happen from dai on __PUNCT__
a recent report show that __NUM__ million sub __PUNCT__ prime loan made in recent year have fail or will end in foreclosur __PUNCT__ cost homeown as much as __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
latino hold up to __NUM__ percent of these mortgag __PUNCT__
african american hold over half __PUNCT__
thi is no accid __PUNCT__
these loan ar discriminatori __PUNCT__ thei ar dishonest __PUNCT__ and it time for us to treat these fraudul lender like the crimin that thei ar __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will make law the legisl i alreadi introduc that would crack down on lender and broker found guilti of fraud by increas enforc and creat new crimin penalti __PUNCT__
we also do more to protect homeown from fraud in the first place by provid them counsel so thei get the advic thei need both befor and after thei bui their home __PUNCT__
we even creat an easi __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ read __PUNCT__ easi __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ understand measur call the home score that let you figur out exactli what a mortgag will cost you both initi and down the road __PUNCT__
no on should get trick into lose their home so that some loan shark can make a profit __PUNCT__ and i will make sure of that as your presid __PUNCT__
we can do that __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ a coupl of year ago __PUNCT__ right around the time of the first immigr debat __PUNCT__ i attend a natur workshop at a church in chicago __PUNCT__
i walk down the aisl of the church and met peopl who were clutch their american flag __PUNCT__ wait to be call up so thei could start the long process of becom citizen __PUNCT__
at on point __PUNCT__ a littl girl came up to me and ask me for my autograph __PUNCT__
she said her name wa cristina __PUNCT__ that she wa studi govern __PUNCT__ and want to show the autograph to her third grade class __PUNCT__
i told her parent thei should be proud of her __PUNCT__
and as i watch cristina translat my word into spanish for them __PUNCT__ i thought for a moment about dr __PUNCT__ king telegram to cesar chavez __PUNCT__ and i knew that __PUNCT__ in the end __PUNCT__ our separ dream ar realli on as well __PUNCT__
it the dream my father had when he arriv here from kenya __PUNCT__
the dream cristina parent had for her __PUNCT__
and the dream that i have for my own two daughter __PUNCT__
i chose a career in public servic almost twenti __PUNCT__ five year ago becaus each night that i tuck them in __PUNCT__ i realiz that their chanc in life depend on our abil to creat a countri where what thei look like and where thei come from ha no bear on what thei can becom __PUNCT__
that what ha guid my life work __PUNCT__ and if you give me the chanc __PUNCT__ that exactli the kind of countri i will work for as your presid __PUNCT__
i ask you to give me that chanc __PUNCT__
