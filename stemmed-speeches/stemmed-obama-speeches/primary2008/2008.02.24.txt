our economi ha been struggl for some time now __PUNCT__
and as i travel across ohio __PUNCT__ i seen the face of thi economi __PUNCT__ a mother who told me she can't afford health care for her sick child __PUNCT__ a father who worri he won't be abl to send hi children to colleg __PUNCT__ and senior who seen their pension disappear becaus the compani thei gave their live to went bankrupt __PUNCT__
i don't have to tell you about thi __PUNCT__
folk around here have been directli impact by the chang in our economi __PUNCT__ whether it wa the loss of steel job over the past few decad __PUNCT__ or the close of the ford plant that wa here for so long __PUNCT__
and folk in thi area ar still worri about whether thei go to lose their job and how thei go to make end meet if that happen __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if we honest with ourselv __PUNCT__ we acknowledg that we can't stop global in it track and that some of these job aren't come back __PUNCT__
but what i refus to accept is that we have to stand idli by while worker watch their job get ship oversea __PUNCT__
we need a presid who work as hard for you as you work for your famili __PUNCT__
and that the kind of presid i intend to be __PUNCT__
i propos a job __PUNCT__ creation agenda that start with make sure trade work for american worker __PUNCT__
we can't keep pass unfair trade deal like nafta that put special interest over worker __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ senat clinton ha been go to great length on the campaign trail to distanc herself from nafta __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ she said nafta wa __PUNCT__ negoti __PUNCT__ by the first presid bush __PUNCT__ not by her husband __PUNCT__
but let be clear __PUNCT__ it wa her husband who got nafta pass __PUNCT__
in her own book __PUNCT__ senat clinton call nafta on of __PUNCT__ bill success __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ legisl victori __PUNCT__
and yesterdai __PUNCT__ senat clinton also said i wrong to point out that she onc support nafta __PUNCT__
but the fact is __PUNCT__ she wa sai great thing about nafta until she start run for presid __PUNCT__
a coupl year after it pass __PUNCT__ she said nafta wa a __PUNCT__ free and fair trade agreement __PUNCT__ and that it wa __PUNCT__ prove it worth __PUNCT__
and in __NUM__ she said __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ on balanc __PUNCT__ nafta ha been good for new york and america __PUNCT__
on million job have been lost becaus of nafta __PUNCT__ includ nearli __NUM__ job here in ohio __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ ten year after nafta pass __PUNCT__ senat clinton said it wa good for america __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i don't think nafta ha been good for america __PUNCT__ and i never have __PUNCT__
i didn't just start critic unfair trade deal like nafta becaus i start run for offic __PUNCT__ i do it becaus i seen what happen to a commun when the factori close down and the job move oversea __PUNCT__
i began my career as a commun organ on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ fight jobless and poverti in neighborhood that were devast when the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
and it becaus of thi longstand commit to work famili that i will not sign ani trade agreement as presid that doe not have protect for our environ and protect for american worker __PUNCT__
and i pass the patriot employ act that i been fight for ever sinc i ran for the senat so we can end tax break for compani that ship our job oversea __PUNCT__ and give those break to compani that creat good job with decent wage here in america __PUNCT__
it also time to let our union do what thei do best __PUNCT__ organ our worker __PUNCT__
if a major of worker want a union __PUNCT__ thei should get a union __PUNCT__
it that simpl __PUNCT__
we need to stand up to the busi lobbi __PUNCT__ and pass the employe free choic act __PUNCT__
that why i been fight for it in the senat __PUNCT__ and that why i make it the law of the land when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we can also invest in american job by invest in america __PUNCT__ and rebuild our road and bridg __PUNCT__
i propos a nation infrastructur reinvest bank that will invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year __PUNCT__
thi will multipli into almost half a trillion dollar of addit infrastructur spend and gener nearli two million new job __PUNCT__ mani of them in the construct industri that been hard hit by the hous crisi we face __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ we also got to do more to creat the green job that ar job of the futur __PUNCT__
my energi plan will put __MONEY__ billion over ten year into establish a green energi sector that will creat up to __NUM__ million new job over the next two decad __PUNCT__ includ job right here in ohio that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
we also provid fund to help manufactur convert to green technolog and help worker learn the skill thei need for these job __PUNCT__
we know that all of thi must be done in a respons wai __PUNCT__ without ad to the alreadi obscen debt that ha grown by four trillion dollar under georg bush __PUNCT__
we cannot build our futur on a credit card issu by the bank of china __PUNCT__
and that is why i pai for everi part of thi job __PUNCT__ creation agenda __PUNCT__ by end thi war in iraq that cost us billion __PUNCT__ close tax loophol for corpor __PUNCT__ put a price on carbon pollut __PUNCT__ and end georg bush tax cut for the wealthiest american __PUNCT__
but in the end __PUNCT__ enact thi agenda won't just requir an invest __PUNCT__
it will requir a new spirit of cooper __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ and share sacrific __PUNCT__
we have to remind ourselv that we rise and fall as on nation __PUNCT__ that a countri in which onli a few prosper is antithet to our ideal and our democraci __PUNCT__ and that those of us who have benefit greatli from the bless of thi countri have a solemn oblig to open the door of opportun __PUNCT__ not just for our children __PUNCT__ but to all of america children __PUNCT__
that the kind of vision i have for thi countri __PUNCT__ and that the kind of vision i hope to make real as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
