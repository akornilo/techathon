when i began thi campaign for the presid __PUNCT__ i said i wa run becaus i believ that the size of our challeng had outgrown the small of our polit in washington __PUNCT__ the petti and the game __PUNCT__ plai and the influenc __PUNCT__ peddl that alwai prevent us from solv the problem we face year after year after year __PUNCT__
i ran becaus i believ that thi year __PUNCT__ that thi moment __PUNCT__ wa too import to let that happen again __PUNCT__
and i had faith that you believ that too __PUNCT__ that you were readi for someth differ __PUNCT__ that you were hungri for someth new __PUNCT__
fifteen month later __PUNCT__ we alreadi do what none of the cynic in washington thought we could do __PUNCT__
in the face of a polit that tri to divid us and distract us and make thi campaign about who up and who down and who __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ about __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ we built a movement of american from everi race and region and parti who desper want chang in washington __PUNCT__
i have no illus about how far we have to go __PUNCT__
our road is still long __PUNCT__
our climb is still steep __PUNCT__
but fifteen month later __PUNCT__ i also know that our mission is even more urgent becaus the challeng face peopl across indiana and the countri ar grow by the dai __PUNCT__
i not tell you anyth you don't know __PUNCT__
you don't have to turn on the new or follow the stock ticker or wait for all the economist and politician to agre on what is or is not a recess to know that our economi is in seriou troubl __PUNCT__
you can feel it in your own live __PUNCT__
and i hear it everywher i go __PUNCT__
like the young man i met in pennsylvania who lost hi job but can't afford the ga to drive around and look for a new on __PUNCT__
or the woman from anderson who just lost her job __PUNCT__ and her pension __PUNCT__ and her insur when the delphi plant close down __PUNCT__ even while the top execut walk awai with multi __PUNCT__ million __PUNCT__ dollar bonus __PUNCT__
or the famili across thi countri who will sit around the kitchen tabl tonight and wonder whether next week paycheck will be enough to cover next month bill __PUNCT__ who will look at their children without know if thei be abl to give them the same chanc that thei had __PUNCT__
but here what washington and wall street don't get __PUNCT__
thi economi doesn't just jeopard our financi well __PUNCT__ be __PUNCT__ it offend the most basic valu that have made thi countri what it is __PUNCT__ the idea that america is the place where you can make it if you try __PUNCT__
that no matter how much monei you start with or where you come from or who your parent ar __PUNCT__ opportun is your if you will to reach for it and work for it __PUNCT__
it the idea that while there ar no guarante in life __PUNCT__ you should abl to count on a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ health care for when you get sick __PUNCT__ a pension for when you retir __PUNCT__ an educ for your children that will allow them to fulfil their god __PUNCT__ given potenti __PUNCT__
that who we ar as a countri __PUNCT__
that the america most of us here know __PUNCT__
it the america our parent and our grandpar grew up know __PUNCT__
thi is the countri that gave my grandfath a chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill when he came home from world war ii __PUNCT__ a countri that gave him and my grandmoth __PUNCT__ a small __PUNCT__ town coupl from kansa __PUNCT__ the chanc to bui their first home with a loan from the govern __PUNCT__
thi is the countri that made it possibl for my mother __PUNCT__ a singl parent who had to go on food stamp at on point __PUNCT__ to send my sister and me to the best school in the countri with the help of scholarship __PUNCT__
thi is the countri that allow my father __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ a citi worker at a south side water filtrat plant __PUNCT__ to provid for hi wife and two children on a singl salari __PUNCT__
thi is a man who wa diagnos at ag thirti with multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__ who reli on a walker to get himself to work __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ everi dai he went __PUNCT__ and he labor __PUNCT__ and he sent my wife and her brother to on of the best colleg in the nation __PUNCT__
that job didn't just give him a paycheck __PUNCT__ it gave him digniti and self __PUNCT__ worth __PUNCT__
it wa an america that didn't just reward and honor wealth __PUNCT__ but the work and the worker who help creat it __PUNCT__
and we ar here todai look for the answer to the same question __PUNCT__
where is that america todai __PUNCT__
how mani veteran come home from thi war without the care thei need __PUNCT__ how mani wander the street of the richest countri on earth without a roof over their head __PUNCT__ how mani singl parent can't even afford to send their children to the doctor when thei get sick __PUNCT__ never mind to four year of colleg __PUNCT__ how mani worker have suffer the indign of have to compet with their own children for a minimum wage job at mcdonald after thei gave their live to a compani where the ceo just walk off with that multi __PUNCT__ million dollar bonu __PUNCT__
and most of all __PUNCT__ how mani year __PUNCT__ how mani decad __PUNCT__ have we talk and talk and talk about these problem while washington ha done noth __PUNCT__ or tinker __PUNCT__ or made them wors __PUNCT__
there is no doubt that mani of these challeng have to do with fundament shift in our economi that began decad ago __PUNCT__ chang that have torn down border and barrier and allow compani to send job wherev there a cheap sourc of labor __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ with countri like china and india educ their children longer and better __PUNCT__ and revolut in commun and technolog __PUNCT__ thei can send the job wherev there an internet connect __PUNCT__
i saw the begin of these chang up close when i move to the south side of chicago more than two decad ago to help neighborhood that were devast when the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
i saw the indign of jobless and the hopeless of lost opportun __PUNCT__
but i also saw that we ar not powerless in the face of these challeng __PUNCT__
we don't have to sit here and watch our leader do noth __PUNCT__
i learn that we don't have to consign our children to a futur of diminish dream __PUNCT__ a futur of fewer opportun __PUNCT__
and that why i run for presid todai __PUNCT__
polit didn't lead me to work peopl __PUNCT__ work peopl led me to polit __PUNCT__
i run becaus we can't afford to settl for a washington where john mccain get the chanc to give us four more year of the same bush polici that have fail us for the last eight __PUNCT__
more tax break for ceo who make more in a dai than some worker make in a year __PUNCT__
more tax break for the same corpor that ship our job oversea __PUNCT__
more of the trickl __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ your __PUNCT__ own philosophi that sai there noth govern can do about the problem we face __PUNCT__ so we might as well just hand out a few tax break and tell peopl to bui their own health care __PUNCT__ their own educ __PUNCT__ their own road __PUNCT__ their own bridg __PUNCT__
that hasn't work in the past __PUNCT__ and it won't work for our futur __PUNCT__
we can't afford to settl for a washington where our energi polici __PUNCT__ and our health care polici __PUNCT__ and our tax polici is sold to the highest __PUNCT__ bid lobbyist __PUNCT__
we can't keep take thousand of dollar of their monei year after year __PUNCT__ elect after elect __PUNCT__
senat clinton sai thei repres real american __PUNCT__ but you and i know who thei realli repres __PUNCT__ the oil compani and the drug compani and the insur compani who keep us from bring down the cost of our premium and our prescript and invest in renew fuel __PUNCT__
we can't afford to settl for a washington where politician onli focu on how to win instead of why we should __PUNCT__ where thei check the poll befor thei check their gut __PUNCT__ where thei onli tell us whatev we want to hear whenev we want to hear it __PUNCT__
that kind of polit mai get them where thei need to go __PUNCT__ but it doesn't get america where we need to go __PUNCT__
and it won't chang anyth __PUNCT__
some of you might have seen that senat clinton spend a lot of monei on a televis ad that attack me for not support her and john mccain idea of a ga tax holidai for the summer __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ thi is an idea that will save you __PUNCT__ altogeth __PUNCT__ half a tank of ga __PUNCT__
that thirti cent a dai __PUNCT__
for three month __PUNCT__
that if the oil compani don't simpli jack up their price to fill the gap __PUNCT__ as thei done when thi wa tri befor __PUNCT__
doe anyon here realli trust the oil compani to give you the save when thei could just pocket the monei themselv __PUNCT__
it a shell game __PUNCT__
liter __PUNCT__
in a moment of candor __PUNCT__ her advisor actual admit that it wouldn't have much of an effect on ga price __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ it a great polit issu for senat clinton __PUNCT__
so thi is not about get you through the summer __PUNCT__ it about get elect __PUNCT__
and thi is what pass for leadership in washington __PUNCT__ phoni idea __PUNCT__ calcul to win elect instead of actual solv problem __PUNCT__
now senat clinton been us thi issu to make the argument that i somehow __PUNCT__ out of touch __PUNCT__
well let me tell you __PUNCT__ onli in washington can you get awai with call someon out of touch when you the on who think that thirti cent a dai is enough to help peopl who ar struggl in thi economi __PUNCT__
i tell you what i think __PUNCT__ i think the american peopl ar smarter than washington give us credit for __PUNCT__
i wish i could stand up here and tell you that we could fix our energi problem with a holidai __PUNCT__
i wish i could tell you that we can take a time __PUNCT__ out from trade and bring back the job that have gone oversea __PUNCT__
i wish i could promis that on dai on of my presid __PUNCT__ i could pass everi plan and propos i outlin in thi campaign __PUNCT__
but my guess is that you heard those promis befor __PUNCT__
you hear them everi year __PUNCT__ in everi elect __PUNCT__
and afterward __PUNCT__ when everyon goe back to washington __PUNCT__ the game __PUNCT__ plai __PUNCT__ and the influenc __PUNCT__ peddl __PUNCT__ and the petti bicker continu __PUNCT__
noth get done __PUNCT__
and four year later __PUNCT__ we right back here make the veri same promis about the veri same problem __PUNCT__
well thi year you have a choic __PUNCT__
if you want to take anoth chanc on the same kind of polit we come to know in washington __PUNCT__ there ar other candid to choos from __PUNCT__
but i still believ we need to fundament chang washington if we want chang in america __PUNCT__
i still believ thi elect is bigger than me __PUNCT__ or senat clinton __PUNCT__ or senat mccain __PUNCT__
it bigger than democrat versu republican __PUNCT__
it about who we ar as american __PUNCT__
it about whether thi countri __PUNCT__ at thi moment __PUNCT__ will continu to stand by while the wealthi few prosper at the expens of the hardwork mani __PUNCT__ or whether we stand up and reclaim the american dream for everi american __PUNCT__
it about whether we watch the china and the india of the world move past us __PUNCT__ or whether we decid that in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ the home of innov __PUNCT__ and discoveri __PUNCT__ and progress will still be the unit state of america __PUNCT__
reclaim thi dream will take more than on elect __PUNCT__
it will take more than on person or on parti __PUNCT__
it will take the effort and sacrific of a nation unit __PUNCT__
and that the truth __PUNCT__
we can provid relief that more than a holidai to famili who ar struggl in thi economi __PUNCT__
i the onli candid who propos a genuin middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut that paid for in part by close corpor loophol and shut down tax haven __PUNCT__
it would save nearli everi work famili __MONEY__ elimin incom tax for senior make under __MONEY__ and provid a mortgag tax credit to struggl homeown that would cover ten percent of their mortgag interest payment everi year __PUNCT__
i also have a health care plan that would save the averag famili __MONEY__ on their premium and provid the uninsur with the same kind of health care member of congress give themselv __PUNCT__
that real relief __PUNCT__ but we can onli pai for thi if we final rollback the bush tax cut for the wealthiest __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of american who don't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
we mai not be abl to bring back all the job that we lost to trade __PUNCT__ but we can creat tomorrow job in thi countri __PUNCT__
i happen to believ in free trade __PUNCT__
but we do the caus of trade no favor when we pass agreement that ar fill with perk for everi special interest under the sun and absolut no protect for american worker __PUNCT__
there absolut no reason we should be give tax break to corpor who ship job oversea __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ i will elimin those tax break and give them to compani who creat good job right here in america __PUNCT__
we can also creat job if we final get seriou about rebuild our crumbl and decai nation infrastructur __PUNCT__
a few year ago __PUNCT__ on out of three urban bridg were classifi as structur defici __PUNCT__ and we all saw the tragic result of what that could mean in minnesota last year __PUNCT__
it unaccept __PUNCT__
that why i propos a nation infrastructur reinvest bank that will invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year and gener nearli two million new job __PUNCT__ mani of them in the construct industri that been hard hit by thi hous crisi __PUNCT__
the repair will be determin not by polit __PUNCT__ but by what will maxim our safeti __PUNCT__
and we fund thi bank by end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__
it time to stop spend billion of dollar a week try to put iraq back togeth and start spend the monei on put america back togeth instead __PUNCT__
and if want to take a perman holidai from our oil addict __PUNCT__ we can final get seriou about energi independ and creat five million new green job in the process __PUNCT__ job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
we do what i did when i went to detroit and tell the automak it time thei rais fuel mileag standard in thi countri __PUNCT__
we make compani pai for the pollut thei releas into the air __PUNCT__ we tax the record profit of the oil compani __PUNCT__ and we us that monei to invest in clean __PUNCT__ afford __PUNCT__ renew energi like solar power __PUNCT__ and wind power __PUNCT__ and biofuel __PUNCT__
i be honest __PUNCT__ thi transit to a green economi won't come without cost that all of us will have to pai __PUNCT__ but it the onli wai we free ourselv from the whim of middl east dictat __PUNCT__ the onli wai we make sure we not talk about high ga price five year from now and ten year from now __PUNCT__ the onli wai we can pass on a planet that still recogniz to our children and their children __PUNCT__
and if we want our children to succe in thi global economi __PUNCT__ if we want them to be abl to compet with children in beij and bangalor __PUNCT__ then we need to make sure that everi child __PUNCT__ everywher get a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ from the dai thei born until the dai thei graduat colleg __PUNCT__
that mean invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
it mean that we need to recruit an armi of new teacher by not just talk about how great teacher ar __PUNCT__ but reward them for their great with better pai and more support __PUNCT__
and it mean that in thi countri __PUNCT__ in thi global economi __PUNCT__ we will not creat a small class of the educ few by allow thousand and thousand of young peopl to be price out of colleg year after year __PUNCT__
we ar better than that __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we creat a bargain with everi american who want to go to colleg __PUNCT__ we will pai for your tuition if you serv your countri in some wai for two year after you graduat __PUNCT__
real relief for middl __PUNCT__ class famili __PUNCT__ senior __PUNCT__ and homeown __PUNCT__
lower premium for those who have health care and coverag for everyon who want it __PUNCT__
five million green job right here in america __PUNCT__
a world __PUNCT__ class educ that will allow everi american to reach their god __PUNCT__ given potenti and compet with ani worker in the world __PUNCT__
all of thi is possibl __PUNCT__ but it just a list of polici until you decid that it time to make the washington we have look like the america we know __PUNCT__ on where the futur is not determin by those with monei and influenc __PUNCT__ where common sens and honesti ar cherish valu __PUNCT__ where we ar stronger than that which divid us becaus we realiz that in the end __PUNCT__ we rise or fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
it wa forti year ago thi mai that robert kennedi took hi unlik campaign to creat a new kind of polit to indiana __PUNCT__
and as he campaign in fort wayn __PUNCT__ he laid out a vision that america we know __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ incom and educ and home do not make a nation __PUNCT__
nor do land and border __PUNCT__
share ideal and principl __PUNCT__ join purpos and hope __PUNCT__ these make a nation __PUNCT__
and that is our great task __PUNCT__
it is still our task todai __PUNCT__
we alwai known thi wouldn't be easi __PUNCT__
the chang we look for never is __PUNCT__
gener befor us have fought war and revolut __PUNCT__ thei struggl and thei sacrif __PUNCT__ thei stood up and spoke out and march through the street for the opportun that we enjoi __PUNCT__
and that why the onli wai a black gui name barack obama who wa born in hawaii __PUNCT__ and start hi career on the street of chicago __PUNCT__ can win thi race __PUNCT__ if you decid that you had enough of the wai thing ar __PUNCT__ if you decid that thi elect is bigger than flag pin and sniper fire and the comment of a former pastor __PUNCT__ bigger than the differ between what we look like or where we come from or what parti we belong to __PUNCT__
and if you do __PUNCT__ if you decid that thi moment is about what kind of countri we be in the next year and the next centuri __PUNCT__ about how we provid job to the jobless and opportun to those without it __PUNCT__ about health care and good school and a green planet __PUNCT__ about give our children a better world and a brighter futur __PUNCT__ then i ask you to enlist your neighbor __PUNCT__ and knock on door __PUNCT__ and work your heart out from now until tuesdai __PUNCT__
in the face of all cynic __PUNCT__ and doubt __PUNCT__ and fear __PUNCT__ i ask you to rememb what make a nation __PUNCT__ and to believ that we can onc again make thi nation the land of limitless possibl and unyield hope __PUNCT__ the place where you can still make it if you try __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
