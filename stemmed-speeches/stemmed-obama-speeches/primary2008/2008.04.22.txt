and now __PUNCT__ six week later __PUNCT__ we close the gap __PUNCT__
we ralli peopl of everi ag and race and background to our caus __PUNCT__
and whether thei were inspir for the first time or for the first time in a long time __PUNCT__ we regist a record number of voter who will lead our parti to victori in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
these american cast their ballot for the same reason you came here tonight __PUNCT__ for the same reason that million of american have gone door __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ door and given whatev small amount thei can to thi campaign __PUNCT__ for the same reason that we began thi journei just a few hundr mile from here on a cold __DATE__ morn in springfield __PUNCT__ becaus we believ that the challeng we face ar bigger than the small of our polit __PUNCT__ and we know that thi elect is our chanc to chang it __PUNCT__
after fourteen long month __PUNCT__ it easi to forget thi from time to time __PUNCT__ to lose sight of the fierc urgenc of thi moment __PUNCT__
it easi to get caught up in the distract and the silli and the tit __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__ tat that consum our polit __PUNCT__ the bicker that none of us ar immun to __PUNCT__ and that trivial the profound issu __PUNCT__ two war __PUNCT__ an economi in recess __PUNCT__ a planet in peril __PUNCT__
but that kind of polit is not why we here __PUNCT__
it not why i here and it not why you here __PUNCT__
we here becaus of the more than on hundr worker in logansport __PUNCT__ indiana who just found out that their compani ha decid to move it entir factori to taiwan __PUNCT__
we here becaus of the young man i met in youngsvil __PUNCT__ north carolina who almost lost hi home becaus he ha three children with cystic fibrosi and couldn't pai their medic bill __PUNCT__ who still doesn't have health insur for himself or hi wife and live in fear that a singl ill could cost them everyth __PUNCT__
we here becaus there ar famili all across thi countri who ar sit around the kitchen tabl right now try to figur out how to pai their insur premium __PUNCT__ and their kid __PUNCT__ tuition __PUNCT__ and still make the mortgag so thei not the next on in the neighborhood to put a for sale sign in the front yard __PUNCT__ who will lai awak tonight wonder if next week paycheck will cover next month bill __PUNCT__
we not here to talk about chang for chang sake __PUNCT__ but becaus our famili __PUNCT__ our commun __PUNCT__ and our countri desper need it __PUNCT__
we here becaus we can't afford to keep do what we been do for anoth four year __PUNCT__
we can't afford to plai the same washington game with the same washington player and expect a differ result __PUNCT__
not thi time __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
we alreadi know what we get from the other parti nomine __PUNCT__
john mccain ha offer thi countri a lifetim of servic __PUNCT__ and we respect that __PUNCT__ but what he not offer is ani meaning chang from the polici of georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
john mccain believ that georg bush iraq polici is a success __PUNCT__ so he offer four more year of a war with no exit strategi __PUNCT__ a war that send our troop on their third tour __PUNCT__ and fourth tour __PUNCT__ and fifth tour of duti __PUNCT__ a war that cost us billion of dollar a month and hasn't made us ani safer __PUNCT__
john mccain said that georg bush econom polici have led to __PUNCT__ great progress __PUNCT__ over the last seven year __PUNCT__ and so he promis four more year of tax cut for ceo and corpor who didn't need them and weren't ask for them __PUNCT__ tax cut that he onc vote against becaus he said thei __PUNCT__ offend hi conscienc __PUNCT__
well thei mai have stop offend john mccain conscienc somewher along the road to the white hous __PUNCT__ but georg bush econom polici still offend our __PUNCT__
becaus i don't think that the __NUM__ american who lost their job thi year ar see the great progress that john mccain ha seen __PUNCT__
i don't think the million of american lose their home have seen that progress __PUNCT__
i don't think the famili without health care and the worker without pension have seen that progress __PUNCT__
and if we continu down the same reckless path __PUNCT__ i don't think that futur gener who be saddl with debt will see these as year of progress __PUNCT__
we alreadi know that john mccain offer more of the same __PUNCT__
the question is not whether the other parti will bring about chang in washington __PUNCT__ the question is __PUNCT__ will we __PUNCT__
becaus the truth is __PUNCT__ the challeng we face ar not just the fault of on man or on parti __PUNCT__
how mani year __PUNCT__ how mani decad __PUNCT__ have we been talk about solv our health care crisi __PUNCT__ how mani presid have promis to end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ how mani job have gone oversea in the 70 __PUNCT__ and the 80 __PUNCT__ and the 90 __PUNCT__ and we still haven't done anyth about it __PUNCT__
and we know why __PUNCT__
in everi elect __PUNCT__ politician come to your citi and your town __PUNCT__ and thei tell you what you want to hear __PUNCT__ and thei make big promis __PUNCT__ and thei lai out all these plan and polici __PUNCT__
but then thei go back to washington when the campaign over __PUNCT__
lobbyist spend million of dollar to get their wai __PUNCT__
the statu quo set in __PUNCT__
and instead of fight for health care or job __PUNCT__ washington end up fight over the latest distract of the week __PUNCT__
it happen year after year after year __PUNCT__
well thi is your chanc to sai __PUNCT__ not thi year __PUNCT__
thi is your chanc to sai __PUNCT__ not thi time __PUNCT__
we have a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can be a parti that sai there no problem with take monei from washington lobbyist __PUNCT__ from oil lobbyist and drug lobbyist and insur lobbyist __PUNCT__
we can pretend that thei repres real american and look the other wai when thei us their monei and influenc to stop us from reform health care or invest in renew energi for yet anoth four year __PUNCT__
or thi time __PUNCT__ we can recogn that you can't be the champion of work american if you fund by the lobbyist who drown out their voic __PUNCT__
we can do what we done in thi campaign __PUNCT__ and sai that we won't take a dime of their monei __PUNCT__
we can do what i did in illinoi __PUNCT__ and in washington __PUNCT__ and bring both parti togeth to rein in their power so we can take our govern back __PUNCT__
it our choic __PUNCT__
we can be a parti that think the onli wai to look tough on nation secur is to talk __PUNCT__ and act __PUNCT__ and vote like georg bush and john mccain __PUNCT__
we can us fear as a tactic __PUNCT__ and the threat of terror to scare up vote __PUNCT__
or we can decid that real strength is ask the tough question befor we send our troop to fight __PUNCT__
we can see the threat we face for what thei ar __PUNCT__ a call to ralli all american and all the world against the common challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ terror and nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ climat chang and poverti __PUNCT__ genocid and diseas __PUNCT__
that what it take to keep us safe in the world __PUNCT__
that the real legaci of roosevelt and kennedi and truman __PUNCT__
we can be a parti that sai and doe whatev it take to win the next elect __PUNCT__
we can calcul and poll __PUNCT__ test our posit and tell everyon exactli what thei want to hear __PUNCT__
or we can be the parti that doesn't just focu on how to win but why we should __PUNCT__
we can tell everyon what thei need to hear about the challeng we face __PUNCT__
we can seek to regain not just an offic __PUNCT__ but the trust of the american peopl that their leader in washington will tell them the truth __PUNCT__
that the choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can be a parti of those who onli think like we do and onli agre with all our posit __PUNCT__
we can continu to slice and dice thi countri into red state and blue state __PUNCT__
we can exploit the divis that exist in our countri for pure polit gain __PUNCT__
or thi time __PUNCT__ we can build on the movement we start in thi campaign __PUNCT__ a movement that unit democrat __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ and republican __PUNCT__ a movement of young and old __PUNCT__ rich and poor __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ and nativ american __PUNCT__
becaus on thing i know from travel to forti __PUNCT__ six state thi campaign season is that we not as divid as our polit suggest __PUNCT__
we mai have differ stori and differ background __PUNCT__ but we hold common hope for the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ thi elect is still our best chanc to solv the problem we been talk about for decad __PUNCT__ as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
fourteen month later __PUNCT__ that is still what thi elect is about __PUNCT__
million of american who believ we can do better __PUNCT__ that we must do better __PUNCT__ have put us in a posit to bring about real chang __PUNCT__
now it up to you __PUNCT__ indiana __PUNCT__
you can decid whether we go to travel the same worn path __PUNCT__ or whether we chart a new cours that offer real hope for the futur __PUNCT__
dure the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__ we all learn what my wife remind me of all the time __PUNCT__ that i am not a perfect man __PUNCT__
and i will not be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
and so while i will alwai listen to you __PUNCT__ and be honest with you __PUNCT__ and fight for you everi singl dai for the next for year __PUNCT__ i will also ask you to be a part of the chang that we need __PUNCT__
becaus in my two decad of public servic to thi countri __PUNCT__ i have seen time and time again that real chang doesn't begin in the hall of washington __PUNCT__ but on the street of america __PUNCT__
it doesn't happen from the top __PUNCT__ down __PUNCT__ it happen from the bottom __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
i also know that real chang ha never been easi __PUNCT__ and it won't be easi thi time either __PUNCT__
the statu quo in washington will fight harder than thei ever have to divid us and distract us with ad and attack from now until __DATE__ __PUNCT__
but don't ever forget that you have the power to chang thi countri __PUNCT__
you can make thi elect about how we go to help those worker in logansport __PUNCT__ how we go to re __PUNCT__ train them __PUNCT__ and educ them __PUNCT__ and make our workforc competit in a global economi __PUNCT__
you can make thi elect about how we go to make health care afford for that famili in north carolina __PUNCT__ how we go to help those famili sit around the kitchen tabl tonight pai their bill and stai in their home __PUNCT__
you can make thi elect about how we plan to leav our children and all children a planet that safer and a world that still see america the same wai my father saw it from across the ocean __PUNCT__ as a beacon of all that is good and all that is possibl for all mankind __PUNCT__
it is now our turn to follow in the footstep of all those gener who sacrif and struggl and face down the greatest odd to perfect our improb union __PUNCT__
and if we will to do what thei did __PUNCT__ if we will to shed our cynic and our doubt and our fear __PUNCT__ if we will to believ in what possibl again __PUNCT__ then i believ that we won't just win thi primari elect __PUNCT__ we won't just win thi elect in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we will chang thi countri __PUNCT__ and keep thi countri promis aliv in the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
