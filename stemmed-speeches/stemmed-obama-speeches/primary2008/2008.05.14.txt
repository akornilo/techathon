earlier todai __PUNCT__ i went for a tour of the chrysler stamp plant in sterl height __PUNCT__ and i listen to folk tell me about how hard it is to get by in thi economi __PUNCT__
and the record oil price mean that it even harder for automak and autowork __PUNCT__ especi at a time when thei struggl to meet the demand of a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
sinc the begin of thi year __PUNCT__ thousand of chrysler worker have lost their job __PUNCT__
the entir industri ha shed __NUM__ job in the past eight year __PUNCT__ about a third of which were lost in michigan __PUNCT__
that hundr of thousand of worker who will no longer be abl to count on a paycheck to pai the rise cost of health care and colleg __PUNCT__ ga and groceri __PUNCT__
and those who ar lucki enough to avoid get laid off ar still feel the pressur of restructur __PUNCT__
not too far from here __PUNCT__ at american axl __PUNCT__ uaw member have gone on strike to fight for good wage __PUNCT__ and good benefit __PUNCT__ and a decent standard of live __PUNCT__
these ar thing that all hardwork famili should expect and that uaw member deserv __PUNCT__ and we stand in solidar with the folk on the picket line __PUNCT__ and the famili impact by thi strike __PUNCT__
their struggl is part of a larger struggl that be wage not just in michigan __PUNCT__ but all across the countri __PUNCT__
it a struggl to ensur that we have good manufactur job so american worker can rais a famili __PUNCT__ have health care when thei need it __PUNCT__ put their children through colleg __PUNCT__ and retir with digniti and secur __PUNCT__
thei common hope __PUNCT__ modest dream __PUNCT__ but thei slip out of reach for too mani famili __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ a big part of the reason autowork ar struggl on the factori floor is becaus of decis that were made in the boardroom __PUNCT__
rather than invest in the fuel __PUNCT__ effici car of the futur __PUNCT__ auto execut invest in the suv and larg truck that mai have help meet a rise demand __PUNCT__ but that essenti guarante that thei would be outpac by foreign competitor and that the industri long __PUNCT__ term problem would be harder to solv __PUNCT__
but american automak have been show leadership in recent year __PUNCT__
ford ha now ti toyota in the qualiti of the car thei make __PUNCT__ and thei spend more on r&d than nearli ani other compani in the world __PUNCT__
chrysler is work to develop a system that integr electr motor with a fix __PUNCT__ gear transmiss __PUNCT__
and gm is releas an averag of on new hybrid model everi three month for the next two year __PUNCT__
so we certainli take step in the right direct __PUNCT__
but we must do more __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ we will __PUNCT__
we won't just support the autowork in michigan who built the auto industri __PUNCT__ and keep it strong in good time and bad __PUNCT__
and we won't just reviv and strengthen our automak __PUNCT__
we reviv and strengthen all of american manufactur __PUNCT__
these have been a disastr eight year for our manufactur __PUNCT__
we lost nearli __NUM__ million good __PUNCT__ pai job __PUNCT__ includ hundr of thousand in michigan __PUNCT__ and more than __NUM__ manufactur have close their door __PUNCT__
we can't afford to continu down thi path __PUNCT__
manufactur support on in six american job __PUNCT__ job that pai more and offer better benefit than other job __PUNCT__ and we all have a stake in save them __PUNCT__
it time to recaptur the spirit of innov that ha alwai fuel america econom success __PUNCT__
it time we had an economi that wa driven not just by foreign debt __PUNCT__ but by the power of america imagin __PUNCT__
it time to tap the ingenu of engin and entrepreneur __PUNCT__ polici expert and work folk to meet the challeng of our time __PUNCT__
that what thi elect is all about __PUNCT__
so while thi is a moment of challeng __PUNCT__ it also a moment of opportun __PUNCT__
and the question you face in __DATE__ is which candid can lead america to seiz it __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ when john mccain came to michigan in __DATE__ and said that we couldn't bring all these job back to america __PUNCT__ he wa right __PUNCT__
but where he wrong is in suggest that there noth we can do to replac those job or creat new on __PUNCT__
where he wrong is in not offer new solut or econom polici that ar differ from what georg bush ha given us for eight long year __PUNCT__
that wrong __PUNCT__
that give up __PUNCT__
and that not what thi countri is about __PUNCT__
i won't stand here and tell you that we be abl to stop everi job from go oversea or bring everi job back __PUNCT__
but i will tell you that we can end the bush __PUNCT__ mccain polici of give tax break to compani that ship our job oversea __PUNCT__ and we can start give those tax break to compani that creat good __PUNCT__ pai job right here in america __PUNCT__
instead of oppos job train similar to what be offer at m __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ like john mccain ha __PUNCT__ we can make sure everi american ha the skill to compet in the global economi __PUNCT__
we don't have to stand idli by while foreign competitor outpac us in make the car of the futur __PUNCT__
i run for presid to make sure that the car of the futur ar made where thei alwai been made __PUNCT__ right here in michigan __PUNCT__
becaus the fight for american manufactur is the fight for america futur __PUNCT__ and i believ that a fight thi countri will win __PUNCT__
and so todai __PUNCT__ i announc a manufactur agenda that will lift up hardwork famili __PUNCT__ strengthen innov compani __PUNCT__ and foster our common prosper __PUNCT__
the first part of thi agenda is invest in clean energi __PUNCT__ becaus that isn't just how we get ga price under control __PUNCT__ combat climat chang __PUNCT__ and free ourselv from the tyranni of oil __PUNCT__ it also how we expand american manufactur __PUNCT__ creat qualiti job __PUNCT__ and grow our economi __PUNCT__
that why i invest __MONEY__ billion over the next ten year in the green energi sector __PUNCT__
thi will creat up to five million new green job __PUNCT__ and those ar job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
and i be a presid who final keep the promis that made year after year after year by provid domest automak with the fund thei need to retool their factori and make fuel __PUNCT__ effici and altern fuel car __PUNCT__
my own state of illinoi is home to the oldest __PUNCT__ continu oper ford assembl plant outsid michigan __PUNCT__ so i understand why it so import to bring our auto industri into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and that what we do when i presid __PUNCT__
here what els we do __PUNCT__
we invest __MONEY__ billion a year in creat a clean technolog deploy ventur capit fund that will meet a critic need __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of north america automot research is done right here in michigan __PUNCT__
but too often __PUNCT__ breakthrough technolog that ar invent in america end up get built oversea becaus of the cost of get these new technolog commerci __PUNCT__
thi govern __PUNCT__ back fund will help solv thi problem by creat an initi right here in michigan that will acceler the develop and deploy of cut __PUNCT__ edg vehicl technolog __PUNCT__
to take on exampl __PUNCT__ thi fund will help american compani build batteri for plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid vehicl so we don't have to bui them from abroad __PUNCT__
that how we make sure american automak continu to lead the world __PUNCT__ and that how we make sure that american manufactur don't just surviv __PUNCT__ but actual thrive in thi centuri __PUNCT__
the second part of my agenda is make sure that manufactur ar get the support thei need from washington __PUNCT__
here in michigan __PUNCT__ you got the michigan __NUM__ centuri job fund __PUNCT__ a state initi to help busi with the most innov propos creat new product and job in thi state __PUNCT__
i believ that an approach we need to replic across the countri __PUNCT__
and that what i do as presid by creat an advanc manufactur fund that will invest in innov and job creation in place that have been hard hit by the declin in manufactur __PUNCT__
we also make the research and develop tax credit perman so we can encourag compani to do their research and creat job right here in america __PUNCT__
and we stop slash fund for the manufactur extens partnership __PUNCT__ and start doubl it __PUNCT__
thi program help creat and protect over __NUM__ job in __NUM__ alon __PUNCT__ and ha been proven to increas the product of small and midsiz manufactur by up to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that the kind of smart invest that will help us rebuild american manufactur and make america more competit __PUNCT__
the third thing we do is invest in america long __PUNCT__ term competit by put a colleg degre within reach for all american and by help commun colleg like macomb develop associ degre program in green technolog to help make sure the next gener of worker have the skill thei need to build the car of the futur __PUNCT__
and we final solv our health care crisi onc and for all __PUNCT__
thi is a crisi that not onli leav __NUM__ million american without health insur and million more struggl to pai rise cost __PUNCT__
it also hamper our econom competit __PUNCT__
we all heard how health care account for about __MONEY__ of everi car that made in america __PUNCT__
we have to chang that __PUNCT__
that why unlik john mccain __PUNCT__ i have a univers health care plan __PUNCT__
it a plan that will cut health care cost by up to __MONEY__ per famili per year and reduc cost for busi and their worker by pick up the tab for some of the most expens ill and condit __PUNCT__
and we not go to do it twenti year from now __PUNCT__ or ten year from now __PUNCT__ we go to do it by the end of my first term as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ if we want to fight for manufactur here at home __PUNCT__ we have to fight for them around the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i believ in trade __PUNCT__ but i also believ that for america to compet and win in the global economi __PUNCT__ trade ha to work for all american __PUNCT__
that mean make sure that our worker ar compet on a level plai field __PUNCT__ and that countri like china aren't break the rule and put american worker at a disadvantag __PUNCT__
fight for our worker isn't bad for busi __PUNCT__ it good for our economi __PUNCT__
and it how we make sure that the cost and benefit of our global economi ar be share more fairli __PUNCT__
so the american peopl will have a clear choic in __DATE__ when i the nomine __PUNCT__ it a choic between more of the same fail bush polici that have done noth but harm to american manufactur over the last eight year __PUNCT__ and real chang that will help write a new chapter in the stori of american manufactur __PUNCT__
for the sake of our famili __PUNCT__ our economi __PUNCT__ and our leadership in the world __PUNCT__ we have to renew the promis of american manufactur __PUNCT__
