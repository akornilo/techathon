we meet here at a challeng time for our famili and a challeng time for america __PUNCT__
all across the countri __PUNCT__ american ar anxiou about their futur __PUNCT__
in a global economi with new rule and new risk __PUNCT__ thei watch their govern do it best to try and shift those risk onto the back of the american worker __PUNCT__
and thei wonder how thei will ever keep up __PUNCT__
in coffe shop and town meet __PUNCT__ in vfw hall and right here in thi room __PUNCT__ the question ar all the same __PUNCT__ will i be abl to leav my children a better world than i wa given __PUNCT__ will i be abl to save enough to send them to colleg or plan for a secur retir __PUNCT__ will my job even be there tomorrow __PUNCT__ who will stand up for me in thi new world __PUNCT__
in thi time of chang and uncertainti __PUNCT__ these question ar expect __PUNCT__ but thi isn't the first time we heard them __PUNCT__
these ar the same kind of question i heard over two decad ago after i turn down a job on wall street and went to work as a commun organ on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__
the job wa to help lift up neighborhood that had been devast by the close of local steel plant __PUNCT__
so i work with union and the citi govern to organ job __PUNCT__ train for the jobless and hope for the hopeless __PUNCT__ and block by block __PUNCT__ we turn those neighborhood around __PUNCT__
it show me the fundament truth that been at the heart of america success __PUNCT__ and at the heart of the labor movement in thi countri __PUNCT__ the idea that we all have mutual oblig to on anoth __PUNCT__ that i am my brother keeper __PUNCT__ i am my sister keeper __PUNCT__ and that in thi countri __PUNCT__ we rise and fall togeth __PUNCT__
but we know that for the past seven and a half year __PUNCT__ we had a whole differ philosophi in the white hous __PUNCT__
thei call it the ownership societi __PUNCT__ but what it mean is you on your own __PUNCT__
you a worker who been laid off from a job __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
you a singl mom try to find health care for your kid __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
you a senior whose pension got dump after a lifetim of hard work __PUNCT__ tough luck __PUNCT__ you on your own __PUNCT__
it not just that thi administr hasn't been fight for you __PUNCT__ thei actual tri to stop you from fight for yourselv __PUNCT__
thi is the most anti __PUNCT__ labor administr in our memori __PUNCT__
thei don't believ in union __PUNCT__
thei don't believ in organ __PUNCT__
thei pack the labor relat board with their corpor buddi __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we got new for them __PUNCT__ it not the depart of manag __PUNCT__ it the depart of labor __PUNCT__ and we here to take it back __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ john mccain seem to think the bush year have been pretti good becaus he offer more of the same __PUNCT__
and todai a good remind of that becaus it tax dai __PUNCT__
thi is suppos to be a dai when we pai what we ow to the govern __PUNCT__
but it becom a dai when georg bush washington reward it friend on wall street __PUNCT__
john mccain us to oppos the bush tax cut __PUNCT__
he us to sai that he couldn't support a tax cut where __PUNCT__ so mani of the benefit go to the most fortun __PUNCT__ he us to sai that tax cut in a time of war were a bad idea __PUNCT__ and that thei violat hi __PUNCT__ conscienc __PUNCT__ but somewher along the wai to the republican nomin __PUNCT__ i guess he figur that he had to stop speak hi mind and start tow the line __PUNCT__ becaus now he want to make those tax cut perman __PUNCT__
so i respect senat mccain __PUNCT__
and i honor hi servic to thi nation __PUNCT__
but i don't think america can afford four more year of the fail bush polici __PUNCT__ and that what he offer __PUNCT__
we need to roll back the bush __PUNCT__ mccain tax cut and invest in thing like health care that ar realli import __PUNCT__
instead of give tax break to the wealthi who don't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__ we should be put a middl class tax cut into the pocket of work famili __PUNCT__
that why i the onli candid in thi race who propos a tax cut that would save our famili __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ and elimin incom tax entir for senior make less than __MONEY__
but let me be clear __PUNCT__ thi isn't just about end the fail polici of the bush year __PUNCT__ it about end the fail system in washington that produc those polici __PUNCT__
for far too long __PUNCT__ through both democrat and republican administr __PUNCT__ washington ha allow wall street to us lobbyist and campaign contribut to rig the system and get it wai __PUNCT__ no matter what it cost ordinari american __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__
the top mortgag lender spend __MONEY__ million lobbi congress __PUNCT__ and we wonder why washington look the other wai when thei were trick famili into bui home thei couldn't afford __PUNCT__
drug and insur compani spend __MONEY__ billion on lobbi __PUNCT__ and we wonder why the cost of health care continu to shoot up __PUNCT__
when georg bush put dick chenei in charg of energi polici __PUNCT__ chenei met with the environmentalist group onc __PUNCT__ he met with the renew energi group onc __PUNCT__ and he met with the oil and ga compani forti time __PUNCT__
so it no wonder exxon mobil is make __MONEY__ billion a quarter when you pai close to __MONEY__ a gallon for ga __PUNCT__
we need a presid who think about not just wall street __PUNCT__ but main street __PUNCT__ who not just look to bump up a corpor bottom line __PUNCT__ but to do what right for the american peopl __PUNCT__
becaus that the onli wai we go to bring about real chang __PUNCT__ chang that will make a last differ in the live of ordinari american __PUNCT__
i believ i can bring about that chang __PUNCT__ becaus i the onli candid in thi race who actual work to rein in the power of lobbyist by pass histor ethic reform in illinoi and in the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
and i the onli candid who isn't take a dime from washington lobbyist and pac __PUNCT__
thei have not fund my campaign __PUNCT__ thei will not run my administr __PUNCT__ and thei will not drown out the voic of the american peopl __PUNCT__ of work peopl __PUNCT__ of union when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
your voic will be heard __PUNCT__
if you have ani doubt __PUNCT__ you can ask the union leader in illinoi __PUNCT__
when i wa home talk to some of the local leader there a coupl of year ago __PUNCT__ thei told me thei were be underbid on project becaus unscrupul builder were game the system __PUNCT__
and i listen __PUNCT__
thei said that on some construct job __PUNCT__ those builder were call their employe __PUNCT__ independ contractor __PUNCT__ to get out of have to pai employ tax and worker comp or overtim __PUNCT__
that didn't sound right to me __PUNCT__
so i set about lead an effort with senat durbin __PUNCT__ senat kennedi and other in the senat to end thi practic __PUNCT__
becaus if you do the same work as other employe __PUNCT__ you should have worker protect __PUNCT__ the same abil to organ __PUNCT__ and the same wage and benefit __PUNCT__
and i fight to make that the law of the land when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
we make sure washington serv nobodi interest but the peopl __PUNCT__
becaus i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but i tire of plai defens __PUNCT__
i readi to plai some offens __PUNCT__
i know the build and construct trade ar readi to plai offens __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for the minimum wage __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for retir secur __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for univers health care __PUNCT__
it time we stood up to the drug and insur compani who been block reform for too long and tell them enough is enough __PUNCT__
i refus to accept that in the richest nation on earth __PUNCT__ we have to stand by while __NUM__ million american go without health insur __PUNCT__ and million more ar be driven to financi ruin try to pai their medic bill __PUNCT__
i tire of see union member have to spend all their time negoti about the health care thei alreadi have when thei should be negoti for better wage that can support their famili __PUNCT__
we go to chang that __PUNCT__
we go to work with employ who ar provid health care for their employe and lower premium by up to __MONEY__ per famili per year __PUNCT__
and for those who don't have health care __PUNCT__ we go to set up a plan that as good as the on i have as a member of congress __PUNCT__
and we not go to do it twenti year from now __PUNCT__ or ten year from now __PUNCT__
we go to do it by the end of my first term as presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for work american __PUNCT__
we need to make sure worker build america infrastructur ar make the prevail wage and get the benefit thei deserv __PUNCT__
after katrina __PUNCT__ georg bush suspend davi __PUNCT__ bacon __PUNCT__
famili had noth left __PUNCT__
whole commun had been destroi __PUNCT__
but georg bush thought peopl didn't deserv to make __NUM__ or __NUM__ buck an hour to rebuild that citi __PUNCT__
and john mccain isn't much differ __PUNCT__
he seem to think davi __PUNCT__ bacon is someth that come from a pig farm __PUNCT__
he oppos it time and time again __PUNCT__
that wrong __PUNCT__
we need to strengthen davi __PUNCT__ bacon __PUNCT__ and make sure ani new infrastructur project we propos adher to davi __PUNCT__ bacon standard __PUNCT__
and that what i do when i presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
but it not enough to make sure we pai worker fair wage and benefit __PUNCT__
we need to make sure the govern us project labor agreement to encourag complet of project on time and on budget __PUNCT__
on of the first thing georg bush did when he got into offic wa to ban pla __PUNCT__
that bad for worker and bad for america __PUNCT__ and that why on of the first thing i do as presid will be to repeal that ban and put pla back into place __PUNCT__
it time we had a presid who didn't choke sai the word __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__ it time we had a democrat nomine who didn't choke sai the word __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__ we need to strengthen our union by let them do what thei do best __PUNCT__ organ our worker __PUNCT__
if a major of worker want a union __PUNCT__ thei should get a union __PUNCT__
and that is why i fight for and why i intend to sign the employe free choic act when it land on my desk in the white hous __PUNCT__
here what els we do __PUNCT__ we put american back to work __PUNCT__
i applaud your partnership with helmet __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ hardhat __PUNCT__
i believ we have a respons to serv our soldier as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__ and by help make sure thei have the skill to work in the trade when thei come home __PUNCT__ you live up to that respons __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i support fund for thi critic program __PUNCT__
and we won't just promot job __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ we promot job __PUNCT__ creation __PUNCT__
that why we pass what i call the patriot employ act that i been work on sinc i got to the senat __PUNCT__ becaus in my administr __PUNCT__ we not go to give tax break to compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ we give them to compani that creat good job with decent wage here in america __PUNCT__
we go to invest in thi countri __PUNCT__
back in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ american were put to work build the interst highwai system and that help expand our middl class __PUNCT__
we need to show the same kind of leadership todai __PUNCT__
that why i call for a nation infrastructur reinvest bank that will invest __MONEY__ billion over ten year and gener million of new job __PUNCT__
we can't keep stand by while our road and bridg and airport crumbl and decai __PUNCT__
for our economi __PUNCT__ our safeti __PUNCT__ and our worker __PUNCT__ we have to rebuild america __PUNCT__
invest in america mean invest in the job of the futur __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be send billion of dollar to foreign nation becaus of our addict to oil __PUNCT__
we should be invest in american __PUNCT__ made solar panel __PUNCT__ windmil __PUNCT__ and clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
that why i propos invest __MONEY__ billion over the next ten year in the green energi sector __PUNCT__
thi will creat up to five million new american job __PUNCT__ and those ar job that pai well __PUNCT__ and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
that why thi will be a prioriti in my administr __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know some will sai we can't afford all thi __PUNCT__
but it seem to me __PUNCT__ if we can spend __MONEY__ billion a month rebuild iraq __PUNCT__ we can spend __MONEY__ billion a year in our own countri to creat job and strengthen the long __PUNCT__ term competit of our economi __PUNCT__
but if we seriou about fight for our worker here at home __PUNCT__ we got to fight for them around the world __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the truth is trade is here to stai __PUNCT__ and that if we have strong labor and environment protect in our agreement __PUNCT__ and if our trade partner ar plai by the rule __PUNCT__ trade can be a good thing for our worker and our economi __PUNCT__
but what we can't do is ignor violenc against union organ in colombia __PUNCT__
what we can't do is sign trade deal that put the interest of multin corpor ahead of the interest of our worker or our environ __PUNCT__
that why i oppos nafta __PUNCT__ and cafta __PUNCT__ and that why i make sure our trade agreement work for all american when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
so make no mistak __PUNCT__ the american peopl have a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can talk about our econom problem all we want __PUNCT__ but unless we chang the broken system in washington __PUNCT__ noth els is go to chang __PUNCT__
we can talk all we want about stand up for our worker __PUNCT__ but unless we have a presid you can trust to listen and put work american first __PUNCT__ noth is realli go to chang __PUNCT__
and you can trust me __PUNCT__
becaus polit didn't lead me to work folk __PUNCT__ work folk led me to polit __PUNCT__
i wa stand with american worker on the street of chicago twenti year ago __PUNCT__ and the reason i here todai is becaus i don't want to wake up on dai mani year from now and see that our worker ar still be deni the wage and benefit and right that thei deserv __PUNCT__ or that we still haven't made the invest in infrastructur and in train our worker that we desper need __PUNCT__
the reason i here todai is becaus i know what it like to go to colleg on student loan __PUNCT__ and see a mother get sick and worri that mayb she can't pai the bill __PUNCT__
i know what it like to have to scratch and work and claw to build a better life for your famili __PUNCT__
and i don't want to wake up mani year from now and find that the american dream is still out of reach for too mani american __PUNCT__
the reason i here todai is becaus i believ that if we can just put an end to the polit of divis and distract __PUNCT__ and reclaim that sens that we all have a stake in each other __PUNCT__ that we rise and fall as on nation __PUNCT__ if we can just unit thi countri around a common purpos __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ hispan __PUNCT__ asian __PUNCT__ and nativ american __PUNCT__ labor and manag __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ republican __PUNCT__ and independ __PUNCT__ there no obstacl we cannot overcom __PUNCT__ no destini we cannot fulfil __PUNCT__
that the fundament truth i learn on the street of chicago __PUNCT__
that the idea at the heart of the build and construct trade __PUNCT__
and that the opportun we have in thi elect __PUNCT__
there is a moment in the life of everi gener where that spirit of uniti and hope ha to come through if we go to make our mark on histori __PUNCT__
thi is our moment __PUNCT__
thi is our time __PUNCT__
i proud and honor that the first union endors i receiv in thi campaign wa from a build and construct trade union __PUNCT__ the plumber and pipefitt __PUNCT__
and i be proud and honor to have all of your support __PUNCT__
and if you will march with me __PUNCT__ and organ with me __PUNCT__ and if you vote for me __PUNCT__ then i promis you thi __PUNCT__ we will not just win thi democrat nomin __PUNCT__ we will win the gener elect and then togeth __PUNCT__ you and i __PUNCT__ we go to chang thi countri __PUNCT__ and we go to chang thi world __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
