thei ar some of the hardest work peopl in america and when a disast strike __PUNCT__ a katrina __PUNCT__ a shoot __PUNCT__ or a six alarm blaze __PUNCT__ it citi hall we lean on __PUNCT__
it citi hall we call first __PUNCT__
and it citi hall we depend on to get us through the tough time __PUNCT__
last weekend __PUNCT__ i attend a servic to commemor the __NUM__ anniversari of the la riot __PUNCT__
after a juri acquit __NUM__ polic offic of beat rodnei king __PUNCT__ a beat that wa film and flash around the world __PUNCT__ lo angel erupt __PUNCT__
i rememb the sens of despair and powerless in watch on of america greatest citi engulf in flame __PUNCT__
but i want to start todai with an inspir stori from that tragic event __PUNCT__ a stori about a babi who wa born into thi world with a bullet in it arm __PUNCT__
we learn about thi child from a doctor name andi moosa __PUNCT__
he wa work the afternoon shift on __DATE__ at st __PUNCT__ franci medic center in lynwood as the second dai of violenc wa explod in the street __PUNCT__
he told us about a pregnant woman who had been wear a white dress __PUNCT__
she wa in compton and on her wai to the supermarket __PUNCT__
where the bullet came from nobodi knew __PUNCT__
her sister __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law notic a red spot in the middl of her white dress and said that i think you been shot __PUNCT__
the bullet had gone in __PUNCT__ but it had not exit __PUNCT__
the doctor describ the ultrasound and how he realiz that the bullet wa in the babi __PUNCT__
the doctor said __PUNCT__ we could tell it wa lodg in on of the upper limb __PUNCT__
we need to get thi babi out so we were in the deliveri room __PUNCT__
and here the thing __PUNCT__ the babi look great __PUNCT__
except for the swell in the right elbow in the fleshi part __PUNCT__ it hadn't even fractur a bone __PUNCT__
the bullet had lodg in the soft tissu in the muscl __PUNCT__
the babi wa fine __PUNCT__
it wa breath and cry and kick __PUNCT__
thei remov the bullet __PUNCT__ stitch up the babi arm __PUNCT__ and everyth wa fine __PUNCT__
the doctor went on to sai that there alwai go to be a scar to remind that child how quickli she came into the world in veri unusu circumst __PUNCT__
let think about that stori __PUNCT__
there alwai go to be a scar there __PUNCT__ that doesn't go awai __PUNCT__
you take the bullet out __PUNCT__
you stitch up the wound and __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ there still go to be a scar __PUNCT__
mani of the student in thi room were just learn to read and write when the riot start and tragedi struck the corner of florenc and normandi __PUNCT__
most of the mayor here know that those riot didn't erupt over night __PUNCT__ there had been a __PUNCT__ quiet riot __PUNCT__ build up in lo angel and across thi countri for year __PUNCT__
if you had gone to ani street corner in chicago or baton roug or selma or trenton or arcola __PUNCT__ mississippi __PUNCT__ you would have found the same young men and women without hope __PUNCT__ without prospect __PUNCT__ and without a sens of destini other than life on the edg __PUNCT__ the edg of the law __PUNCT__ the edg of the economi __PUNCT__ the edg of famili structur and commun __PUNCT__
those __PUNCT__ quiet riot __PUNCT__ that take place everi dai ar born from the same place as the fire and the destruct and the polic deck out in riot gear and the death __PUNCT__
thei happen when a sens of disconnect settl in and hope dissip __PUNCT__
despair take hold and young peopl all across thi countri look at the wai the world is and believ that thing ar never go to get ani better __PUNCT__
you tell yourself __PUNCT__ my school will alwai crumbl __PUNCT__
there will never be a good job wait for me to excel at __PUNCT__
there will never be a place that i can be proud of and i can afford to call my home __PUNCT__
that despair quietli simmer and make it imposs to build strong commun and neighborhood __PUNCT__
and then on afternoon a juri sai __PUNCT__ not guilti __PUNCT__ or a hurrican hit __PUNCT__ and that despair is reveal for the world to see __PUNCT__
much of what we saw on our televis screen __NUM__ year ago wa lo angel express a linger __PUNCT__ ongo __PUNCT__ pervas legaci __PUNCT__ a tragic legaci out of the tragic histori thi countri ha never fulli come to term with __PUNCT__
thi is not to excus the violenc of bash in a man head or destroi someon store and their life work __PUNCT__
that kind of violenc is inexcus and self __PUNCT__ defeat __PUNCT__
it doe __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ describ the realiti of mani commun around thi countri __PUNCT__
and it made me think about our citi and commun all around thi countri __PUNCT__ how not onli do we still have scar from that riot and the __PUNCT__ quiet riot __PUNCT__ that happen everi dai __PUNCT__ but how in too mani place we haven't even taken the bullet out __PUNCT__
look at what happen in new orlean and along the gulf coast when katrina hit __PUNCT__
peopl ask me whether i thought race wa the reason the respons wa so slow __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
thi administr wa colorblind in it incompet __PUNCT__
but everyon here know the disast and the poverti happen long befor that hurrican hit __PUNCT__
all the hurrican did wa make bare what we ignor each and everi dai which is that there ar whole set of commun that ar impoverish __PUNCT__ that don't have meaning opportun __PUNCT__ that don't have hope and thei ar forgotten __PUNCT__
thi disast wa a power metaphor for what gone on for gener __PUNCT__
in new orlean __PUNCT__ the murder rate wa on of the highest in the countri __PUNCT__ ten time the nation averag __PUNCT__ well befor the hurrican hit __PUNCT__
young men di far more frequent from gunshot wound than thei did from anyth els __PUNCT__
the school were fail long befor the leve broke __PUNCT__
the citi poverti rate wa twice the nation averag __PUNCT__
there wa a reason why the evacu fail and so mani peopl were strand on their roof top __PUNCT__
the folk who were make the plan assum that peopl had car that thei could fill up with ga __PUNCT__ put some perrier in the back __PUNCT__ drive to a hotel __PUNCT__ and check in with a credit card for a week __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ the feder respons after katrina wa similar to the respons after the riot in lo angel __PUNCT__
peopl in washington wake up and ar surpris that there poverti in our midst __PUNCT__ and that other were frustrat and angri __PUNCT__
then there ar panel and there ar hear __PUNCT__
there ar commiss __PUNCT__
there ar report __PUNCT__
aid dollar ar approv but thei can't seem to get to the peopl __PUNCT__
and then noth realli chang except the new coverag quiet down __PUNCT__
thi isn't to diminish the extraordinari generos of the american peopl at the time __PUNCT__
i want to thank the faculti and student here at southern univers for turn your field hous and dorm into shelter for so mani in the aftermath of katrina __PUNCT__
that act of kind __PUNCT__ the light in that storm __PUNCT__ will never be forgotten __PUNCT__
i want to thank the nation confer of black mayor for their effort __PUNCT__ secur more __MONEY__ million in new market tax credit to assist with redevelop __PUNCT__ and creat your own disast relief fund that help __NUM__ famili in __NUM__ gulf coast commun __PUNCT__
but despit thi extraordinari generos __PUNCT__ here we ar __NUM__ month later __PUNCT__ or15 year later in the case of la __PUNCT__ and the home haven't been built __PUNCT__ the busi haven't return __PUNCT__ and those same commun ar still drown and smolder under the same hopeless as befor the tragedi hit __PUNCT__
it is time for us to come togeth and take the bullet out __PUNCT__
if we have more black men in prison than ar in our colleg and univers __PUNCT__ then it time to take the bullet out __PUNCT__
if we have almost __NUM__ million peopl go to the emerg room for treatabl ill like asthma that cost us half a billion dollar __PUNCT__ it time to take the bullet out __PUNCT__
if on out of everi nine kid doesn't have health insur __PUNCT__ it time to take the bullet out __PUNCT__
if we keep send our kid to dilapid school build __PUNCT__ if we keep fight thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ a war that never should have been author and wage __PUNCT__ a war that cost us __MONEY__ million dollar a dai and the sacrific of so mani innoc live __PUNCT__ if we have all these challeng and noth chang __PUNCT__ then everi mayor in america need to come togeth __PUNCT__ form our own surgeri team __PUNCT__ and take the bullet out __PUNCT__
let start with educ __PUNCT__
we know what work __PUNCT__
we know that if we put a dollar into earli childhood educ that we get seven dollar back in reduc drop out rate __PUNCT__ reduc delinqu __PUNCT__ reduc prison rate __PUNCT__ more young peopl can go to colleg and get good job __PUNCT__
we know thei work __PUNCT__
an import studi about an old program call abecedarian __PUNCT__ in which children from low __PUNCT__ incom famili __PUNCT__ almost all of them black __PUNCT__ receiv full __PUNCT__ time educ child care from infanc through ag __NUM__ said kid were three time more like to go to colleg __PUNCT__
thei were half as like to becom a teen parent and smoke marijuana __PUNCT__
in anoth studi about anoth effect program at the perri preschool __PUNCT__ which serv low __PUNCT__ incom black children in michigan __PUNCT__ kid need special educ less often __PUNCT__ and thei were three time as like to own their own home and half as like to go on welfar __PUNCT__
that earli childhood program even help the next gener __PUNCT__
so we know what it take to improv our school __PUNCT__
we know that if children ar learn in dilapid build with teacher that ar underpaid and textbook that ar __NUM__ year old __PUNCT__ thei will not learn __PUNCT__
to chang thi __PUNCT__ we need to fundament reform no child left behind __PUNCT__
the slogan is right __PUNCT__ but how the law ha been implement is wrong __PUNCT__
the slogan is good __PUNCT__ but how thei left the monei behind is wrong __PUNCT__
let get seriou __PUNCT__
let final make a qualiti educ access to everi american child so that everi student can graduat from high school readi for colleg and work in a knowledg __PUNCT__ base economi __PUNCT__
to begin the great transform in our school __PUNCT__ we need to invest in the most import part of a child educ __PUNCT__ the man or woman stand at the head of the classroom __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will recruit hundr of thousand of new teacher and princip __PUNCT__
for what it cost us to fund the iraq war for __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ we can recruit a new armi of teacher and princip __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will recruit a new gener of scienc and technolog leader to teach our children the skill thei will need to be competit __PUNCT__
we need to expand summer learn opportun for our children emphas math and scienc __PUNCT__
and student __PUNCT__ who live in poverti __PUNCT__ suffer from a learn disabl or who don't speak english at home __PUNCT__ should get the extra help thei need and their school need the resourc to help their student reach their full potenti __PUNCT__
i want to support teacher at all stage of their career by increas salari across the board __PUNCT__ improv incent to get the best teacher to work in our rural area and our most challeng citi __PUNCT__ provid more resourc so that teacher have more secur and control over their classroom __PUNCT__ and by provid more opportun for profession develop __PUNCT__
there ar model of excel in mani commun that show when you put a great teacher in a classroom __PUNCT__ student can learn __PUNCT__
there murphi high school in mobil alabama and rufu king in milwauke wisconsin __PUNCT__
there no shortag of great idea __PUNCT__ we just need to scale them up __PUNCT__
we need to get past the old style of polit that onli talk about educ and start actual educ our kid for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
and while we at it __PUNCT__ let do someth for the young peopl readi for colleg __PUNCT__
here at southern univers in baton roug __PUNCT__ i sure that thi won't come as a surpris when i sai that colleg tuition rate ar rise almost __NUM__ percent a year __PUNCT__
those increas have price out more than __NUM__ student in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and for what it cost to fund the iraq war for three week __PUNCT__ we could provid each student with four year at a public colleg or univers __PUNCT__
we all know how import educ is __PUNCT__
it a passport to a better life __PUNCT__
but million of children ar not given an equal chanc to realiz their own potenti __PUNCT__
and for too long __PUNCT__ our kid __PUNCT__ not __PUNCT__ those kid __PUNCT__ but our kid __PUNCT__ have been ask to settl for mediocr simpli becaus of their zip code __PUNCT__ the color of their skin __PUNCT__ and how much their parent earn __PUNCT__
thi is wrong __PUNCT__
we must chang __PUNCT__
we must take thi bullet out if america is to remain the lead forc for good and creativ and innov in thi world __PUNCT__
but we can't stop at educ if we want stronger commun __PUNCT__
we need to provid econom opportun in everi corner of our countri if we want to take the bullet out __PUNCT__
we know what it take to develop our commun econom __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ the iraq war is set to cost us __MONEY__ trillion dollar __PUNCT__ that more than enough to lai broadband line from __PUNCT__ columbia south carolina to portland oregon __PUNCT__
what good is the inform super highwai when too mani town and citi ar still ride around in dial __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
we must connect the disconnect so econom opportun is there for everyon __PUNCT__ not just everyon who can afford it __PUNCT__
it might not stop certain job from be outsourc to india __PUNCT__ but thi nation effort would creat job over __NUM__ job a year over the next two decad and improv our countri competit __PUNCT__
we know that we have to invest in transit job too __PUNCT__
when there ar peopl who ar homeless __PUNCT__ veteran struggl with post __PUNCT__ traumat stress disord from thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ and thousand of children ag out of foster care __PUNCT__ we can't expect them to have all the skill thei need for work __PUNCT__
thei mai need help with basic skill __PUNCT__ how to show up to work on time __PUNCT__ wear the right cloth __PUNCT__ and act appropri in an offic __PUNCT__
we have to help them get there __PUNCT__
that why i have call for __MONEY__ million to begin innov new job train and workforc develop program __PUNCT__
thi plan will also provid mentor opportun and let case worker help men and women make difficult transit __PUNCT__
it will coordin with local employ __PUNCT__ commun colleg __PUNCT__ and commun organ so that job train program ar actual connect to good pai job with the opportun for career growth __PUNCT__
thi would help lift more peopl out of poverti and into the middl class __PUNCT__
there ar model all across thi countri for how for how we can rebuild our citi and commun __PUNCT__
there a new idea come for the gulf coast and the new orlean area __PUNCT__
congressman benni thompson of mississippi __PUNCT__ emanuel cleaver __PUNCT__ the former mayor of kansa citi and head of the nation confer of black mayor __PUNCT__ and other member of the congression black caucu will soon introduc legisl that creat a gulf coast recoveri and empower initi __PUNCT__
it will emploi peopl who fled the region to rebuild the region __PUNCT__ the hous __PUNCT__ the busi __PUNCT__ road and bridg __PUNCT__
it will give peopl an incent to move back home and put them back to work __PUNCT__
that the kind of leadership we need to take the bullet out __PUNCT__
if we want to creat more job in our commun __PUNCT__ let stop send __MONEY__ million a dai to some of the most hostil nation on the planet and end our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__
we don't have an energi polici right now __PUNCT__
that why we fund both side of the war on terror __PUNCT__ melt the polar ic cap __PUNCT__ and let the old style of polit make sure that detroit doesn't produc more fuel effici car __PUNCT__
and if we don't do someth soon __PUNCT__ more katrina ar go to happen and we know which commun will bear the brunt of those storm __PUNCT__
when it come to global climat chang and develop the fuel for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ america must lead __PUNCT__
i want our farmer to grow the renew fuel and produc biofuel __PUNCT__
i want us to lead the wai on low carbon fuel __PUNCT__
i want our young peopl to imagin and build the next great invent __PUNCT__
if we final have a presid who deal with thi challeng __PUNCT__ we could not onli make our countri safer __PUNCT__ we could save the planet and creat job throughout all our commun __PUNCT__
we must meet thi challeng __PUNCT__
we must take the bullet out that stop our progress for all these year and bring more econom opportun to everi commun __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
but while we at it __PUNCT__ what good is an educ and a job __PUNCT__ if there ar onli million dollar mansion and quarter million dollar condo and you can't afford a place to live __PUNCT__ when our children ar be price out of the neighborhood and town thei grew up in and when famili cannot find safe place to live near their job __PUNCT__ that a bullet that got to come out too __PUNCT__
we have to invest in hous again __PUNCT__
in too mani commun low __PUNCT__ incom famili ar price out of the hous market __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ there is not a singl metropolitan area in the countri where a famili earn minimum wage can afford decent hous __PUNCT__
we need to creat an afford hous trust fund that would creat as much as __NUM__ new afford unit in mix incom neighborhood __PUNCT__
we need to fulli fund the commun develop block grant initi __PUNCT__
as a former commun organ on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ i know how critic those grant ar and we have to do more to strengthen the partnership between the feder and local govern when it relat to hous program like section __NUM__ for all those senior who lost their apart when the hurrican hit __PUNCT__
we can do thi __PUNCT__
we must also do more to protect homeown in thi countri __PUNCT__
a recent report found that the hous market experienc it worst sale __PUNCT__ month in __NUM__ year and foreclosur ar up __NUM__ __PUNCT__ compar to last year __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ too mani peopl ar caught in a nightmar caus by mortgag fraud and predatori lend __PUNCT__
that is why my __PUNCT__ stop fraud __PUNCT__ propos requir mortgag profession to report suspect fraudul activ and support state and local law enforc in their effort to fight fraud __PUNCT__
it address abus in the subprim loan market where __NUM__ million homeown mai be at risk of foreclosur __PUNCT__
and it provid __MONEY__ million for hous counsel to tenant __PUNCT__ homeown __PUNCT__ and other consum so thei get the advic and guidanc thei need befor bui a hous and support if thei get in to troubl down the road __PUNCT__
even if we succe in make hous and homeownership afford for all __PUNCT__ if we don't help strengthen the famili that live insid those home __PUNCT__ then those bullet will make the american hous crumbl from the insid out __PUNCT__
we have to do more to help famili balanc work and take care of on anoth __PUNCT__
let help __NUM__ million children by extend the child tax credit to low __PUNCT__ incom worker __PUNCT__
let stop spend __MONEY__ million a dai in iraq and pass some tax cut that peopl actual need __PUNCT__
if we want stronger famili in america __PUNCT__ then we have to confront the tough issu __PUNCT__
when too mani father think that respons end at concept __PUNCT__ when thei have not yet realiz that what make you a man is not the abil to have a child but the courag to rais on __PUNCT__ we know that our famili ar in crisi __PUNCT__
that a self __PUNCT__ inflict wound we all have to help heal __PUNCT__
now there ar wai that the govern can help __PUNCT__
that why i introduc the respons fatherhood and healthi famili act __PUNCT__
it provid father with innov job train servic and increas access to the earn incom tax credit __PUNCT__ eitc __PUNCT__
it call for an increas in child support enforc by almost __MONEY__ billion over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ result in nearli __MONEY__ billion in collect __PUNCT__
that monei will go directli to children and their mother __PUNCT__
but let be honest __PUNCT__ govern alon can't solv the breakdown of our famili __PUNCT__
thi is someth we have to look to ourselv so that father becom parent too __PUNCT__
we know what the challeng ar in small town and big citi across thi countri __PUNCT__
we know what those bullet ar __PUNCT__
we talk about them for year __PUNCT__
what stop us from meet these challeng and take these bullet out is not the absenc of sound polici and sensibl plan __PUNCT__
what stop us is the failur of leadership and absenc of urgenc and a belief that if we ignor our problem like discrimin and poverti that thei will someon how go awai __PUNCT__
for the last six year we been told that our mount debt don't matter __PUNCT__ we been told that the anxieti american feel about rise health care cost and stagnant wage ar an illus __PUNCT__ we been told that climat chang is a hoax __PUNCT__ and that tough talk and an ill __PUNCT__ conceiv war can replac diplomaci __PUNCT__ and strategi __PUNCT__ and foresight __PUNCT__
and when all els fail __PUNCT__ when katrina happen __PUNCT__ or the death toll in iraq mount __PUNCT__ we been told that our crise ar somebodi els fault __PUNCT__
we distract from our real failur __PUNCT__ and told to blame the other parti __PUNCT__ or gai peopl __PUNCT__ or immigr __PUNCT__
that kind of polit ha to stop __PUNCT__
that kind of quackeri ha to stop __PUNCT__
we don't need anymor faith healer and snake oil salesmen __PUNCT__
we need some doctor to take the bullet out __PUNCT__
befor we can start that work __PUNCT__ we need to end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ which ha cost our countri and our peopl so much __PUNCT__
i oppos it from the veri start __PUNCT__ back in __NUM__ when it wasn't popular to be against thi war __PUNCT__
i oppos it becaus i believ strongli that it could lead to the disast we find ourselv in todai __PUNCT__ with our brave young servic men and women mire in the middl of a civil war __PUNCT__
thi war never should have been author by congress and it never should have been wage __PUNCT__
and it time __PUNCT__ onc and for all __PUNCT__ to bring our troop home __PUNCT__
it time to recogn that american soldier can't solv iraq polit differ or ethnic rivalri __PUNCT__
that why i introduc a plan in __DATE__ that would have begun withdraw our combat forc on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ five dai ago __PUNCT__ and would have brought them home by __DATE__ __PUNCT__ while forc the iraqi govern to meet it oblig __PUNCT__
and thi is basic the plan the presid veto thi week __PUNCT__ defi not just a major of congress but the will of the american peopl __PUNCT__
but rest assur __PUNCT__ hi veto wa not the last word __PUNCT__
if the presid continu to stubbornli ignor the realiti of iraq __PUNCT__ we intend to forc our colleagu in the senat and hous to take vote after vote until we overcom hi veto or he final understand that we have to chang cours __PUNCT__
we need __NUM__ republican vote in the senat to overrid a veto __PUNCT__
there a republican right here in louisiana who need to vote to end the war __PUNCT__
tomorrow i be in iowa and there a senat there whose vote we need __PUNCT__
i need the mayor and the student here to call their senat and congressman too __PUNCT__
thi is the onli chanc we have to truli end the war __PUNCT__
it not symbol __PUNCT__ thi is real __PUNCT__
sixteen vote and we can turn the page on thi war __PUNCT__
sixteen vote and we can start bring our men and women home __PUNCT__
let me just close by sai thi __PUNCT__
we can onli meet these challeng togeth __PUNCT__
we can onli take these bullet out togeth __PUNCT__
we can onli strengthen our citi and town and in turn transform our nation __PUNCT__ togeth __PUNCT__
we know how the doctor do it __PUNCT__
we watch some of these tv show like er and grai anatomi __PUNCT__
the doctor ar in the oper room __PUNCT__
on got the scalpel __PUNCT__ but other ar watch the monitor and administ the iv __PUNCT__
the nurs ar on the job __PUNCT__
the orderli ar on the job __PUNCT__
there wa a team that got the bullet out of that babi girl __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
she got a scar on her arm __PUNCT__ alwai will __PUNCT__ but she surviv __PUNCT__
america is go to surviv __PUNCT__
we won't forget where we came from __PUNCT__
we won't forget what happen __NUM__ month ago __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
we go to pull out bullet after bullet __PUNCT__
we go to stitch up arm after arm __PUNCT__

we go to usher in a new america the wai that newborn child wa usher in __PUNCT__
we never go to forget there is alwai hope __PUNCT__ there is alwai light in the midst of desper dai __PUNCT__ that a babi can be born even with a bullet in her arm __PUNCT__
and we can come togeth as on peopl and transform thi nation __PUNCT__
