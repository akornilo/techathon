america is a countri that hasn't come easili __PUNCT__
in our brief histori __PUNCT__ we have been test by revolut and slaveri __PUNCT__ war and depress __PUNCT__ and great movement for social __PUNCT__ civil __PUNCT__ and equal right __PUNCT__
we have emerg from each challeng stronger __PUNCT__ more prosper __PUNCT__ and ever closer to the ideal of liberti and opportun that lai at the heart of the american experi __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ the price of our progress ha alwai been born by the struggl and sacrific of our peopl __PUNCT__ by leader who have ask ordinari american to do extraordinari thing __PUNCT__ and by gener of men and women who had the courag to answer that call __PUNCT__
it wa the greatest of all gener that took up thi charg in the dai after the attack on pearl harbor __PUNCT__
almost overnight __PUNCT__ thei were ask to transform a peacetim economi that wa still climb out from the depth of depress into an arsen of democraci that could wage war across three contin __PUNCT__
if you weren't head oversea __PUNCT__ you were head into the factori __PUNCT__ factori that had to be immedi retool and reorgan to produc the world greatest fight machin __PUNCT__
mani doubt whether thi could be achiev in time __PUNCT__ or even at all __PUNCT__
presid franklin roosevelt own advisor told him that hi goal for wartim product were unrealist and imposs to meet __PUNCT__
but the presid simpli wave them off __PUNCT__ sai __PUNCT__ believ me __PUNCT__ the product peopl can do it if thei realli try __PUNCT__
and so the nation turn here __PUNCT__ to detroit __PUNCT__ with the hope that the motor citi could lead the wai in us it assembl line to mass produc arm instead of automobil __PUNCT__
at first __PUNCT__ the industri wa skeptic about whether thi wa technolog possibl or even profit in the long run __PUNCT__
but after repeat assur from roosevelt and some help from the feder govern __PUNCT__ the arsen began to churn __PUNCT__
in an astonishingli short period of time __PUNCT__ the auto industri and it worker becam on of the nation most import contributor to the war effort __PUNCT__ manufactur more plane __PUNCT__ tank __PUNCT__ bomb and weapon than the world had ever seen __PUNCT__
the new york time declar that the automak had achiev a __PUNCT__ product miracl __PUNCT__ and it label detroit __PUNCT__ the miracul citi __PUNCT__
it wa a miracl that wa distinctli american __PUNCT__ the idea that in the face of imposs odd __PUNCT__ peopl who love their countri can rise to meet it greatest challeng __PUNCT__
it the kind of american miracl we need todai __PUNCT__
at the dawn of the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri __PUNCT__ the countri that face down the tyranni of fascism and commun is now call to challeng the tyranni of oil __PUNCT__
for the veri resourc that ha fuel our wai of life over the last hundr year now threaten to destroi it if our gener doe not act now and act boldli __PUNCT__
we know what the danger ar here __PUNCT__
we know that our oil addict is jeopard our nation secur __PUNCT__ that we fuel our energi need by send __MONEY__ million a dai to countri that includ some of the most despot __PUNCT__ volatil regim in the world __PUNCT__
we know that oil monei fund everyth from the madrassa that plant the seed of terror in young mind to the sunni insurg that attack our troop in iraq __PUNCT__
it corrupt bud democraci __PUNCT__ and give dictat from venezuela to iran the power to freeli defi and threaten the intern commun __PUNCT__
it even present a target for osama bin laden __PUNCT__ who ha told al qaeda to __PUNCT__ focu your oper on oil __PUNCT__ especi in iraq and the gulf area __PUNCT__ sinc thi will caus __PUNCT__ the american __PUNCT__ to die off on their own __PUNCT__
we know that our oil depend is jeopard our planet as well __PUNCT__ that the fossil fuel we burn ar set off a chain of danger weather pattern that could condemn futur gener to global catastroph __PUNCT__
we see the effect of global climat chang in our commun and around the world in record drought __PUNCT__ famin __PUNCT__ and forest fire __PUNCT__
hurrican and typhoon ar grow in intens __PUNCT__ and rapidli melt ic sheet in antarctica and greenland could rais global sea level high enough to swallow up larg portion of everi coastal citi and town __PUNCT__
and thi citi know better than ani what our oil addict is do to our economi __PUNCT__
we ar held hostag to the spot oil market __PUNCT__ forc to watch our fortun rise and fall with the chang price of everi barrel __PUNCT__
ga price have risen to record level __PUNCT__ and could hit __MONEY__ a gallon in some citi thi summer __PUNCT__
here in detroit __PUNCT__ three giant of american industri ar hemorrhag job and profit as foreign competitor answer the rise global demand for fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__
america simpli cannot continu on thi path __PUNCT__
the need to drastic chang our energi polici is no longer a debat proposit __PUNCT__
it is not a question of whether __PUNCT__ but how __PUNCT__ not a question of if __PUNCT__ but when __PUNCT__
for the sake of our secur __PUNCT__ our economi __PUNCT__ our job and our planet __PUNCT__ the ag of oil must end in our time __PUNCT__
thi is a challeng that ha not been solv for a lack of talk __PUNCT__
everi singl presid sinc richard nixon ha spoken in soar rhetor about the need to reduc america energi depend __PUNCT__ and mani have offer plan and polici to do so __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ everi year __PUNCT__ that depend keep on grow __PUNCT__
good idea ar crush under the weight of typic washington polit __PUNCT__
politician ar afraid to ask the oil and auto industri to do their part __PUNCT__ and those industri hire armi of lobbyist to make sure it stai that wai __PUNCT__
autowork __PUNCT__ understand fear of lose job __PUNCT__ and wise to the tendenc of have to pai the price of manag mistak __PUNCT__ join in the resist to chang __PUNCT__
the rest of us whip ourselv into a frenzi whenev ga price skyrocket or a crisi like katrina take oil off the market __PUNCT__ but onc the headlin reced __PUNCT__ so doe our motiv to act __PUNCT__
there a reason for thi __PUNCT__
a clean __PUNCT__ secur energi futur will take anoth american miracl __PUNCT__
it will requir a histor effort on the scale of what we saw in those factori dure world war ii __PUNCT__
it will requir tough choic by our govern __PUNCT__ sacrific from our busi __PUNCT__ innov from our brightest mind __PUNCT__ and the sustain commit of the american peopl __PUNCT__
it will also take leadership will to turn the page on the can't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ even try polit of the past __PUNCT__
leadership will to face down the doubter and the cynic and simpli sai __PUNCT__ believ me __PUNCT__ we can do it if we realli try __PUNCT__
i will be that kind of presid __PUNCT__ a presid who believ again in america that can __PUNCT__
a presid who believ that when it come to energi __PUNCT__ the challeng mai be great and the road mai be long __PUNCT__ but the time to act is now __PUNCT__ who know that we have the technolog __PUNCT__ we have the resourc __PUNCT__ and we ar at a rare moment of grow consensu among democrat and republican __PUNCT__ union and ceo __PUNCT__ evangel christian and militari expert who understand that thi must be our gener next great task __PUNCT__
a comprehens energi plan will requir bold action on mani front __PUNCT__
to fulli combat global climat chang __PUNCT__ we need a stringent cap on all carbon emiss and the creation of a global market that would make the develop of low __PUNCT__ carbon technolog profit and creat thousand of new job __PUNCT__
we also need to find a wai to us coal __PUNCT__ america most abund fossil fuel __PUNCT__ without ad harm greenhous gase to the environ __PUNCT__
i have alreadi endors a cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade system that would achiev real near __PUNCT__ term reduct in greenhous ga emiss and return america to a posit of leadership so that we can secur an effect and equit global solut to thi crisi __PUNCT__
it would invest substanti revenu gener by auction off emiss credit into the develop of carbon sequestr __PUNCT__ advanc biofuel __PUNCT__ and energi effici __PUNCT__
we also need new idea on energi effici and the abil to har renew sourc of energi __PUNCT__ becaus there is absolut no reason we shouldn't be abl to get at least __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our energi from clean and renew sourc by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i will be lai out more detail propos on each of these area in the month to come __PUNCT__
but here in detroit __PUNCT__ i want to focu on a few propos that would drastic reduc our oil depend and our carbon emiss by focus on two of their major caus __PUNCT__ the car we drive and the fuel we us __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ these propos would save us __NUM__ million barrel of oil per dai __PUNCT__ the equival of end all oil import from the middl east and remov __NUM__ million car __PUNCT__ worth of pollut off the road __PUNCT__
it start with our car __PUNCT__ becaus if we truli hope to end the tyranni of oil __PUNCT__ the nation must onc again turn to detroit for anoth great transform __PUNCT__
i know these ar difficult time for automak __PUNCT__ and i know that not all of the industri problem ar of it own make __PUNCT__
but we have to be honest about how we arriv at thi point __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ while foreign competitor were invest in more fuel __PUNCT__ effici technolog for their vehicl __PUNCT__ american automak were spend their time invest in bigger __PUNCT__ faster car __PUNCT__
and whenev an attempt wa made to rais our fuel effici standard __PUNCT__ the auto compani would lobbi furious against it __PUNCT__ spend million to prevent the veri reform that could save their industri __PUNCT__
even as thei shed thousand of job and billion in profit over the last few year __PUNCT__ thei continu to reward failur with lucr bonus for ceo __PUNCT__
the consequ of these choic ar now clear __PUNCT__
while our fuel standard haven't move from __NUM__ mile per gallon in two decad __PUNCT__ both china and japan have surpass us __PUNCT__ with japanes car now get an averag of __NUM__ mile to the gallon __PUNCT__
and as the global demand for fuel __PUNCT__ effici and hybrid car have skyrocket __PUNCT__ it foreign competitor who ar fill the order __PUNCT__
just the other week __PUNCT__ we learn that for the first time sinc __NUM__ toyota ha surpass gener motor as the world best __PUNCT__ sell automak __PUNCT__
at the dawn of the internet ag __PUNCT__ it wa famous said that there ar two kind of busi __PUNCT__ those that us email and those that will __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar two kind of car compani __PUNCT__ those that mass produc fuel __PUNCT__ effici car and those that will __PUNCT__
the american auto industri can no longer afford to be on of those that will __PUNCT__
what more __PUNCT__ america can't afford it __PUNCT__
when the auto industri account for on in ten american job __PUNCT__ we all have a stake in save those job __PUNCT__
when our economi __PUNCT__ our secur __PUNCT__ and the safeti of our planet depend on our abil to make cleaner __PUNCT__ more fuel __PUNCT__ effici car __PUNCT__ everi american ha a respons to make sure that happen __PUNCT__
automak still refus to make the transit to fuel __PUNCT__ effici product becaus thei sai it too expens at a time when thei lose profit and struggl under the weight of massiv health care cost __PUNCT__
thi time __PUNCT__ thei actual right __PUNCT__
the auto industri refus to act for so long ha left it mire in a predica for which there is no easi wai out __PUNCT__
but expens is no longer an excus for inact __PUNCT__
the auto industri is on a path that is unaccept and unsustain __PUNCT__ for their busi __PUNCT__ for their worker __PUNCT__ and for america __PUNCT__
and america must take action to make it right __PUNCT__
that why my first propos will requir automak to meet higher fuel standard and produc more fuel __PUNCT__ effici car while provid them the flexibl and assist to do it __PUNCT__
thi is a propos that alreadi brought togeth republican and democrat __PUNCT__ those who long __PUNCT__ advoc increas in our fuel standard __PUNCT__ and those who have oppos those increas for year __PUNCT__
it enjoi the support of corpor leader like fred smith of feder express who understand that our economi is at risk if we fail to act and militari leader like gener p.x __PUNCT__ kellei who know all to well the human cost of our nation addict to oil __PUNCT__
it a propos that answer the concern that mani have previous had with rais fuel standard __PUNCT__ that it too expens __PUNCT__ or unsaf __PUNCT__ or not achiev __PUNCT__
and it an approach that ask our govern __PUNCT__ our busi __PUNCT__ and our peopl to invest in a secur energi futur __PUNCT__ that recogn we can make great car and protect american job if we transform the auto industri so that our autowork can compet with world onc more __PUNCT__
it begin by gradual rais our fuel economi standard by four percent __PUNCT__ approxim on mile per gallon __PUNCT__ each year __PUNCT__
the nation academi of scienc ha alreadi determin that we can begin to achiev thi rate of improv todai __PUNCT__ us exist technolog and without chang a vehicl weight or perform __PUNCT__
and so the onli wai that automak can avoid meet thi goal is if the nation highwai traffic and safeti administr can prove that the increas is not safe __PUNCT__ not cost __PUNCT__ effect __PUNCT__ or not technolog possibl __PUNCT__
thi propos provid addit flexibl to manufactur as well __PUNCT__
current __PUNCT__ domest automak ar disadvantag by the requir that their fleet have to meet the same overal fuel standard as foreign manufactur even though u. __PUNCT__ compani sell a much broader arrai of vehicl __PUNCT__
my approach would establish differ fuel standard for differ type of car __PUNCT__
thi reform will level the plai field by requir all car maker to achiev a similar rate of progress regardless of their vehicl mix __PUNCT__
it will also allow manufactur to get credit if thei increas the fuel __PUNCT__ effici in on particular car beyond what the fuel economi standard requir __PUNCT__
we also know that __PUNCT__ absent some assist __PUNCT__ the signific cost associ with retool part and assembl plant could be prohibit for compani that ar alreadi struggl and shed worker __PUNCT__
our goal is not to destroi the industri __PUNCT__ but to help bring it into the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
so if the auto industri is prepar to step up to it respons __PUNCT__ we should be prepar to help __PUNCT__
that why my propos would provid gener tax incent to help automak upgrad their exist plant in order to accommod the demand of produc more fuel __PUNCT__ effici vehicl __PUNCT__
thi approach would also strike a bargain with the auto industri on on of the biggest cost thei face __PUNCT__
we heard for year that the spiral cost of health care for retir autowork constrain manufactur from invest in more fuel __PUNCT__ effici technolog __PUNCT__
we all know the statist __PUNCT__ health care cost current account for __MONEY__ of everi gm car __PUNCT__
so here the deal __PUNCT__
we help to partial defrai those health care cost __PUNCT__ but onli if the manufactur ar will to invest the save right back into the product of more fuel __PUNCT__ effici car and truck __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we should make it easier for the american peopl to bui more fuel __PUNCT__ effici car by provid more tax credit to more consum for the purchas of hybrid and ultra __PUNCT__ effici vehicl __PUNCT__
but we should also realiz that the more choic we have as consum __PUNCT__ the more respons we have to bui these car __PUNCT__ to realiz that a few hundr extra dollar for a hybrid is the price we pai as citizen commit to a caus bigger than ourselv __PUNCT__
for too long __PUNCT__ we been either too afraid to ask our automak to meet higher fuel standard or unwil to help them do it __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ if we hope for anoth miracl out of detroit __PUNCT__ we have to do both __PUNCT__
we must demand that thei revamp their product __PUNCT__ we must assist that transit __PUNCT__ and we must make the choic to bui these car when we have the option __PUNCT__
all of us have a respons here __PUNCT__ and all of us ar requir to act __PUNCT__
now it not enough to onli build car that us less oil __PUNCT__ we also have to start move awai from that dirti __PUNCT__ dwindl fossil fuel altogeth __PUNCT__
that why my second propos will creat a market for clean __PUNCT__ burn __PUNCT__ home __PUNCT__ grown biofuel like ethanol that can replac the oil we us and begin to slow the damag caus by global climat chang __PUNCT__
the potenti for biofuel in thi countri is vast __PUNCT__
farmer who grow them know that __PUNCT__
entrepreneur and fuel station owner who want to sell them know that __PUNCT__
scientist and environmentalist who studi the atmospher know it too __PUNCT__
it time we produc __PUNCT__ sold __PUNCT__ and us biofuel all across america __PUNCT__ it time we made them as commonli avail as gasolin is now __PUNCT__
i alreadi done some of thi work in the u. __PUNCT__ senat by help to provid tax credit to those who want to sell a mix of ethanol and gasolin known as e85 at their fuel station __PUNCT__
and sinc it onli cost __MONEY__ per vehicl to instal a flexibl __PUNCT__ fuel tank that can run on biofuel __PUNCT__ i also propos that we help pai for thi transit __PUNCT__
govern should lead the wai here __PUNCT__
i show up at thi event in a govern vehicl that doe not have a flexibl __PUNCT__ fuel tank __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ i will make sure that everi vehicl purchas by the feder govern doe __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ to truli overcom the lack of a biofuel infrastructur in thi countri __PUNCT__ we need to creat a market for the product of more biofuel __PUNCT__
like the auto industri __PUNCT__ the oil industri ha gener been resist to make the transit from petroleum to biofuel __PUNCT__ with some even try to block the instal of e85 pump at fuel station __PUNCT__
to overcom thi resist and creat thi infrastructur __PUNCT__ i introduc a propos known as a nation low __PUNCT__ carbon fuel standard __PUNCT__ base on the on introduc by governor arnold schwarzenegg in california just a few month ago __PUNCT__
like rais our fuel __PUNCT__ effici standard __PUNCT__ thi approach simultan reduc our depend on oil and reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__
the idea behind the standard is simpl __PUNCT__
begin in __NUM__ we will requir petroleum maker to reduc the carbon content of their fuel mix on percent per year by sell more clean __PUNCT__ altern fuel in it place __PUNCT__
thi propos will spur greater product and avail of renew fuel like cellulos ethanol and biodiesel __PUNCT__ and it will even creat an incent for the product of more flexibl __PUNCT__ fuel and plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid vehicl that can us these clean fuel or charg up with renew electr __PUNCT__
thi approach will also allow the market __PUNCT__ not the govern __PUNCT__ to determin which fuel ar us by fuel distributor to meet the standard __PUNCT__
it gradual __PUNCT__ so it give these compani time to meet the requir __PUNCT__
and if you a fuel produc that have troubl meet the standard __PUNCT__ it allow you to pai for a credit from a compani that is __PUNCT__
the low __PUNCT__ carbon fuel standard also provid a greater incent for privat sector invest in the cleanest biofuel possibl __PUNCT__
corn __PUNCT__ base ethanol ha led the wai here __PUNCT__ and now we need to expand the univers of biofuel to includ cellulos ethanol made from switchgrass or forest wast that can reduc our carbon footprint even further __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ the two major propos i outlin todai __PUNCT__ higher fuel __PUNCT__ effici standard and a nation low __PUNCT__ carbon fuel standard __PUNCT__ will not end our oil depend entir __PUNCT__
but the transform of the car we drive and the fuel we us would be the most ambiti energi project in decad __PUNCT__ with result that would last for gener to come __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million fewer barrel of oil per dai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million car __PUNCT__ worth of pollut off the road by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the direct consum save at the pump in that year would be over __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ not to mention the great econom benefit of a rejuven and fierc competit domest auto industri __PUNCT__
some will sai that the goal ar too larg __PUNCT__ that the ask is too great __PUNCT__ and that the polit realiti is too difficult for thi to work __PUNCT__
to that i sai that we heard it all befor __PUNCT__ and we still believ we can do it if we realli try __PUNCT__
becaus that who we ar as american __PUNCT__
becaus that who we alwai been __PUNCT__
in the dai and month after __DATE__ __PUNCT__ american were wait to be call to someth larger than themselv __PUNCT__
just like their parent and grandpar of the greatest gener __PUNCT__ so mani of us were will to serv and defend our countri __PUNCT__ not onli on the field of war __PUNCT__ but on the homefront too __PUNCT__
thi is our gener chanc to answer that call __PUNCT__
meet the challeng pose by our oil depend won't requir us to build the massiv war machin that franklin roosevelt call for so mani year ago __PUNCT__ but it will requir the same sens of share sacrific and respons from all of us __PUNCT__ not just the auto industri and it worker here in detroit __PUNCT__ but oil compani in texa __PUNCT__ power plant from new jersei to california __PUNCT__ legisl in washington __PUNCT__ and consum in everi american citi and town __PUNCT__
it time for all of us to head back into the factori and univers __PUNCT__ to the boardroom and the hall of congress so we can roll up our sleev and find a wai to get thi done __PUNCT__
i am readi and will to lead us there as your next presid __PUNCT__ and i hope you ar will to join me in the journei toward that next great american miracl __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
