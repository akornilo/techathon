i wa born the year that hi brother john call a gener of american to ask their countri what thei could do __PUNCT__
and i came of ag at a time when thei did it __PUNCT__
thei were the peac corp volunt who won a gener of goodwil toward america at a time when america ideal were challeng __PUNCT__
thei were the teenag and colleg student __PUNCT__ not much older than you __PUNCT__ who watch the civil right movement unfold on their televis set __PUNCT__ who saw the dog and the fire hose and the footag of marcher beaten within an inch or their live __PUNCT__ who knew it wa probabl smarter and safer to stai at home __PUNCT__ but still decid to take those freedom ride down south __PUNCT__ who still decid to march __PUNCT__

and the second is the stori of what happen in the life of our countri __PUNCT__ of what happen in the wider world __PUNCT__
it the stori you see when you catch a glimps of the dai headlin or turn on the new at night __PUNCT__ a stori of big challeng like war and recess __PUNCT__ hunger and climat chang __PUNCT__ injustic and inequ __PUNCT__
it a stori that can sometim seem distant and separ from our own __PUNCT__ a destini to be shape by forc beyond our control __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ the histori of thi nation tell us thi isn't so __PUNCT__
it tell us that we ar a peopl whose destini ha never been written for us __PUNCT__ but by us __PUNCT__ by gener of men and women __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ who have alwai believ that their stori and the american stori ar not separ __PUNCT__ but share __PUNCT__
and for more than two centuri __PUNCT__ thei have serv thi countri in wai that have forev enrich both __PUNCT__
i sai thi to you as someon who couldn't be stand here todai if not for the servic of other __PUNCT__ and wouldn't be stand here todai if not for the purpos that servic gave my own life __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ i spent much of my childhood adrift __PUNCT__

but dure my first two year of colleg __PUNCT__ perhap becaus the valu my mother had taught me __PUNCT__ hard work __PUNCT__ honesti __PUNCT__ empathi __PUNCT__ had resurfac after a long hibern __PUNCT__ or perhap becaus of the exampl of wonder teacher and last friend __PUNCT__ i began to notic a world beyond myself __PUNCT__

i had alwai been inspir by stori of the civil right movement and jfk call to servic __PUNCT__ but when i got to the south side __PUNCT__ there were no march __PUNCT__ and no soar speech __PUNCT__
in the shadow of an empti steel plant __PUNCT__ there were just a lot of folk who were struggl __PUNCT__

i guarante you __PUNCT__ there will certainli be time when friend or famili urg you to pursu more sensibl endeavor with more tangibl reward __PUNCT__
and there will be time when you ar tempt to take their advic __PUNCT__
but i hope you rememb __PUNCT__ dure those time of doubt and frustrat __PUNCT__ that there is noth naïv about your impuls to chang thi world __PUNCT__
becaus all it take is on act of servic __PUNCT__ on blow against injustic __PUNCT__ to send forth that tini rippl of hope that robert kennedi spoke of __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ ted kennedi often tell a stori about the fifth anniversari celebr of the peac corp __PUNCT__
he wa there __PUNCT__ and he ask on of the young american why he had chosen to volunt __PUNCT__
and the man repli __PUNCT__ becaus it wa the first time someon ask me to do someth for my countri __PUNCT__
i don't know how mani of you have been ask that question __PUNCT__ but after todai __PUNCT__ you have no excus __PUNCT__
i am ask you __PUNCT__ and if i should have the honor of serv thi nation as presid __PUNCT__ i will be ask again in the come year __PUNCT__

i intend to make it a caus of my presid __PUNCT__ and i believ with all my heart that thi gener is readi __PUNCT__ and eager __PUNCT__ and up to the challeng __PUNCT__
we will face our share of cynic and doubter __PUNCT__
but we alwai have __PUNCT__
i can still rememb a convers i had with an older man all those year ago just befor i left for chicago __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ barack __PUNCT__ i give you a bit of advic __PUNCT__
forget thi commun organ busi and do someth that gonna make you some monei __PUNCT__
you can't chang the world __PUNCT__ and peopl won't appreci you try __PUNCT__
but you got a nice voic __PUNCT__ so you should think about go into televis broadcast __PUNCT__
i tell you __PUNCT__ you got a futur __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ he mai have been right about the tv thing __PUNCT__ but he wa wrong about everyth els __PUNCT__
for that old man ha not seen what i have seen __PUNCT__
he ha not seen the face of ordinari peopl the first time thei clear a vacant lot or build a new playground or forc an unrespons leader to provid servic to their commun __PUNCT__
he ha not seen the face of a child brighten becaus of an inspir teacher or mentor __PUNCT__
he ha not seen score of young peopl educ their parent on issu like darfur __PUNCT__ or mobil the conscienc of a nation around the challeng of climat chang __PUNCT__
he ha not seen line of men and women that wrap around school and church __PUNCT__ that stretch block after block just so thei could make their voic heard __PUNCT__ mani for the veri first time __PUNCT__
and that old man who didn't believ the world could chang __PUNCT__ who didn't think on person could make a differ __PUNCT__ well he certainli didn't know much about the life of joseph kennedi youngest son __PUNCT__
it is rare in thi countri of our that a person exist who ha touch the live of nearli everi singl american without mani of us even realiz it __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ becaus of ted kennedi __PUNCT__ million of children can see a doctor when thei get sick __PUNCT__
mother and father can leav work to spend time with their newborn __PUNCT__
work american ar paid higher wage __PUNCT__ and compens for overtim __PUNCT__ and can keep their health insur when thei chang job __PUNCT__
thei ar protect from discrimin in the workplac __PUNCT__ and those who ar born with disabl can still get an educ __PUNCT__ and health care __PUNCT__ and fair treatment on the job __PUNCT__
our school ar stronger and our colleg ar fill with more american who can afford it __PUNCT__
and i have a feel that ted kennedi is not done just yet __PUNCT__
but sure __PUNCT__ if on man can achiev so much and make such a differ in the live of so mani __PUNCT__ then each of us can do our part __PUNCT__
sure __PUNCT__ if hi servic and hi stori can forev shape america stori __PUNCT__ then our collect servic can shape the destini of thi gener __PUNCT__
at the veri least __PUNCT__ hi live exampl call each of us to try __PUNCT__
that is all i ask of you on thi joyou dai of new begin __PUNCT__ that is what senat kennedi ask of you as well __PUNCT__ and that is how we will keep so much need work go __PUNCT__ and the caus of justic everlast __PUNCT__ and the dream aliv for gener to come __PUNCT__
