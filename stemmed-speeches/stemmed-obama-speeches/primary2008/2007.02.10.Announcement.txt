that the journei we on todai __PUNCT__
but let me tell you how i came to be here __PUNCT__
as most of you know __PUNCT__ i am not a nativ of thi great state __PUNCT__
i move to illinoi over two decad ago __PUNCT__
i wa a young man then __PUNCT__ just a year out of colleg __PUNCT__ i knew no on in chicago __PUNCT__ wa without monei or famili connect __PUNCT__
but a group of church had offer me a job as a commun organ for __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and i accept the job __PUNCT__ sight unseen __PUNCT__ motiv then by a singl __PUNCT__ simpl __PUNCT__ power idea __PUNCT__ that i might plai a small part in build a better america __PUNCT__
my work took me to some of chicago poorest neighborhood __PUNCT__
i join with pastor and lai __PUNCT__ peopl to deal with commun that had been ravag by plant close __PUNCT__
i saw that the problem peopl face weren't simpli local in natur __PUNCT__ that the decis to close a steel mill wa made by distant execut __PUNCT__ that the lack of textbook and comput in school could be trace to the skew prioriti of politician a thousand mile awai __PUNCT__ and that when a child turn to violenc __PUNCT__ there a hole in hi heart no govern alon can fill __PUNCT__
it wa in these neighborhood that i receiv the best educ i ever had __PUNCT__ and where i learn the true mean of my christian faith __PUNCT__
after three year of thi work __PUNCT__ i went to law school __PUNCT__ becaus i want to understand how the law should work for those in need __PUNCT__
i becam a civil right lawyer __PUNCT__ and taught constitut law __PUNCT__ and after a time __PUNCT__ i came to understand that our cherish right of liberti and equal depend on the activ particip of an awaken elector __PUNCT__
it wa with these idea in mind that i arriv in thi capit citi as a state senat __PUNCT__
it wa here __PUNCT__ in springfield __PUNCT__ where i saw all that is america converg __PUNCT__ farmer and teacher __PUNCT__ businessmen and labor __PUNCT__ all of them with a stori to tell __PUNCT__ all of them seek a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__ all of them clamor to be heard __PUNCT__
i made last friendship here __PUNCT__ friend that i see in the audienc todai __PUNCT__
it wa here we learn to disagre without be disagre __PUNCT__ that it possibl to compromis so long as you know those principl that can never be compromis __PUNCT__ and that so long as we will to listen to each other __PUNCT__ we can assum the best in peopl instead of the worst __PUNCT__
that why we were abl to reform a death penalti system that wa broken __PUNCT__
that why we were abl to give health insur to children in need __PUNCT__
that why we made the tax system more fair and just for work famili __PUNCT__ and that why we pass ethic reform that the cynic said could never __PUNCT__ ever be pass __PUNCT__
it wa here __PUNCT__ in springfield __PUNCT__ where north __PUNCT__ south __PUNCT__ east and west come togeth that i wa remind of the essenti decenc of the american peopl __PUNCT__ where i came to believ that through thi decenc __PUNCT__ we can build a more hope america __PUNCT__
and that is why __PUNCT__ in the shadow of the old state capitol __PUNCT__ where lincoln onc call on a divid hous to stand togeth __PUNCT__ where common hope and common dream still __PUNCT__ i stand befor you todai to announc my candidaci for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
i recogn there is a certain presumptu __PUNCT__ a certain audac __PUNCT__ to thi announc __PUNCT__
i know i haven't spent a lot of time learn the wai of washington __PUNCT__
but i been there long enough to know that the wai of washington must chang __PUNCT__
the geniu of our founder is that thei design a system of govern that can be chang __PUNCT__
and we should take heart __PUNCT__ becaus we chang thi countri befor __PUNCT__
in the face of tyranni __PUNCT__ a band of patriot brought an empir to it knee __PUNCT__
in the face of secess __PUNCT__ we unifi a nation and set the captiv free __PUNCT__
in the face of depress __PUNCT__ we put peopl back to work and lift million out of poverti __PUNCT__
we welcom immigr to our shore __PUNCT__ we open railroad to the west __PUNCT__ we land a man on the moon __PUNCT__ and we heard a king call to let justic roll down like water __PUNCT__ and righteous like a mighti stream __PUNCT__
each and everi time __PUNCT__ a new gener ha risen up and done what need to be done __PUNCT__
todai we ar call onc more __PUNCT__ and it is time for our gener to answer that call __PUNCT__
for that is our unyield faith __PUNCT__ that in the face of imposs odd __PUNCT__ peopl who love their countri can chang it __PUNCT__
that what abraham lincoln understood __PUNCT__
he had hi doubt __PUNCT__
he had hi defeat __PUNCT__
he had hi setback __PUNCT__
but through hi will and hi word __PUNCT__ he move a nation and help free a peopl __PUNCT__
it is becaus of the million who ralli to hi caus that we ar no longer divid __PUNCT__ north and south __PUNCT__ slave and free __PUNCT__
it is becaus men and women of everi race __PUNCT__ from everi walk of life __PUNCT__ continu to march for freedom long after lincoln wa laid to rest __PUNCT__ that todai we have the chanc to face the challeng of thi millennium togeth __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__ as american __PUNCT__
all of us know what those challeng ar todai __PUNCT__ a war with no end __PUNCT__ a depend on oil that threaten our futur __PUNCT__ school where too mani children aren't learn __PUNCT__ and famili struggl paycheck to paycheck despit work as hard as thei can __PUNCT__
we know the challeng __PUNCT__
we heard them __PUNCT__
we talk about them for year __PUNCT__
what stop us from meet these challeng is not the absenc of sound polici and sensibl plan __PUNCT__
what stop us is the failur of leadership __PUNCT__ the small of our polit __PUNCT__ the eas with which we distract by the petti and trivial __PUNCT__ our chronic avoid of tough decis __PUNCT__ our prefer for score cheap polit point instead of roll up our sleev and build a work consensu to tackl big problem __PUNCT__
for the last six year we been told that our mount debt don't matter __PUNCT__ we been told that the anxieti american feel about rise health care cost and stagnant wage ar an illus __PUNCT__ we been told that climat chang is a hoax __PUNCT__ and that tough talk and an ill __PUNCT__ conceiv war can replac diplomaci __PUNCT__ and strategi __PUNCT__ and foresight __PUNCT__
and when all els fail __PUNCT__ when katrina happen __PUNCT__ or the death toll in iraq mount __PUNCT__ we been told that our crise ar somebodi els fault __PUNCT__
we distract from our real failur __PUNCT__ and told to blame the other parti __PUNCT__ or gai peopl __PUNCT__ or immigr __PUNCT__
and as peopl have look awai in disillusion and frustrat __PUNCT__ we know what fill the void __PUNCT__
the cynic __PUNCT__ and the lobbyist __PUNCT__ and the special interest who turn our govern into a game onli thei can afford to plai __PUNCT__
thei write the check and you get stuck with the bill __PUNCT__ thei get the access while you get to write a letter __PUNCT__ thei think thei own thi govern __PUNCT__ but we here todai to take it back __PUNCT__
the time for that polit is over __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
we made some progress alreadi __PUNCT__
i wa proud to help lead the fight in congress that led to the most sweep ethic reform sinc waterg __PUNCT__
but washington ha a long wai to go __PUNCT__
and it won't be easi __PUNCT__
that why we have to set prioriti __PUNCT__
we have to make hard choic __PUNCT__
and although govern will plai a crucial role in bring about the chang we need __PUNCT__ more monei and program alon will not get us where we need to go __PUNCT__
each of us __PUNCT__ in our own live __PUNCT__ will have to accept respons __PUNCT__ for instil an ethic of achiev in our children __PUNCT__ for adapt to a more competit economi __PUNCT__ for strengthen our commun __PUNCT__ and share some measur of sacrific __PUNCT__

i thought it wa a tragic mistak __PUNCT__
todai we griev for the famili who have lost love on __PUNCT__ the heart that have been broken __PUNCT__ and the young live that could have been __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ it time to start bring our troop home __PUNCT__

let the iraqi know that we will not be there forev is our last __PUNCT__ best hope to pressur the sunni and shia to come to the tabl and find peac __PUNCT__
