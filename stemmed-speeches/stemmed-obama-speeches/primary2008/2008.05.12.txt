there is an elect here tomorrow __PUNCT__
i honor that some of you will support me __PUNCT__ and i understand that mani more here in west virginia will probabl support senat clinton __PUNCT__
but when it over __PUNCT__ what will unifi as democrat __PUNCT__ what must unifi us as american __PUNCT__ is an unyield commit to the men and women who serv thi nation and an unshak fidel to the ideal for which thei risk their live __PUNCT__
without that commit __PUNCT__ mani of us wouldn't be here todai __PUNCT__
i am on of those peopl __PUNCT__
my grandfath __PUNCT__ stanlei dunham __PUNCT__ enlist after pearl harbor and went on to march in patton armi __PUNCT__
my grandmoth work on a bomber assembl line while he wa gone __PUNCT__ and my mother wa born at fort leavenworth __PUNCT__
when he return __PUNCT__ it wa to a countri that gave him the chanc to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ to bui hi first home with a loan from the fha __PUNCT__ to move hi famili west __PUNCT__ all the wai to hawaii __PUNCT__ where he and my grandmoth help rais me __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ my grandfath is buri in the punchbowl __PUNCT__ the nation memori cemeteri of the pacif __PUNCT__ where __NUM__ victim of pearl harbor ar laid to rest __PUNCT__
i knew him when he wa older __PUNCT__
but whenev i meet young men and women along the campaign trail who ar serv in the militari todai __PUNCT__ i think about what my grandfath wa like when he enlist __PUNCT__ a fresh __PUNCT__ face man of twenti __PUNCT__ three __PUNCT__ with a heart laugh and an easi smile __PUNCT__
these son and daughter of america ar the best and the bravest among us __PUNCT__
thei ar a part of an unbroken line of hero who overthrew a king for the sake of an ideal __PUNCT__ who freed the slave and face down fascism __PUNCT__ who fought for freedom in korea and vietnam __PUNCT__ from kuwait to the balkan __PUNCT__ who still wake up everi dai to face down the gravest danger in iraq __PUNCT__ afghanistan __PUNCT__ and all over the world __PUNCT__
when our troop go into battl __PUNCT__ thei serv no faction or parti __PUNCT__ thei repres no race or region __PUNCT__
thei ar simpli american __PUNCT__
thei serv and fight and bleed togeth out of loyalti not just to a place on a map or a certain kind of peopl __PUNCT__ but to a set of ideal that we have been strive for sinc the first shot rang out at lexington and concord __PUNCT__ the idea that america could be govern not by men __PUNCT__ but by law __PUNCT__ that we could be equal in the ey of those law __PUNCT__ that we could be free to sai what we want and write what want and worship as we pleas __PUNCT__ that we could have the right to pursu our individu dream but the oblig to help our fellow citizen pursu their __PUNCT__
allegi to these ideal ha alwai been at the core of american patriot __PUNCT__ it what unit a countri of so mani differ opinion and belief __PUNCT__
it why some of us mai disagre on our decis to start thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ but all of us stand unit in our support for the brave men and women who wage it __PUNCT__
that how it should be __PUNCT__
but it not how it alwai been __PUNCT__
on of the saddest episod in our histori wa the degre to which return vet from vietnam were shun __PUNCT__ demon and neglect by some becaus thei serv in an unpopular war __PUNCT__
too mani of those who oppos the war in vietnam chose to blame not onli the leader who order the mission __PUNCT__ but the young men who simpli answer their countri call __PUNCT__
four decad later __PUNCT__ the sting of that injustic is a wound that ha never fulli heal __PUNCT__ and on that should never be repeat __PUNCT__
the young men and women who choos to serv ar defend the veri right and freedom that allow american to speak out against govern action we oppos __PUNCT__
thei deserv our admir __PUNCT__ respect and endur gratitud __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we must never forget that honor thi servic and uphold these ideal requir more than salut our veteran as thei march by on veteran dai or memori dai __PUNCT__
it requir march with them for the care and benefit thei have earn it requir stand shoulder __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ shoulder with our veteran and their famili after the gun fall silent and the camera ar turn off __PUNCT__
at a time when we face the largest homecom sinc the second world war __PUNCT__ the true test of our patriot is whether we will serv our return hero as well as thei serv us __PUNCT__
we know that over the last eight year __PUNCT__ we alreadi fallen short of meet thi test __PUNCT__
we all learn about the deplor condit that were discov at place like fort bragg and walter reed __PUNCT__
we all walk by a veteran whose home is now a cardboard box on a street corner in the richest nation on earth __PUNCT__
we all heard about what it like to navig the broken bureaucraci of the va __PUNCT__ the imposs long line __PUNCT__ or the repeat call for help that get you noth more than an answer machin __PUNCT__
just a few week ago __PUNCT__ an __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old world war ii veteran from south carolina told hi famili __PUNCT__ no matter what i appli for at the va __PUNCT__ thei turn me down __PUNCT__
the next dai __PUNCT__ he walk outsid of an outpati clinic in greenvil and took hi own life __PUNCT__
how can we let thi happen __PUNCT__ how is that accept in the unit state of america __PUNCT__ the answer is __PUNCT__ it not __PUNCT__
it an outrag __PUNCT__
and it a betray __PUNCT__ a betray __PUNCT__ of the ideal that we ask our troop to risk their live for __PUNCT__
but it doesn't have to be thi wai __PUNCT__
not in thi countri __PUNCT__
not if we decid that thi time will be differ __PUNCT__
there ar mani aspect of thi war that have gone inalter wrong __PUNCT__ but care for our veteran is on thing we can still get right __PUNCT__
when i arriv in the senat __PUNCT__ i sought out a seat on the veteran affair committe so i could fight to give our veteran the care thei need and the benefit thei deserv __PUNCT__
we fought to make sure that the claim of disabl veteran in illinoi and other state were be heard fairli __PUNCT__ and we forc the va to conduct an unpreced outreach campaign to disabl veteran who receiv lower __PUNCT__ than __PUNCT__ averag benefit __PUNCT__
i pass law to get homeless veteran off the street and prevent at __PUNCT__ risk veteran from get there in the first place __PUNCT__
i led a bipartisan effort to improv outpati facil at place like walter reed __PUNCT__ and slash red tape __PUNCT__ and reform the disabl process __PUNCT__ becaus recov troop should go to the front of the line __PUNCT__ and thei shouldn't have to fight to get there __PUNCT__
i pass law to give famili member health care while thei care for injur troop __PUNCT__ and to provid famili member with a year of job protect __PUNCT__ so thei never have to face a choic between care for a love on and keep a job __PUNCT__
but there is so much more work that we need to do in thi countri __PUNCT__
it start with be honest about the sacrific that our brave men and women ar make __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha refus to count all of our casualti in uniform __PUNCT__
in iraq alon __PUNCT__ ten of thousand of troop who were injur or fell ill have not been count in our casualti number __PUNCT__ go against the militari own standard from past war __PUNCT__
it time to stop hide the full cost of thi war __PUNCT__
it time to honor the full measur of sacrific of our troop __PUNCT__ and to prepar for the cost of their care __PUNCT__
that why i pledg to build a __NUM__ centuri va as presid __PUNCT__
it mean no more red tape __PUNCT__ it time to give everi servic __PUNCT__ member electron copi of medic and servic record upon discharg __PUNCT__
it mean no more shortfal __PUNCT__ we fulli fund va health care __PUNCT__ and add more vet center __PUNCT__ particularli in rural area __PUNCT__
it mean no more delai __PUNCT__ we pass on __PUNCT__ time budget __PUNCT__
it mean no more mean __PUNCT__ test __PUNCT__ it time to allow everi veteran into the va system __PUNCT__
and it mean we have a simpl principl for veteran sleep on our street __PUNCT__ zero toler __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i build on the work i start in the senat and expand hous voucher __PUNCT__ and launch a new support servic hous program to prevent at __PUNCT__ risk veteran and their famili from slide into homeless __PUNCT__
i also build on the work i did in the senat to confront on of the signatur injuri of the war in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__ ptsd __PUNCT__
we have to understand that for far too mani troop and their famili __PUNCT__ the war doesn't end when thei come home __PUNCT__
just the other dai our own govern top psychiatr research said that becaus of inadequ mental health care __PUNCT__ the number of suicid among veteran of iraq and afghanistan mai actual exce the number of combat death __PUNCT__
think about that __PUNCT__
think about how onli half of the return soldier with ptsd receiv the treatment thei need __PUNCT__
think of how mani we turn awai __PUNCT__ of how mani we let fall through the crack __PUNCT__
we have to do better than thi __PUNCT__
in the senat __PUNCT__ i help lead a bipartisan effort to stop the unfair practic of kick out troop who suffer from them __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ we enhanc mental health screen and treatment at all level __PUNCT__ from enlist __PUNCT__ to deploy __PUNCT__ to reentri into civilian life __PUNCT__
we also need more mental health profession __PUNCT__ more train to recogn sign and to reject the stigma of seek care __PUNCT__
and we need to dramat improv screen and treatment for the other signatur injuri of the war __PUNCT__ traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__
that why i pass measur in the senat to increas screen for these injuri __PUNCT__ and that why i establish clearer standard of care as presid __PUNCT__
we have call on our troop and their famili for so much dure these last year __PUNCT__ but we haven't alwai issu that call respons __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we need to restor twelv month armi deploy __PUNCT__ but we also need to restor adequ train and time at home between those deploy __PUNCT__
my wife __PUNCT__ michel __PUNCT__ met with armi spous the other dai in north carolina who told her about the toll it take to watch your love on serv tour after tour of duti with littl to no time off in between __PUNCT__
and thei told her someth we all need to rememb __PUNCT__ we don't just deploi our troop oversea __PUNCT__ we deploi famili __PUNCT__
that why we also need to provid more counsel and resourc to help famili cope with multipl tour __PUNCT__
and when our love on do come home __PUNCT__ it is time for the unit state of america to offer thi gener of return hero the same thank we offer that earlier __PUNCT__ greatest gener __PUNCT__ by give everi veteran the same opportun that my grandfath had under the gi bill __PUNCT__
there is no reason we shouldn't pass the __NUM__ centuri gi bill that is be debat in congress right now __PUNCT__
it wa introduc by my friend senat jim webb __PUNCT__ a marin who serv as navi secretari under presid ronald reagan __PUNCT__
hi plan ha widespread support from republican and democrat __PUNCT__
it would provid everi return veteran with a real chanc to afford a colleg educ __PUNCT__ and it would not harm retent __PUNCT__
i have great respect for john mccain servic to thi countri and i know he love it dearli and honor those who serv __PUNCT__
but he is on of the few senat of either parti who oppos thi bill becaus he think it too gener __PUNCT__
i couldn't disagre more __PUNCT__
at a time when the skyrocket cost of tuition is price thousand of american out of a colleg educ __PUNCT__ we should be do everyth we can to give the men and women who have risk their live for thi countri the chanc to pursu the american dream __PUNCT__
the brave american who fight todai believ deepli in thi countri __PUNCT__
and no matter how mani you meet __PUNCT__ or how mani stori of heroism you hear __PUNCT__ everi encount remind that thei ar truli special __PUNCT__
that through their servic __PUNCT__ thei ar live out the ideal that stir so mani of us as america __PUNCT__ pride __PUNCT__ duti __PUNCT__ and sacrific __PUNCT__
some of the most inspir ar those you meet at place like walter reed armi medic center __PUNCT__
thei ar young men and women who mai have lost a limb or even their abil to take care of themselv __PUNCT__ but thei will never lose the pride thei feel for their countri __PUNCT__
thei not interest in self __PUNCT__ piti __PUNCT__ but yearn to move forward with their live __PUNCT__
and it thi classic american optim that make you realiz the qualiti of person we have serv in the unit state arm forc __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ is what led them to wear the uniform in the first place __PUNCT__ their unwav belief in the idea of america __PUNCT__
the idea that no matter where you come from __PUNCT__ or what you look like __PUNCT__ or who your parent ar __PUNCT__ thi is a place where anyth is possibl __PUNCT__ where anyon can make it __PUNCT__ where we look out for each other __PUNCT__ and take care of each other __PUNCT__ where we rise and fall as on nation __PUNCT__ as on peopl __PUNCT__
it an idea that worth fight for __PUNCT__ an idea for which so mani american have given that last full measur of devot __PUNCT__
i can still rememb the dai that we laid my grandfath to rest __PUNCT__
in a cemeteri line with the grave of american who have sacrif for our countri __PUNCT__ we heard the solemn note of tap and the crack of gun fire in salut __PUNCT__ we watch as a fold flag wa hand to my grandmoth and my grandfath wa laid to rest __PUNCT__
it wa a nation final act of servic and gratitud to stanlei dunham __PUNCT__ an america that stood by my grandfath when he took off the uniform __PUNCT__ and never left hi side __PUNCT__
abraham lincoln onc said __PUNCT__ i like to see a man proud of the place in which he live __PUNCT__
but i also like to see a man live so that hi place will be proud of him __PUNCT__
there is no doubt that we ar a nation that is deepli proud of where we live __PUNCT__
but it is now our gener task to live in a wai that stanlei dunham live __PUNCT__ to live the wai that those hero at walter reed have live __PUNCT__ the wai that all those men and women who put on thi nation uniform live each and everi dai __PUNCT__
it is now our task to live so that america will be proud of us __PUNCT__
that is true test of patriot __PUNCT__ the test that all of us must meet in the dai and year to come __PUNCT__
i have no doubt that thi nation is up to the challeng __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and mai god bless the unit state of america
