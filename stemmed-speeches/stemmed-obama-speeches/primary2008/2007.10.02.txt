thank you __PUNCT__ ted __PUNCT__
ted sorensen ha been counselor to a presid in some of our toughest moment __PUNCT__ and he ha help defin our nation purpos at pivot turn point __PUNCT__
let me also welcom all of the elect offici from illinoi who ar with us __PUNCT__
let me give a special welcom to all of the organ and speaker who join me to ralli against go to war in iraq five year ago __PUNCT__
and i want to thank depaul univers and depaul student for host thi event __PUNCT__
we come togeth at a time of renew for depaul __PUNCT__
a new academ year ha begun __PUNCT__
professor ar learn the name of new student __PUNCT__ and student ar remind that you actual do have to attend class __PUNCT__
that cold is begin to creep into the chicago air __PUNCT__
the season is chang __PUNCT__
depaul is now fill with student who have not spent a singl dai on campu without the realiti of a war in iraq __PUNCT__
four class have matricul and four class have graduat sinc thi war began __PUNCT__
and we ar remind that america son and daughter in uniform __PUNCT__ and their famili __PUNCT__ bear the heavi burden __PUNCT__
the wife of on soldier from illinoi wrote to me and said that her husband __PUNCT__ feel like he station in iraq and deploi home __PUNCT__
that a tragic statement __PUNCT__
and it could be echo by famili across our countri who have seen love on deploi to tour after tour of duti __PUNCT__
you ar student __PUNCT__
and the great respons of student is to question the world around you __PUNCT__ to question thing that don't add up __PUNCT__
with iraq __PUNCT__ we must ask the question __PUNCT__ how did we go so wrong __PUNCT__
there ar those who offer up easi answer __PUNCT__
thei will assert that iraq is georg bush war __PUNCT__ it all hi fault __PUNCT__
or that iraq wa botch by the arrog and incompet of donald rumsfeld and dick chenei __PUNCT__
or that we would have gotten iraq right if we went in with more troop __PUNCT__ or if we had a differ proconsul instead of paul bremer __PUNCT__ or if onli there were a stronger iraqi prime minist __PUNCT__
these ar the easi answer __PUNCT__
and like most easi answer __PUNCT__ thei ar partial true __PUNCT__
but thei don't tell the whole truth __PUNCT__ becaus thei overlook a harder and more fundament truth __PUNCT__
the hard truth is that the war in iraq is not about a catalog of mani mistak __PUNCT__ it is about on big mistak __PUNCT__
the war in iraq should never have been fought __PUNCT__
five year ago todai __PUNCT__ i wa ask to speak at a ralli against go to war in iraq __PUNCT__
the vote to author the war in congress wa less than ten dai awai and i wa a candid for the unit state senat __PUNCT__
some friend of mine advis me to keep quiet __PUNCT__
go to war in iraq __PUNCT__ thei point out __PUNCT__ wa popular __PUNCT__
all the other major candid were support the war at the time __PUNCT__
if the war goe well __PUNCT__ thei said __PUNCT__ you have thrown your polit career awai __PUNCT__
but i didn't see how saddam hussein pose an immin threat __PUNCT__
i wa convinc that a war would distract us from afghanistan and the real threat from al qaeda __PUNCT__
i worri that iraq histori of sectarian rivalri could leav us bog down in a bloodi conflict __PUNCT__
and i believ the war would fan the flame of extrem and lead to new terror __PUNCT__
so i went to the ralli __PUNCT__
and i argu against a __PUNCT__ rash war __PUNCT__ a __PUNCT__ war base not on reason __PUNCT__ but on polit __PUNCT__ an occup of undetermin length __PUNCT__ with undetermin cost __PUNCT__ and undetermin consequ __PUNCT__
i wa not alon __PUNCT__
though not a major __PUNCT__ million of american oppos give the presid the author to wage war in iraq __PUNCT__
twenti __PUNCT__ three senat __PUNCT__ includ the leader of the senat intellig committe __PUNCT__ share my concern and resist the march to war __PUNCT__
for us __PUNCT__ the war defi common sens __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ the peopl who hit us on 9/11 were in afghanistan __PUNCT__ not iraq __PUNCT__
but the convent think in washington ha a wai of bui into stori that make polit sens even if thei don't make practic sens __PUNCT__
we were told that the onli wai to prevent iraq from get nuclear weapon wa with militari forc __PUNCT__
some lead democrat echo the administr erron line that there wa a connect between saddam hussein and al qaeda __PUNCT__
we were counsel by some of the most experienc voic in washington that the onli wai for democrat to look tough wa to talk __PUNCT__ act and vote like a republican __PUNCT__
as ted sorensen old boss presid kennedi onc said __PUNCT__ the pursuit of peac is not as dramat as the pursuit of war __PUNCT__ and frequent the word of the pursuer fall on deaf ear __PUNCT__
in the fall of __NUM__ those deaf ear were in washington __PUNCT__
thei belong to a presid who didn't tell the whole truth to the american peopl __PUNCT__ who disdain diplomaci and bulli alli __PUNCT__ and who squander our uniti and the support of the world after 9/11 __PUNCT__
but it doesn't end there __PUNCT__
becaus the american peopl weren't just fail by a presid __PUNCT__ thei were fail by much of washington __PUNCT__
by a media that too often report spin instead of fact __PUNCT__
by a foreign polici elit that larg board the bandwagon for war __PUNCT__
and most of all by the major of a congress __PUNCT__ a coequal branch of govern __PUNCT__ that vote to give the presid the open __PUNCT__ end author to wage war that he us to thi dai __PUNCT__
let be clear __PUNCT__ without that vote __PUNCT__ there would be no war __PUNCT__
some seek to rewrit histori __PUNCT__
thei argu that thei weren't realli vote for war __PUNCT__ thei were vote for inspector __PUNCT__ or for diplomaci __PUNCT__
but the congress __PUNCT__ the administr __PUNCT__ the media __PUNCT__ and the american peopl all understood what we were debat in the fall of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi wa a vote about whether or not to go to war __PUNCT__
that the truth as we all understood it then __PUNCT__ and as we need to understand it now __PUNCT__
and we need to ask those who vote for the war __PUNCT__ how can you give the presid a blank check and then act surpris when he cash it __PUNCT__
with all that we know about what gone wrong in iraq __PUNCT__ even todai debat is divorc from realiti __PUNCT__
we got a surg that is somehow declar a success even though it ha fail to enabl the polit reconcili that wa it state purpos __PUNCT__
the fact that violenc todai is onli as horrif as in __NUM__ is held up as progress __PUNCT__
washington politician and pundit trip over each other to debat a newspap advertis while our troop fight and die in iraq __PUNCT__
and the convent think todai is just as entrench as it wa in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi is the convent think that measur experi onli by the year you been in washington __PUNCT__ not by your time spent serv in the wider world __PUNCT__
thi is the convent think that ha turn against the war __PUNCT__ but not against the habit that got us into the war in the first place __PUNCT__ the outdat assumpt and the refus to talk openli to the american peopl __PUNCT__
well i not run for presid to conform to washington convent think __PUNCT__ i run to challeng it __PUNCT__
i not run to join the kind of washington groupthink that led us to war in iraq __PUNCT__ i run to chang our polit and our polici so we can leav the world a better place than our gener ha found it __PUNCT__
so there is a choic that ha emerg in thi campaign __PUNCT__ on that the american peopl need to understand __PUNCT__
thei should ask themselv __PUNCT__ who got the singl most import foreign polici decis sinc the end of the cold war right __PUNCT__ and who got it wrong __PUNCT__
thi is not just a matter of debat the past __PUNCT__
it about who ha the best judgment to make the critic decis of the futur __PUNCT__
becaus you might think that washington would learn from iraq __PUNCT__
but we seen in thi campaign just how bent out of shape washington get when you challeng it assumpt __PUNCT__
when i said that as presid i would lead direct diplomaci with our adversari __PUNCT__ i wa call na√Øv and irrespons __PUNCT__
but how ar we go to turn the page on the fail bush __PUNCT__ chenei polici of not talk to our adversari if we don't have a presid who will lead that diplomaci __PUNCT__
when i said that we should take out high __PUNCT__ level terrorist like osama bin laden if we have action intellig about their whereabout __PUNCT__ i wa lectur by legion of iraq war support __PUNCT__
thei said we can't take out bin laden if the countri he hide in won't __PUNCT__
a few week later __PUNCT__ the co __PUNCT__ chairmen of the 9/11 commiss __PUNCT__ tom kean and lee hamilton __PUNCT__ agre with my posit __PUNCT__
but few in washington seem to notic __PUNCT__
some peopl made a differ argument on thi issu __PUNCT__
thei said we can take out bin laden __PUNCT__ we just can't sai that we will __PUNCT__
i reject thi __PUNCT__
i am a candid for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ and i believ that the american peopl have a right to know where i stand __PUNCT__
and when i said that we can rule out the us of nuclear weapon to take out a terrorist train camp __PUNCT__ it wa immedi brand a __PUNCT__ gaff __PUNCT__ becaus i did not recit the convent washington __PUNCT__ speak __PUNCT__
but is there ani militari planner in the world who believ that we need to drop a nuclear bomb on a terrorist train camp __PUNCT__
we need to question the world around us __PUNCT__
when we have a debat about experi __PUNCT__ we can't just debat who ha the most experi score polit point __PUNCT__
when we have a debat about experi __PUNCT__ we can't just talk about who fought yesterdai battl __PUNCT__ we have to focu on who can face the challeng and seiz the opportun of tomorrow __PUNCT__
becaus no matter what we think about georg bush __PUNCT__ he go to be gone in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
he not on the ballot __PUNCT__
thi elect is about end the iraq war __PUNCT__ but even more it about move beyond it __PUNCT__
and we not go be safe in a world of unconvent threat with the same old convent think that got us into iraq __PUNCT__
we not go to unifi a divid america to confront these threat with the same old convent polit of just try to beat the other side __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ we will have a window of opportun to renew our global leadership and bring our nation togeth __PUNCT__
if we don't seiz that moment __PUNCT__ we mai not get anoth __PUNCT__
thi elect is a turn point __PUNCT__
the american peopl get to decid __PUNCT__ ar we go to turn back the clock __PUNCT__ or turn the page __PUNCT__
i want to be straight with you __PUNCT__
if you want convent washington think __PUNCT__ i not your man __PUNCT__
if you want rigid ideolog __PUNCT__ i not your man __PUNCT__
if you think that fundament chang can wait __PUNCT__ i definit not your man __PUNCT__
but if you want to bring thi countri togeth __PUNCT__ if you want experi that broader than just learn the wai of washington __PUNCT__ if you think that the global challeng we face ar too urgent to wait __PUNCT__ and if you think that america must offer the world a new and hope face __PUNCT__ then i offer a differ choic in thi race and a differ vision for our futur __PUNCT__
the first thing we have to do is end thi war __PUNCT__
and the right person to end it is someon who had the judgment to oppos it from the begin __PUNCT__
there is no militari solut in iraq __PUNCT__ and there never wa __PUNCT__
i will begin to remov our troop from iraq immedi __PUNCT__
i will remov on or two brigad a month __PUNCT__ and get all of our combat troop out of iraq within __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
the onli troop i will keep in iraq will perform the limit mission of protect our diplomat and carri out target strike on al qaeda __PUNCT__
and i will launch the diplomat and humanitarian initi that ar so badli need __PUNCT__
let there be no doubt __PUNCT__ i will end thi war __PUNCT__
but it also time to learn the lesson of iraq __PUNCT__
we not go to defeat the threat of the __NUM__ centuri on a convent battlefield __PUNCT__
we cannot win a fight for heart and mind when we outsourc critic mission to unaccount contractor __PUNCT__
we not go to win a battl of idea with bullet alon __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ we must alwai be prepar to us forc to protect america __PUNCT__
but the best wai to keep america safe is not to threaten terrorist with nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ it to keep nuclear weapon and nuclear materi awai from terrorist __PUNCT__
that why i work with republican senat dick lugar to pass a law acceler our pursuit of loos nuclear materi __PUNCT__
and that why i lead a global effort to secur all loos nuclear materi dure my first term in offic __PUNCT__
but we need to do much more __PUNCT__
we need to chang our nuclear polici and our postur __PUNCT__ which is still focus on deter the soviet union __PUNCT__ a countri that doesn't exist __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ india and pakistan and north korea have join the club of nuclear __PUNCT__ arm nation __PUNCT__ and iran is knock on the door __PUNCT__
more nuclear weapon and more nuclear __PUNCT__ arm nation mean more danger to us all __PUNCT__
here what i sai as presid __PUNCT__ america seek a world in which there ar no nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we will not pursu unilater disarma __PUNCT__
as long as nuclear weapon exist __PUNCT__ we retain a strong nuclear deterr __PUNCT__
but we keep our commit under the nuclear non prolifer treati on the long road toward elimin nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we work with russia to take u. __PUNCT__ and russian ballist missil off hair __PUNCT__ trigger alert __PUNCT__ and to dramat reduc the stockpil of our nuclear weapon and materi __PUNCT__
we start by seek a global ban on the product of fissil materi for weapon __PUNCT__
and we set a goal to expand the u.s. __PUNCT__ russian ban on intermedi __PUNCT__ rang missil so that the agreement is global __PUNCT__
as we do thi __PUNCT__ we be in a better posit to lead the world in enforc the rule of the road if we firmli abid by those rule __PUNCT__
it time to stop give countri like iran and north korea an excus __PUNCT__
it time for america to lead __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we strengthen the nuclear non __PUNCT__ prolifer treati so that nation that don't compli will automat face strong intern sanction __PUNCT__
thi will requir a new era of american diplomaci __PUNCT__
to signal the dawn of that era __PUNCT__ we need a presid who is will to talk to all nation __PUNCT__ friend and foe __PUNCT__
i not afraid that america will lose a propaganda battl with a petti tyrant __PUNCT__ we need to go befor the world and win those battl __PUNCT__
if we take the attitud that the presid just parachut in for a photo __PUNCT__ op after an agreement ha alreadi been reach __PUNCT__ then we onli go to reach agreement with our friend __PUNCT__
that not the wai to protect the american peopl __PUNCT__
that not the wai to advanc our interest __PUNCT__
just look at our histori __PUNCT__
kennedi had a direct line to khrushchev __PUNCT__
nixon met with mao __PUNCT__
carter did the hard work of negoti the camp david accord __PUNCT__
reagan wa negoti arm agreement with gorbachev even as he call on him to __PUNCT__ tear down thi wall __PUNCT__
it time to make diplomaci a top prioriti __PUNCT__
instead of shutter consul __PUNCT__ we need to open them in the tough and hopeless corner of the world __PUNCT__
instead of have more american serv in militari band than the diplomat corp __PUNCT__ we need to grow our foreign servic __PUNCT__
instead of retreat from the world __PUNCT__ i will person lead a new chapter of american engag __PUNCT__
it is time to offer the world a messag of hope to counter the prophet of hate __PUNCT__
my experi ha brought me to the hopeless place __PUNCT__
as a boi __PUNCT__ i live in indonesia and plai barefoot with children who could not dream the same dream that i did __PUNCT__
as an adult __PUNCT__ i return to be with my famili in their small villag in kenya __PUNCT__ where the promis of america is still an inspir __PUNCT__
as a commun organ __PUNCT__ i work in south side neighborhood that had been left behind by global chang __PUNCT__
as a senat __PUNCT__ i been to refuge camp in chad where proud and dignifi peopl can't hope for anyth beyond the next handout __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ progress must mean more than a vote at the ballot box __PUNCT__ it must mean freedom from fear and freedom from want __PUNCT__
we cannot stand for the freedom of anarchi __PUNCT__
nor can we support the global of the empti stomach __PUNCT__
we need new approach to help peopl to help themselv __PUNCT__
the unit nation ha embrac the millennium develop goal __PUNCT__ which aim to cut extrem poverti in half by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ thei will be america goal __PUNCT__
the bush administr tri to keep the un from proclaim these goal __PUNCT__ the obama administr will doubl foreign assist to __MONEY__ billion to lead the world to achiev them __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we cannot stand up befor the world and sai that there on set of rule for america and anoth for everyon els __PUNCT__
to lead the world __PUNCT__ we must lead by exampl __PUNCT__
we must be will to acknowledg our fail __PUNCT__ not just trumpet our victori __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ we reject tortur __PUNCT__ without except or equivoc __PUNCT__ we close guantanamo __PUNCT__ we be the countri that credibl tell the dissid in the prison camp around the world that america is your voic __PUNCT__ america is your dream __PUNCT__ america is your light of justic __PUNCT__
we cannot __PUNCT__ we must not __PUNCT__ let the promot of our valu be a casualti of the iraq war __PUNCT__
but we cannot secur america and show our best face to the world unless we chang how we do busi in washington __PUNCT__
we all know what iraq ha cost us abroad __PUNCT__
but these last few year we seen an unaccept abus of power at home __PUNCT__
we face real threat __PUNCT__
ani presid need the latitud to confront them swiftli and sure __PUNCT__
but we paid a heavi price for have a presid whose prioriti is expand hi own power __PUNCT__
the constitut is treat like a nuisanc __PUNCT__
matter of war and peac ar us as polit tool to bludgeon the other side __PUNCT__
we get subject to endless spin to keep our troop at war __PUNCT__ but we don't get to see the flag __PUNCT__ drape coffin of our hero come home __PUNCT__
we get secret task forc __PUNCT__ secret budget __PUNCT__ slant intellig __PUNCT__ and the shame smear of peopl who speak out against the presid polici __PUNCT__
all of thi ha left us where we ar todai __PUNCT__ more divid __PUNCT__ more distrust __PUNCT__ more in debt __PUNCT__ and mire in an endless war __PUNCT__
a war to disarm a dictat ha becom an open __PUNCT__ end occup of a foreign countri __PUNCT__
thi is not america __PUNCT__
thi is not who we ar __PUNCT__
it time for us to stand up and tell georg bush that the govern in thi countri is not base on the whim of on person __PUNCT__ the govern is of the peopl __PUNCT__ by the peopl and for the peopl __PUNCT__
we thought we learn thi lesson __PUNCT__
after vietnam __PUNCT__ congress swore it would never again be dupe into war __PUNCT__ and even wrote a new law __PUNCT__ the war power act __PUNCT__ to ensur it would not repeat it mistak __PUNCT__
but no law can forc a congress to stand up to the presid __PUNCT__
no law can make senat read the intellig that show the presid wa overst the case for war __PUNCT__
no law can give congress a backbon if it refus to stand up as the co __PUNCT__ equal branch the constitut made it __PUNCT__
that is why it is not enough to chang parti __PUNCT__
it is time to chang our polit __PUNCT__
we don't need anoth presid who put polit and loyalti over candor __PUNCT__
we don't need anoth presid who think big but doesn't feel the need to tell the american peopl what thei think __PUNCT__
we don't need anoth presid who shut the door on the american peopl when thei make polici __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar not the problem in thi countri __PUNCT__ thei ar the answer __PUNCT__
and it time we had a presid who act like that __PUNCT__
i will alwai tell the american peopl the truth __PUNCT__
i will alwai tell you where i stand __PUNCT__
it what i do in thi campaign __PUNCT__
it what i do as presid __PUNCT__
i lead a new era of open __PUNCT__
i give an annual __PUNCT__ state of the world __PUNCT__ address to the american peopl in which i lai out our nation secur polici __PUNCT__
i draw on the legaci of on our greatest presid __PUNCT__ franklin roosevelt __PUNCT__ and give regular __PUNCT__ firesid webcast __PUNCT__ and i have member of my nation secur team do the same __PUNCT__
i turn the page on a grow empir of classifi inform __PUNCT__ and restor the balanc we lost between the necessarili secret and the necess of open in a democrat societi by creat a new nation declassif center __PUNCT__
we protect sourc and method __PUNCT__ but we won't us sourc and method as pretext to hide the truth __PUNCT__
our histori doesn't belong to washington __PUNCT__ it belong to america __PUNCT__
i us the intellig that i do receiv to make good polici __PUNCT__ i won't manipul it to sell a bad polici __PUNCT__
we don't need ani more offici who tell the presid what thei want to hear __PUNCT__
i will make the director of nation intellig an offici with a fix term __PUNCT__ like the chairman of the feder reserv __PUNCT__ not someon who can be fire by the presid __PUNCT__
we need consist and integr at the top of our intellig agenc __PUNCT__
we don't need polit __PUNCT__
my test won't be loyalti __PUNCT__ it will be the truth __PUNCT__
and i turn the page on the imperi presid that treat nation secur as a partisan issu __PUNCT__ not an american issu __PUNCT__
i will call for a stand __PUNCT__ bipartisan consult group of congression leader on nation secur __PUNCT__
i will meet with thi consult group everi month __PUNCT__ and consult with them befor take major militari action __PUNCT__
the buck will stop with me __PUNCT__
but these discuss have to take place on a bipartisan basi __PUNCT__ and support for these decis will be stronger if thei draw on bipartisan counsel __PUNCT__
we not go to secur thi countri unless we turn the page on the convent think that sai polit is just about beat the other side __PUNCT__
it time to unit america __PUNCT__ becaus we ar at an urgent and pivot moment __PUNCT__
there ar those who suggest that there ar easi answer to the challeng we face __PUNCT__
we can look __PUNCT__ thei sai __PUNCT__ to washington experi __PUNCT__ the same experi that got us into thi war __PUNCT__
or we can turn the page to someth new __PUNCT__ to unit thi countri and to seiz thi moment __PUNCT__
i am not a perfect man and i won't be a perfect presid __PUNCT__
but my own american stori tell me that thi countri move forward when we cast off our doubt and seek new begin __PUNCT__
it what brought my father across an ocean in search of a dream __PUNCT__
it what i saw in the ey of men and women and children in indonesia who heard the word __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__ and thought of the possibl beyond the horizon __PUNCT__
it what i saw in the street of the south side __PUNCT__ when peopl who had everi reason to give in decid to pick themselv up __PUNCT__
it what i seen in the unit state senat when republican and democrat of good will do come togeth to take on tough issu __PUNCT__
and it what i seen in thi campaign __PUNCT__ when over half a million american have come togeth to seek the chang thi countri need __PUNCT__
now i know that some will shake their head __PUNCT__
it easi to be cynic __PUNCT__
when it come to our foreign polici __PUNCT__ you get it from all side __PUNCT__
some folk on the right will tell you that you don't love your countri if you don't support the war in iraq __PUNCT__
some folk on the left will tell you that america can do no right in the world __PUNCT__
some shrug their shoulder becaus washington sai __PUNCT__ trust us __PUNCT__ we take care of it __PUNCT__
and we know happen the last time thei said that __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ it easi to be cynic __PUNCT__
but right now __PUNCT__ somewher in iraq __PUNCT__ there someon about your ag __PUNCT__
he mayb on hi second or third tour __PUNCT__
it hot __PUNCT__
he would rather be at home __PUNCT__
but he in hi uniform __PUNCT__ got hi combat gear on __PUNCT__
he get in a humve __PUNCT__
he go out on patrol __PUNCT__
he lost a buddi in thi war __PUNCT__ mayb more __PUNCT__
he risk hi life yesterdai __PUNCT__ he risk hi life todai __PUNCT__ and he go to risk it tomorrow __PUNCT__
so why do we reject the cynic __PUNCT__ we reject it becaus of men and women like him __PUNCT__
we reject it becaus the legaci of their sacrific must be a better america __PUNCT__
we reject it becaus thei embodi the spirit of those who fought to free the slave and free a contin from a madman __PUNCT__ who rebuilt europ and sent peac corp volunt around the globe __PUNCT__ becaus thei ar fight for a better america and a better world __PUNCT__
and i reject it becaus i wouldn't be on thi stage if __PUNCT__ throughout our histori __PUNCT__ america had not made the right choic over the easi choic __PUNCT__ the ambiti choic over the cautiou choic __PUNCT__
i wouldn't be here if i didn't think we were readi to move past the fight of the 1960 and the 1990 __PUNCT__
i wouldn't be here if __PUNCT__ time and again __PUNCT__ the torch had not been pass to a new gener __PUNCT__ to unit thi countri at home __PUNCT__ to show a new face of thi countri to the world __PUNCT__
i run for the presid of the unit state of america so that togeth we can do the hard work to seek a new dawn of peac and prosper for our children __PUNCT__ and for the children of the world __PUNCT__
