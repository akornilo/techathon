each year at thi time we honor and think about the father who been a part of our live __PUNCT__ the exampl thei set __PUNCT__ the sacrific thei made __PUNCT__ their success and their struggl __PUNCT__
i think about my grandfath __PUNCT__ who first becam a father when my mother wa born on a kansa armi base at the outset of world war ii __PUNCT__
he left to fight fascism in europ while my grandmoth stai behind and pitch in on a bomber assembl line __PUNCT__
with the nation still drag itself out of depress __PUNCT__ i imagin he must have felt uncertain at that time about what the futur held for hi famili __PUNCT__ and yet he return to a countri newli commit to opportun __PUNCT__ a countri that gave him a chanc to go to colleg on the gi bill __PUNCT__ bui a hous thank to the feder hous author __PUNCT__ and move west to hawaii to rais hi famili __PUNCT__
i also think about my father __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ fraser robinson __PUNCT__
he rais hi two children with hi wife marian in 1960 chicago __PUNCT__
thei face what other african __PUNCT__ american famili face at the time __PUNCT__ both hidden and overt form of racism that limit their opportun and requir more effort to get ahead __PUNCT__
and thei face an addit obstacl __PUNCT__
at ag __NUM__ fraser wa diagnos with multipl sclerosi __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ everi dai of hi life __PUNCT__ even when he had to reli on a walker to get him there __PUNCT__ he went to work at the local water filtrat plant while marian stai home with the children __PUNCT__
and on that singl salari __PUNCT__ fraser robinson provid for hi famili __PUNCT__ send my wife michel and her brother craig to princeton __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ though i did not know him well __PUNCT__ everi year around father dai i think of my own father __PUNCT__
he and my mother divorc when i wa onli two year old __PUNCT__ and for most of my life i knew him onli through the letter he sent and the stori my mother and grandpar told __PUNCT__
in hi absenc __PUNCT__ it wa more difficult for my mother to rais me and my sister on on salari dure the 1970 __PUNCT__ and we struggl __PUNCT__ at time turn to food stamp to get us through the month __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ through the support of my grandpar __PUNCT__ the sheer will and determin of my mother __PUNCT__ and the bless of gener scholarship __PUNCT__ i wa abl to attend some of the best school in the countri __PUNCT__ school that made it possibl for me to stand here todai __PUNCT__
it ha not been lost on either michel or myself that our famili stori ha been america stori __PUNCT__ a stori of opportun __PUNCT__ and possibl __PUNCT__ and the tireless pursuit of a dream that wa alwai within reach __PUNCT__
our parent and grandpar were given no guarante __PUNCT__ and thei certainli had their share of fail and hardship __PUNCT__ but their wa a countri where if you want it badli enough __PUNCT__ and were will to work for it __PUNCT__ and take respons __PUNCT__ you could provid for your famili and give your children the same chanc __PUNCT__
there ar fewer and fewer famili who can tell thi stori todai __PUNCT__
unlik my grandfath __PUNCT__ the brave soldier who return from iraq and afghanistan ar lucki if thei come home to a job that pai the bill __PUNCT__ or even the benefit and care thei earn as veteran __PUNCT__
blue __PUNCT__ collar worker like fraser robinson have seen their benefit declin __PUNCT__ and their union weaken __PUNCT__ and their wage flatten while the cost of everyth els rise __PUNCT__
and as mani of you know too well __PUNCT__ singl parent no longer have the support system that my mother did __PUNCT__ with too mani father financi unabl to help rais their children even if thei want to do the right thing __PUNCT__
over the last few decad __PUNCT__ fundament chang in the wai we work and live have trap too mani american famili between an economi that gone global and a govern that gone awol __PUNCT__
too mani rung have been remov from the ladder to middl __PUNCT__ class secur __PUNCT__ and the safeti net that suppos to break ani fall from that ladder ha grown badli frai __PUNCT__
mani famili face increas anxieti when it come to pai the bill or find wai to spend more time with their children __PUNCT__ while other have tumbl into poverti __PUNCT__ watch job disappear __PUNCT__ and father leav the home __PUNCT__
and even though the vast major of mother ar now work __PUNCT__ includ singl mother __PUNCT__ we haven't yet provid them with the support thei need to rais their children __PUNCT__
i don't have to give you a histori lesson in econom for you to know how thi all happen __PUNCT__ becaus mani of you have seen it or even live it __PUNCT__
you seen the factori close their door and move oversea __PUNCT__ leav too mani citi and mill town without their biggest sourc of employ __PUNCT__
i saw it when i first arriv in chicago in the earli 80 __PUNCT__ where i took a job help to rebuild neighborhood that had been devast by steel plant close __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ it not just factori job that ar disappear __PUNCT__
as countri like china and india churn out more worker who ar educ longer and better __PUNCT__ revolut in technolog and commun have made it possibl for american compani to autom some job and send other wherev there an internet connect __PUNCT__
the job that remain pai less and offer fewer benefit __PUNCT__ as employ have succeed in bust up union and cut back on health care and pension to stai competit with the compani abroad that ar pai their worker next to noth __PUNCT__
the weekli earn of american worker __PUNCT__ which had steadili risen dure the year our parent and grandpar were emploi __PUNCT__ have fallen more than twenti percent sinc __NUM__ and the minimum wage hasn't move in ten year __PUNCT__
thi mean that right now __PUNCT__ a famili of three with on minimum __PUNCT__ wage earner is still more than __MONEY__ below the poverti line __PUNCT__
most american ar vulner to these new risk __PUNCT__ but without a doubt __PUNCT__ the hardest hit have been those famili who were most vulner to begin with __PUNCT__
thei ar famili who live in inner __PUNCT__ citi and remot rural area __PUNCT__ thei ar disproportion african american and latino __PUNCT__
in the last six year __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ black male have lost job in the manufactur sector __PUNCT__ the highest rate of ani ethnic group __PUNCT__
in urban area __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of black men do not complet high school __PUNCT__
in on survei __PUNCT__ nearli on out of everi three african __PUNCT__ american famili said thei experienc at least on of three hardship in the last year __PUNCT__ overcrowd hous __PUNCT__ a lack of medic care __PUNCT__ or hunger __PUNCT__
without a job or an educ __PUNCT__ mani black men simpli cannot afford to rais a famili __PUNCT__ and too mani have made the sad choic not to __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all african __PUNCT__ american children live in singl __PUNCT__ parent household __PUNCT__ a number that ha doubl sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ mani singl mom __PUNCT__ includ the on who rais me __PUNCT__ do a heroic job on behalf of their kid __PUNCT__
but in an economi where a two __PUNCT__ incom famili ha becom a financi necess __PUNCT__ a fatherless household take it toll __PUNCT__
children who grow up without a father ar five time more like to live in poverti and nine time more like to drop out of school __PUNCT__
provid these famili with the same chanc that previou gener have had is a daunt challeng __PUNCT__ but it is certainli on we can meet __PUNCT__
mani of us here in thi room have seen how thi progress can be achiev __PUNCT__
all across thi state __PUNCT__ the south carolina center for father and famili ha help countless famili climb out from poverti by connect father employ opportun and encourag them to take respons for their children __PUNCT__
you have turn live around and you have given so mani children a better futur and for that you should feel veri proud __PUNCT__
i also been bless to see thi progress myself __PUNCT__
there wa a lot of hopeless in those south side neighborhood when i first arriv in chicago as a commun organ __PUNCT__
but we set up job train program and after school program and counsel program and after a while __PUNCT__ those neighborhood start to come around __PUNCT__
later __PUNCT__ when i becam a state senat in illinoi __PUNCT__ i made sure we expand the earn incom tax credit so we could put __MONEY__ million of tax cut into the pocket of work famili __PUNCT__
i made sure we provid health insur for anoth __NUM__ children and __NUM__ parent __PUNCT__
and we expand earli childhood educ to give kid the best possibl start in life __PUNCT__
so we know what need to be done when it come to give our famili a fight chanc __PUNCT__
and i think it time we final had a presid who get washington to start do it __PUNCT__
i don't know about you __PUNCT__ but i tire of hear that town tell us we can't __PUNCT__
for too long __PUNCT__ thei told us we can't do anyth about disappear job and stagnant wage __PUNCT__
thei told us that we can't lower our health care cost or the price of colleg tuition __PUNCT__
thei told us that poverti is a nuisanc to blame on the impoverish __PUNCT__ not a moral shame that should outrag a nation __PUNCT__
we assur that the market will correct all our misfortun __PUNCT__ and that there no problem that can't be solv by anoth tax break that the wealthi didn't need and didn't ask for __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we have tri it their wai for six year and we readi to try someth new __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page __PUNCT__
we ar not a countri that settl for surviv of the fittest __PUNCT__ but a peopl who have alwai fought for surviv of the nation __PUNCT__
that how we got a gi bill that sent a gener to colleg and creat the largest middl __PUNCT__ class in histori __PUNCT__
that how we gave worker the right to organ and form a union __PUNCT__
that how we got social secur and medicar so that american could retir in comfort and digniti __PUNCT__
now we have to do it again __PUNCT__
and it won't be easi __PUNCT__
we know that we can't put the forc of global back in the bottl __PUNCT__
we cannot bring back everi job that been lost __PUNCT__
we have to find a wai to make thi new economi work for us __PUNCT__
we also know that govern cannot meet thi challeng alon __PUNCT__ that there is not a program for everi problem we face __PUNCT__
it will take respons and sacrific from the american peopl __PUNCT__ chang in habit and attitud __PUNCT__
we will need to work more __PUNCT__ read more __PUNCT__ train more __PUNCT__ and think more __PUNCT__
parent will need to make sure their kid turn off the tv onc in a while __PUNCT__ and put awai the video game __PUNCT__ and start hit the book __PUNCT__
and there ar a lot of men out there who need to stop act like boi __PUNCT__ who need to realiz that respons doe not end at concept __PUNCT__ who need to know that what make you a man is not the abil to have a child but the courag to rais on __PUNCT__
but just as we have individu respons __PUNCT__ at the dawn of the __NUM__ centuri we also have a collect respons to strengthen that safeti net __PUNCT__ put the rung back on that ladder to the middl __PUNCT__ class __PUNCT__ and give everi famili the chanc that so mani of our parent and grandpar had __PUNCT__
thi respons is on that been miss from washington for far too long __PUNCT__ a respons i intend to take veri serious as presid __PUNCT__
we know what we need to do to help everi famili compet and prosper in a global world __PUNCT__
we know that we need to invest in the scienc and technolog that will make america the home for the high __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ wage job of tomorrow __PUNCT__
we know that to fill these job __PUNCT__ we also have to get seriou about educ our workforc for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
thi mean start our kid in school younger __PUNCT__ with more earli childhood educ opportun like the four year old kindergarten program you been try to pass here in south carolina __PUNCT__
it mean improv our public school by recruit thousand of new teacher and pai them more and ask more of them __PUNCT__
and it mean make colleg afford for everi american who want to go by offer more loan and bigger grant __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ in a world of increas risk and insecur __PUNCT__ we also know that everi american need a health care plan and a retir plan that stai with them no matter where thei work or even if thei can't find work __PUNCT__
that why a few week ago __PUNCT__ i introduc a univers health care plan that would not onli cover everi american by allow the uninsur to bui into a similar kind of plan that member of congress get themselv __PUNCT__ but it would cut cost and save a typic famili up to __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
so we know that we need thi broader agenda to help famili get ahead in thi new world __PUNCT__
but we also know that for the famili who been hit hardest by these econom chang __PUNCT__ we have to help them get start befor we can help them get ahead __PUNCT__ we have to empow them to grab that first rung of the ladder befor thei start climb __PUNCT__
that why todai i want to lai out a plan that would strengthen some of our most vulner famili by ensur that thei can find a job __PUNCT__ stai out of poverti __PUNCT__ and get the support thei need to rais their children __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to ensur that everyon who is will to work can find a job __PUNCT__
sinc south carolina ha lost __NUM__ manufactur job in the last six year and __NUM__ more peopl ar out of work __PUNCT__ thi certainli isn't easi __PUNCT__
but it a promis we have to keep in thi countri __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ for those american who have been search unsuccessfulli for employ __PUNCT__ i will invest __MONEY__ million in program that will place will worker into transit job and train them for perman on __PUNCT__
these program have alreadi proven to be highli success in the mani commun that have tri them __PUNCT__
peopl get the chanc to work in a commun servic __PUNCT__ type job __PUNCT__ earn a paycheck everi week __PUNCT__ and learn the skill thei need for gain employ __PUNCT__
and by leav with refer and a resum __PUNCT__ often time thei find that employ __PUNCT__
still __PUNCT__ even for those worker who do find a perman job __PUNCT__ mani time there is no wai for them to advanc their career onc thei in those job __PUNCT__
that why we also work with commun organ and busi to creat career pathwai that provid worker with the addit skill and train thei need to earn more monei and keep climb up that ladder to middl __PUNCT__ class secur __PUNCT__
union and variou commun have done thi quit successfulli __PUNCT__ and thi program would build on that model __PUNCT__
the second step we take to strengthen famili is to ensur that work american ar not impoverish american __PUNCT__
on of the most success anti __PUNCT__ poverti program in histori ha been the earn incom tax credit __PUNCT__ addit incom that lift nearli __NUM__ million american out of poverti everi year __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will doubl the number of singl worker who receiv the eitc and tripl the benefit for full __PUNCT__ time worker make the minimum wage __PUNCT__ from the __MONEY__ thei get todai to __MONEY__
and instead of wait everi ten year for congress to fight over rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__ i will final make the minimum wage a live wage by perman index it to inflat so that it actual pai the bill __PUNCT__
the third step we take to strengthen famili is to give them the support thei need to rais their children __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i start by pass the plan i outlin last year that would make it easier for father who make the respons choic and harder for those who avoid it __PUNCT__
it a plan that would remov some of the financi penalti the govern current impos on marri coupl __PUNCT__ cut out the red tape to ensur that everi dime of child support goe directli to children instead of bureaucrat __PUNCT__ and provid father who ar pai their child support an even larger eitc benefit __PUNCT__
thi plan would also crack down on those who avoid their respons by increas child __PUNCT__ support enforc __PUNCT__ a measur that will collect nearli __MONEY__ billion in payment that can help rais __PUNCT__ nurtur __PUNCT__ and educ children __PUNCT__
we should also help new mother with their new respons __PUNCT__
there is a pioneer nurs __PUNCT__ famili partnership program right now that offer home visit by train regist nurs to low __PUNCT__ incom mother and mother __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ be __PUNCT__
thei learn how to care for themselv befor the babi is born and what to do after __PUNCT__
thei ar counsel on substanc abus __PUNCT__ creat and achiev person goal __PUNCT__ and effect method of nurtur children __PUNCT__
where it been tri __PUNCT__ thi program reduc childhood injuri and unintend pregnanc __PUNCT__ increas father involv and women employ __PUNCT__ reduc us of welfar and food stamp __PUNCT__ and increas children school readi __PUNCT__
and it produc more than __MONEY__ in net save for everi high __PUNCT__ risk famili enrol in the program __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will expand the nurs __PUNCT__ famili partnership to provid at __PUNCT__ home nurs visit for up to __NUM__ first __PUNCT__ time mother each year __PUNCT__
my plan would also support famili with children by expand the child tax credit to an addit __NUM__ more american __PUNCT__ who would receiv __MONEY__ per child __PUNCT__
and for all those famili where both parent work and don't know what to do when their child ha to stai home sick for the dai __PUNCT__ my plan guarante everi worker seven paid dai of sick leav each year __PUNCT__
none of thi agenda will happen overnight __PUNCT__ nor will it be easi to get done __PUNCT__
but then again __PUNCT__ america stori hasn't been all that easi itself __PUNCT__
it is fill with tale of those who risk and struggl and beat the odd becaus thei knew that thi is a place __PUNCT__ perhap the onli place __PUNCT__ where such triumph is alwai possibl __PUNCT__
becaus thei believ that the pursuit of happi is not just a phrase in a declar __PUNCT__ but the found promis of our countri __PUNCT__ a promis that sustain our parent and grandpar through war and depress __PUNCT__ racial and social strife __PUNCT__ heartach and hardship __PUNCT__
it a promis that sustain thi gener still __PUNCT__
the other dai we heard from a young man name joshua stroman who from right here in south carolina __PUNCT__
joshua never knew hi father __PUNCT__ and when he wa veri young __PUNCT__ hi mom and stepfath both di from cancer __PUNCT__
he wa then taken in by famili member who were involv with gang and drug __PUNCT__
he experi with that lifestyl for a bit __PUNCT__ and hi low point came when he went to jail at eighteen year old __PUNCT__
that when he decid that hi stori would have a differ end __PUNCT__
he began to find comfort in hi faith __PUNCT__ and when he left jail __PUNCT__ he move in with an aunt who expect him to behav well and studi hard __PUNCT__
and he did __PUNCT__
he is now at benedict colleg and will be presid of the student council there next year __PUNCT__
but he told us that of everyth that out there __PUNCT__ hi biggest dream is to somedai stand in the front yard of hi own home with hi wife and kid __PUNCT__ who will hug him and sai __PUNCT__ i love you __PUNCT__ daddi __PUNCT__
it a dream that could not be simpler or more profound __PUNCT__ a dream that __PUNCT__ in some form or anoth __PUNCT__ ha probabl anim the journei that so mani father and mother and young men like josh have taken over the gener __PUNCT__
he ha turn hi life around becaus he held close the belief that it wa alwai within reach __PUNCT__
now it is our task to turn thi countri around so that we can prove to him and so mani other that thei were right all along __PUNCT__
i look forward to work with all of you in make thi happen __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
