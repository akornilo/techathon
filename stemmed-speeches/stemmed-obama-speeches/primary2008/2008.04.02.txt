we meet here at a time of challeng and uncertainti for america worker __PUNCT__
we all know the stori of shutter plant and rust factori __PUNCT__ of industri center that have becom near __PUNCT__ ghost town across thi state __PUNCT__ and across thi countri __PUNCT__
but todai gather isn't the first time worker have met in philadelphia at a pivot moment __PUNCT__
on hundr and eighti __PUNCT__ on year ago __PUNCT__ in the fall of __NUM__ a group of mechan met in the shadow of independ hall to form what thei call the mechan union of trade associ __PUNCT__ a moment that mark the birth of the trade union movement in america __PUNCT__
thei met all kind of resist from employ and wealthi merchant who said what thei were try to do would hurt worker and busi __PUNCT__ and wa just plain un __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__
but these mechan __PUNCT__ these found father of organ labor __PUNCT__ disagre __PUNCT__
and in the preambl to their constitut __PUNCT__ thei propos what mani believ wa a radic idea __PUNCT__ that it wa in their employ __PUNCT__ interest to pai them higher wage becaus higher wage for worker would help bring gener prosper for all __PUNCT__
it wa the __NUM__ centuri equival of the idea that what good for main street is good for wall street __PUNCT__
and that an idea we need to rememb todai __PUNCT__
becaus what we see is that anoth __PUNCT__ veri differ view ha taken hold in washington and on wall street __PUNCT__ the view that we can somehow thrive as a nation when those at the veri top ar do better than ever __PUNCT__ while ordinari american ar struggl to get by __PUNCT__
over the last seven year __PUNCT__ we had an administr that serv the interest of the wealthi and the well __PUNCT__ connect __PUNCT__ no matter what the cost to work famili __PUNCT__ and to our economi __PUNCT__
it an administr that didn't lift a finger while our economi roll toward recess until the pain folk were feel on main street trickl up to their friend on wall street __PUNCT__
it an administr that been hand out tax cut to the wealthiest american who don't need them and aren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
and it an administr that deni labor a seat at the tabl when trade deal ar be negoti __PUNCT__ that doesn't believ in union __PUNCT__ that doesn't believ in organ __PUNCT__ and that pack the labor relat board with their corpor buddi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ john mccain said a few week ago that __PUNCT__ the issu of econom is not someth i understood as well as i should __PUNCT__ and that clear sinc all he offer is more of the same bush polici that have put the american dream out of reach for so mani american __PUNCT__
like georg bush __PUNCT__ senat mccain is commit to more tax cut for the rich __PUNCT__ and more trade agreement that fail to protect american worker __PUNCT__
hi respons to the hous crisi amount to littl more than watch million of american face foreclosur __PUNCT__
and some of hi top advisor were lobbyist for the special interest when thei went to work for hi campaign __PUNCT__ so it not hard to guess who thei be work for if thei get into the white hous __PUNCT__
so while i know there been some talk about whether the democrat will be unifi in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ america can't afford anoth four year of the bush polici __PUNCT__ and that what john mccain offer __PUNCT__
and that why i know we come togeth thi fall to bring thi countri the chang we so desper need __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ the problem we face go beyond ani singl administr __PUNCT__
for far too long __PUNCT__ through both democrat and republican administr __PUNCT__ the system ha been rig against everydai american by the lobbyist that wall street us to get it wai __PUNCT__
think about it __PUNCT__
the top mortgag lender spend __MONEY__ million lobbi congress __PUNCT__ and we wonder why washington look the other wai when thei were trick famili into bui home thei couldn't afford __PUNCT__
drug and insur compani spend __MONEY__ billion on lobbi __PUNCT__ and we surpris that our health care premium __PUNCT__ and co __PUNCT__ pai __PUNCT__ and the cost of prescript drug goe up year after year after year __PUNCT__
the big oil compani plai the same game __PUNCT__ and we wonder how thei make record profit at a time when you pai close to __MONEY__ a gallon for ga __PUNCT__
the system is broken __PUNCT__ and over the weekend __PUNCT__ we got a remind of just how badli it broken __PUNCT__
you might have seen it __PUNCT__
there wa thi new stori about the top two execut at countrywid financi __PUNCT__ a compani that as respons as ani firm for the hous crisi we face todai __PUNCT__
and what we learn is that when countrywid wa sold a few month ago __PUNCT__ these two execut got a combin __NUM__ million dollar __PUNCT__
so million of american ar face foreclosur __PUNCT__
our economi is in turmoil __PUNCT__
and the gui behind it all ar get bonus for their bad behavior __PUNCT__
that an outrag __PUNCT__
that not the america we believ in __PUNCT__
it time to take on the special interest and level the plai field so that our economi work for work american __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i know there been some talk about rocki balboa over the last coupl dai __PUNCT__
and we all love rocki __PUNCT__
but rocki wa fiction __PUNCT__
and so is the idea that someon can fight for work peopl and at the same time __PUNCT__ embrac the broken system washington __PUNCT__ where corpor lobbyist us their clout to shape law to their like __PUNCT__
we need to challeng the system on behalf of america worker __PUNCT__
and if we not will to take up that fight __PUNCT__ then real chang __PUNCT__ chang that will make a last differ in the live of ordinari american __PUNCT__ will keep get block by the defend of the statu quo __PUNCT__
i believ i can bring about that kind of chang __PUNCT__ becaus i the onli candid in thi race who actual work to take power awai from lobbyist by pass histor ethic reform in illinoi and in the u. __PUNCT__ senat __PUNCT__
and i the onli candid who isn't take a dime from washington lobbyist __PUNCT__
thei have not fund my campaign __PUNCT__ thei will not run my administr __PUNCT__ and thei will not drown out the voic of the american peopl when i presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
your voic will be heard __PUNCT__
thi isn't just campaign talk __PUNCT__
i been fight for work famili ever sinc i move to chicago more than two decad ago to work as a commun organ __PUNCT__ give job train to the jobless and hope to the hopeless when the local steel plant close __PUNCT__
and the reason i stand here todai is becaus i don't want to wake up on morn mani year from now and see that noth ha chang becaus the system is still be rig against america famili __PUNCT__
and i know you don't either __PUNCT__
becaus despit seven year of the most anti __PUNCT__ labor administr in gener __PUNCT__ as i look out on thi crowd and as i travel across thi countri __PUNCT__ the on thing i know for certain is that labor union ar still mobil __PUNCT__
labor union ar still organ __PUNCT__
and you still fight to give america work peopl a voic in washington __PUNCT__
i tire of plai defens __PUNCT__
i know the afl __PUNCT__ cio is tire of plai defens __PUNCT__
we readi to plai some offens __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for a decent wage __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for retir secur __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for univers health care __PUNCT__
it time to stand up to the big drug and insur compani that have been block reform and sai enough is enough __PUNCT__ we go to final make health care afford and avail for everi american __PUNCT__
we go to final help folk like the young woman i met who work the night shift after a full dai of colleg and still can't afford medicin for a sister who ill __PUNCT__
no american should be driven into bankruptci try to pai their medic bill __PUNCT__
no worker should have to go without a pai rais becaus their employ ha to us the monei to cover the rise cost of health care __PUNCT__
that why we pass univers health care by the end of my first term as presid and save the typic famili up to __MONEY__ a year on their premium __PUNCT__
in thi countri of all countri __PUNCT__ health care shouldn't be a privileg for the few __PUNCT__ it should be a fundament right for everi american __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for organ labor __PUNCT__
it time we had a presid who didn't choke sai the word __PUNCT__ union __PUNCT__
a presid who know it the depart of labor and not the depart of manag __PUNCT__
and a presid who strengthen our union by let them do what thei do best __PUNCT__ organ our worker __PUNCT__
if a major of worker want a union __PUNCT__ thei should get a union __PUNCT__
it that simpl __PUNCT__
let stand up to the busi lobbi that been get their friend in washington to block card check __PUNCT__
i fought to pass the employe free choic act in the senat __PUNCT__
and i will make it the law of the land when i presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we readi to plai offens for work famili __PUNCT__
i the onli candid in thi race who call for a middl class tax cut that will save famili up to __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ includ over __NUM__ million peopl in thi state __PUNCT__
and i also call for elimin incom tax entir for senior make under __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__
and we also have to do more to make sure folk who ar get laid off in these hard time still have enough monei to make end meet __PUNCT__ which is why i work with my friend senat bob casei to extend unemploy insur __PUNCT__ and make it avail for work folk who aren't in a union and don't work a regular __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
but we also have to do more over the long __PUNCT__ term to invest in our middl class __PUNCT__
and that what we do as presid __PUNCT__
to ensur that our children have the skill to compet in our global economi __PUNCT__ we make colleg afford with a __MONEY__ tax credit for anyon who will to do some commun servic __PUNCT__
and we pass the patriot employ act that i been fight for ever sinc i ran for the senat __PUNCT__ so we can end tax break for compani that ship job oversea __PUNCT__ and give them to compani that creat good job with decent wage right here in america __PUNCT__
i also propos creat million of new job and do it in a wai that fiscal respons __PUNCT__
i call for invest __MONEY__ billion over the next ten year to rebuild our crumbl road and bridg __PUNCT__ and thi will gener million of new job __PUNCT__ mani of them in the construct industri that been hard hit by our hous crisi __PUNCT__
i also believ it time washington start show the same kind of leadership that pennsylvania labor movement ha shown by fight to creat the green job that ar the job of the futur __PUNCT__
that why i invest __MONEY__ billion over the next decad to establish a green energi sector that will creat up to __NUM__ million new job __PUNCT__ and those ar job that pai well and can't be outsourc __PUNCT__
and thank to leader like my friend congressman patrick murphi __PUNCT__ these kind of job ar bring new life back to place that have been hard hit in recent decad __PUNCT__ place like fairless hill in buck counti __PUNCT__ where the old u. __PUNCT__ steel plant is now be us to help produc wind power __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if we honest with ourselv __PUNCT__ we acknowledg that we can't stop global in it track and that open new market to our good can help strengthen our economi __PUNCT__
but what i refus to accept is that we have to sign trade deal like the south korea agreement that ar bad for american worker __PUNCT__
what i oppos __PUNCT__ and what i have alwai oppos __PUNCT__ ar trade deal that put the interest of multin corpor ahead of the interest of american worker __PUNCT__ like nafta __PUNCT__ and cafta __PUNCT__ and perman normal trade relat with china __PUNCT__
and i also oppos the colombia free trade agreement if presid bush insist on send it to congress becaus the violenc against union in colombia would make a mockeri of the veri labor protect that we have insist be includ in these kind of agreement __PUNCT__
so you can trust me when i sai that whatev trade deal we negoti when i presid will be good for american worker __PUNCT__ and that thei have strong labor and environment protect that we enforc __PUNCT__
these ar the battl we should be fight __PUNCT__
thi is the futur we should be build __PUNCT__
but it go to be hard to do all thi so long as we spend __MONEY__ billion a month fight a war in iraq that should have never been author and never been wage __PUNCT__
i oppos thi war from the start __PUNCT__
i oppos it each year it been go on __PUNCT__
and that why i the on candid who will offer a real choic in __DATE__ becaus i can stand up to john mccain with credibl and sai no to a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year occup of iraq __PUNCT__ and no to a third bush term __PUNCT__
it time to bring out troop home __PUNCT__
it time to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for good job and univers health care __PUNCT__
it time to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for a world __PUNCT__ class educ and social secur __PUNCT__
it time to end the fight in iraq and take up the fight for opportun and prosper here at home __PUNCT__
so make no mistak __PUNCT__ the american peopl have a choic in thi elect __PUNCT__
we can keep plai the same washington game with the same washington player __PUNCT__ and somehow expect a differ result __PUNCT__
or we can choos a differ futur __PUNCT__
just imagin it __PUNCT__
imagin a presid whose life stori is like so mani of your own __PUNCT__ who know what it like to go to colleg on student loan __PUNCT__ and see hi mother get sick and worri that mayb she can't pai the medic bill __PUNCT__
imagin a washington where the onli lobbi that ha real influenc is the peopl lobbi __PUNCT__
a washington where you can trust that your voic will be heard befor ani major piec of labor legisl is sign into law __PUNCT__
imagin an america that live up to the idea that those mechan propos nearli two hundr year ago __PUNCT__ where we final have a system that work for main street and not just wall street __PUNCT__
that the chang we seek __PUNCT__
that the vision the afl __PUNCT__ cio ha alwai fought for __PUNCT__
and that the futur that within our grasp __PUNCT__
so i ask you to march with me __PUNCT__ and work with me __PUNCT__ and fight with me __PUNCT__
and if you do __PUNCT__ then i truli believ we won't just win thi primari __PUNCT__ and we won't just defeat john mccain in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we build an america where labor is on the rise __PUNCT__ where hope is on the rise __PUNCT__ and where the american dream is within reach for everi famili in thi countri __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
