it a privileg to be a part of todai convoc and an honor to receiv thi degre from howard __PUNCT__
there ar few other univers that have plai so central a role in break down yesterdai barrier and inch thi countri closer to the ideal we see inscrib on the monument throughout thi citi __PUNCT__
it wa howard that sent the first african __PUNCT__ american to the unit state senat __PUNCT__
it wa howard that graduat the first african __PUNCT__ american to becom governor and the first to becom mayor of the largest citi in the countri __PUNCT__
it wa here __PUNCT__ within the hall of thi campu __PUNCT__ where thurgood marshal huddl with the brilliant mind of hi dai to craft the argument in brown v __PUNCT__ board that ignit a movement that chang the world __PUNCT__
and it is becaus of these victori that a black man name barack obama can stand befor you todai as a candid for presid of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
but i am not just run to make histori __PUNCT__
i run becaus i believ that togeth __PUNCT__ we can chang histori cours __PUNCT__
it not enough just to look back in wonder of how far we come __PUNCT__ i want us to look ahead with a fierc urgenc at how far we have left to go __PUNCT__
i believ it time for thi gener to make it own mark __PUNCT__ to write our own chapter in the american stori __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ those who came befor us did not strike a blow against injustic onli so that we would allow injustic to fester in our time __PUNCT__
thurgood marshal did not argu brown so that we would accept a countri where too mani african __PUNCT__ american men end up in prison becaus we rather spend more to jail a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old than to educ a five __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ king did not take us to the mountaintop so that we would allow a terribl storm to ravag those who were strand in the vallei __PUNCT__ he would not have expect that it would take a breach in our leve to reveal a breach in our compass __PUNCT__ that it would take a hurrican to reveal the hungri god ask us to feed __PUNCT__ the sick he ask us to care for __PUNCT__ the least of these he command us to treat as our own __PUNCT__
the teenag and colleg student who left their home to march in the street of birmingham and montgomeri __PUNCT__ the mother who walk instead of take the bu after a long dai of do somebodi els laundri and clean somebodi els kitchen __PUNCT__ thei didn't brave fire hose and billi club so that their grandchildren and their great __PUNCT__ grandchildren would still wonder at the begin of the __NUM__ centuri whether their vote would be count __PUNCT__ whether their civil right would be protect by their govern __PUNCT__ whether justic would be equal and opportun would be their __PUNCT__
and i am certain that nine children did not walk through the door of a school in littl rock so that our children would have to see noos hang at a school in louisiana __PUNCT__
we have more work to do __PUNCT__
it a fit remind that the fiftieth anniversari of littl rock fell on thi week __PUNCT__
becaus when the door to that school final open __PUNCT__ a nation respond __PUNCT__
the presid sent the unit state armi to stand on the side of justic __PUNCT__
the congress pass the civil right act of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the depart of justic creat a civil right divis __PUNCT__
and million of american took to the street in the follow month and year so that more children could walk through more door __PUNCT__
these were not easi choic to make at the time __PUNCT__
presid eisenhow wa warn by some that send the armi down to littl rock would be polit suicid __PUNCT__
the resist to civil right reform wa fierc __PUNCT__
and we know that those who march for freedom did so at great risk to themselv and their famili __PUNCT__
but thei did it becaus thei understood that sometim there ar moment when what truli riski is not to act __PUNCT__
what truli riski is to let the same injustic remain year after year __PUNCT__
what truli riski is to walk awai and pretend it never happen __PUNCT__
what truli riski is to accept thing as thei ar instead of work for what could be __PUNCT__
in a media __PUNCT__ driven cultur that more obsess with who beat who in washington and how long pari hilton is go to jail __PUNCT__ these moment ar harder to spot todai __PUNCT__
but everi so often __PUNCT__ thei do appear __PUNCT__
sometim it take a hurrican __PUNCT__
and sometim it take a travesti of justic like the on we seen in jena __PUNCT__ louisiana __PUNCT__
there ar some who will make jena about the fight itself __PUNCT__
and it true that we have to do more as parent to instil in our children that violenc is alwai wrong __PUNCT__
it wrong when it happen on the street of chicago and it wrong when it happen at a schoolyard in louisiana __PUNCT__
violenc is not the answer __PUNCT__
non __PUNCT__ violenc wa the soul of the civil right movement __PUNCT__ and we have to do a better job of teach our children that virtu __PUNCT__
but we also know that to truli understand jena __PUNCT__ you have to look at what happen both befor and after that fight __PUNCT__
you have to listen to the hate slur that flew through the hall of a school __PUNCT__
you have to know the full measur of the damag done by that arson __PUNCT__
you have to look at those noos hang on that schoolyard tree __PUNCT__
and you have to understand how badli our system of justic fail those six boi in the dai after that fight __PUNCT__ the outrag charg __PUNCT__ the unreason and excess sentenc __PUNCT__ the public defend who did not call a singl wit __PUNCT__
like katrina did with poverti __PUNCT__ jena expos glare inequ in our justic system that were around long befor that schoolyard fight broke out __PUNCT__
it remind us of the fact that we have a system that lock awai too mani young __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ violent offend for the better part of their live __PUNCT__ a decis that made not by a judg in a courtroom __PUNCT__ but by politician in washington __PUNCT__
it remind us that we have certain sentenc that ar base less on the kind of crime you commit than on what you look like and where you come from __PUNCT__
it remind us that we have a justic depart whose idea of prosecut civil right violat is try to rollback affirm action program at our colleg and univers __PUNCT__ a justic depart whose idea of prosecut vote right violat is to look for vote fraud in black and latino commun where it doesn't exist __PUNCT__
we know these inequ ar there __PUNCT__
we know thei wrong __PUNCT__
and yet thei go larg unnot until peopl find the courag to stand up and sai thei wrong __PUNCT__
until someon final sai __PUNCT__ it wrong that scooter libbi get no jail time for compromis our nation secur __PUNCT__ but a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old honor student is still sit in a georgia prison for someth that wasn't even a feloni __PUNCT__
that wrong __PUNCT__
it not alwai easi to stand up and sai thi __PUNCT__
i commend those of you here at howard who have spoken out on jena __NUM__ or travel to the ralli in louisiana __PUNCT__
i commend those of you who spoken out on the genarlow wilson case __PUNCT__
i know it can be lone protest thi kind of injustic __PUNCT__
i know there not a lot of glamour in it __PUNCT__
when i wa a state senat in illinoi __PUNCT__ we had a death penalti system that had sent thirteen innoc peopl to death row __PUNCT__
thirteen innoc men __PUNCT__ that we know of __PUNCT__
i want to reform the system __PUNCT__
and i wa told by almost everyon that it wasn't possibl __PUNCT__
that i wouldn't be abl to get polic offic and civil right advoc __PUNCT__ democrat and republican to all agre that we should videotap confess to make sure thei weren't coerc __PUNCT__
folk told me that there wa too much polit risk involv __PUNCT__
but i believ that it wa too riski not to act __PUNCT__
and after awhil peopl with oppos view came togeth and start listen __PUNCT__
and we end up reform that death penalti system __PUNCT__
and we did the same thing when i pass a law to expos racial profil __PUNCT__
so don't ever let anyon tell you that chang isn't possibl __PUNCT__
don't let them tell you that speak out and stand up against injustic is too riski __PUNCT__
what too riski is keep quiet __PUNCT__
what too riski is look the other wai __PUNCT__
i don't want to be stand here and talk about anoth jena four year from now becaus we didn't have the courag to act todai __PUNCT__
i don't want thi to be anoth issu that end up be ignor onc the camera ar turn off and the headlin disappear __PUNCT__
it time to seek a new dawn of justic in america __PUNCT__
from the dai i take offic as presid __PUNCT__ america will have a justic depart that is truli dedic to the work it began in the dai after littl rock __PUNCT__
i will rid the depart of ideologu and polit croni __PUNCT__ and for the first time in eight year __PUNCT__ the civil right divis will actual be staf with civil right lawyer who prosecut civil right violat __PUNCT__ and employ discrimin __PUNCT__ and hate crime __PUNCT__
and we have a vote right section that actual defend the right of everi american to vote without decept or intimid __PUNCT__
when flyer ar place in our neighborhood tell peopl to vote on the wrong dai __PUNCT__ that won't onli be an injustic __PUNCT__ it will be a crime __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will also work everi dai to ensur that thi countri ha a crimin justic system that inspir trust and confid in everi american __PUNCT__ regardless of ag __PUNCT__ or race __PUNCT__ or background __PUNCT__
there no reason that everi singl person accus of a crime shouldn't have a qualifi public attornei to defend them __PUNCT__
we recruit more public defend to the profess by forgiv colleg and law school loan __PUNCT__ and i will ask some of the brilliant mind here at howard to take advantag of that offer __PUNCT__
there also no reason we can't pass a racial profil law like i did in illinoi __PUNCT__ or encourag state to reform the death penalti so that innoc peopl do not end up on death row __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we will no longer accept the fals choic between be tough on crime and vigil in our pursuit of justic __PUNCT__
dr __PUNCT__ king said it not either __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ it both __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__
we can have a crime polici that both tough and smart __PUNCT__
if you convict of a crime involv drug __PUNCT__ of cours you should be punish __PUNCT__
but let not make the punish for crack cocain that much more sever than the punish for powder cocain when the real differ between the two is the skin color of the peopl us them __PUNCT__
judg think that wrong __PUNCT__
republican think that wrong __PUNCT__
democrat think that wrong __PUNCT__ and yet it been approv by republican and democrat presid becaus no on ha been will to brave the polit and make it right __PUNCT__
that will end when i am presid __PUNCT__
i think it time we also took a hard look at the wisdom of lock up some first __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ violent drug user for decad __PUNCT__
someon onc said that __PUNCT__ __URL__ minimum sentenc for first __PUNCT__ time user mai not be the best wai to occupi jail space and/or heal peopl from their diseas __PUNCT__
that someon wa georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__ six year ago __PUNCT__
i don't sai thi veri often __PUNCT__ but i agre with the presid __PUNCT__
the differ is __PUNCT__ he hasn't done anyth about it __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__
we will review these sentenc to see where we can be smarter on crime and reduc the blind and counterproduct wareh of non __PUNCT__ violent offend __PUNCT__
and we will give first __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ violent drug offend a chanc to serv their sentenc __PUNCT__ where appropri __PUNCT__ in the type of drug rehabilit program that have proven to work better than a prison term in chang bad behavior __PUNCT__
so let reform thi system __PUNCT__
let do what smart __PUNCT__
let do what just __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there is no doubt that take these step will restor a measur of justic and equal to america __PUNCT__
thei will also restor a sens of confid to the american peopl that the system doesn't just work __PUNCT__ it work for everyon __PUNCT__
but there is a broader point i want to make todai __PUNCT__
if i have the opportun to lead thi nation __PUNCT__ i will alwai be a presid who hear your voic and understand your concern __PUNCT__ a presid whose stori is like so mani of your own __PUNCT__ whose life work ha been the unfinish work of our long march toward justic __PUNCT__
and i will stand up for you __PUNCT__ and fight for you __PUNCT__ and wake up everi dai think about how to make your live better __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ on man cannot make a movement __PUNCT__
no singl law can eras the prejudic in the heart of a child who hang a noos on a tree __PUNCT__ or the callous of a prosecutor who bypass justic in the pursuit of vengeanc __PUNCT__
no on leader __PUNCT__ no matter how shrewd or experienc __PUNCT__ can prevent teenag from kill other teenag on the street of our citi __PUNCT__ or free our neighborhood from the grip of hopeless __PUNCT__ or make real the promis of opportun and equal for everi citizen __PUNCT__
onli a countri can do these thing __PUNCT__
onli thi countri can do these thing __PUNCT__
and that is why if you give me the chanc to serv thi nation __PUNCT__ the most import thing i will do as your presid is ask you to serv it too __PUNCT__
the most import thing i do is call on you everi dai to take a risk and do your part to carri thi movement forward __PUNCT__
against great odd and amidst deep cynic __PUNCT__ i will ask you to believ again that we can right the wrong we see in america __PUNCT__
i would not have driven out to chicago after colleg to organ jobless neighborhood if i didn't believ thi wa possibl __PUNCT__
i wouldn't have organ a voter registr drive __PUNCT__ or becom a civil right lawyer __PUNCT__ or a constitut law professor __PUNCT__ or a state senat __PUNCT__ or a u. __PUNCT__ senat if i didn't believ thi wa possibl __PUNCT__
i would not be stand here todai if i didn't believ thi wa possibl __PUNCT__
and i know that you believ it possibl too __PUNCT__
on of the most inspir thing about the respons to jena wa that it did not begin with the action of ani on leader __PUNCT__
the call went out to thousand across the internet and black radio and on colleg campus like thi on __PUNCT__
and like the young american of anoth era __PUNCT__ you left your home __PUNCT__ and got on buse __PUNCT__ and travel south __PUNCT__
it what happen two year earlier when student here at howard and american from everi walk of life took it upon themselv to try and rescu a citi that wa drown __PUNCT__
it how real chang and true justic have alwai come about __PUNCT__
it take a movement to lift a nation __PUNCT__
it will take a movement to go into our citi and sai that it not enough to just fix our crimin justic system __PUNCT__ what we realli need is to make sure that our kid don't end up there in the first place __PUNCT__
we need to set up child care and after school program and job train and drug counsel to give our children a place to turn to __PUNCT__
and we need parent to start act like parent and spend more time with their children and read to them onc in awhil __PUNCT__
it will take a movement to finish what began in topeka __PUNCT__ kansa and littl rock __PUNCT__ arkansa __PUNCT__
it will take a movement of american from everi citi and town __PUNCT__ of everi race and background to stand up and sai that no matter what you look like or where you come from __PUNCT__ everi child in america should have the opportun to receiv the best educ thi countri ha to offer __PUNCT__
everi child __PUNCT__
it will take a movement to demand that we rebuild our crumbl school __PUNCT__ that we invest in earli childhood educ __PUNCT__ that we recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and support them more __PUNCT__
it will take a movement to ensur that everi young person get the chanc that howard gave all of you __PUNCT__ to sai that at the begin of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ a colleg educ is no longer a luxuri for those who can afford it __PUNCT__ it is the birthright of everi american __PUNCT__
so when you go back to your classroom and your dorm room and you begin anoth year at howard univers __PUNCT__ i ask you to rememb how far we come __PUNCT__ but i urg you to think hard about where we need to go __PUNCT__
i urg you to think about the risk you will take and the role you will plai in build the movement that will get us there __PUNCT__
and i ask you rememb the stori of mose and joshua __PUNCT__
most of you know that mose wa call by god to lead hi peopl to the promis land __PUNCT__
and in the face of a pharaoh and hi armi __PUNCT__ across an unforgiv desert and along the wall of an angri sea __PUNCT__ he succeed in lead hi peopl out of bondag in egypt __PUNCT__
he led them through great danger __PUNCT__ and thei got far enough so that mose could point the wai toward freedom on the far bank of the river jordan __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ it wa not in god plan to have mose cross the river __PUNCT__
instead he would call on joshua to finish the work that mose began __PUNCT__
he would ask joshua to take hi peopl that final distanc __PUNCT__
everyon in thi room stand on the shoulder of mani mose __PUNCT__
thei ar the courag men and women who march and fought and bled for the right and freedom we enjoi todai __PUNCT__
thei have taken us mani mile over an imposs journei __PUNCT__
but you ar member of the joshua gener __PUNCT__
and it is now up to you to finish the work that thei began __PUNCT__
it is up to you to cross the river __PUNCT__
when joshua discov the challeng he face __PUNCT__ he had hi doubt and hi worri __PUNCT__
but the lord told joshua not to fear __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ be strong and have courag __PUNCT__ for i am with you wherev you go __PUNCT__
those ar the word i will leav you with todai __PUNCT__
be strong and have courag __PUNCT__
be strong and have courag in the face of injustic __PUNCT__
be strong and have courag in the face of prejudic and hatr __PUNCT__
be strong and have courag in the face of jobless and helpless and hopeless __PUNCT__
be strong and have courag __PUNCT__ in the face of our doubt and fear __PUNCT__ in the face of skeptic __PUNCT__ in the face of cynic __PUNCT__ in the face of a mighti river __PUNCT__
be strong and have courag and let us cross over to that promis land togeth __PUNCT__
congratul on anoth year __PUNCT__ and thank you so much __PUNCT__
