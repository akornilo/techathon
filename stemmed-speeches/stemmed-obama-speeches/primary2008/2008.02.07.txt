it good to be back in new orlean __PUNCT__
i just sorri that i a few dai late for mardi gra __PUNCT__
new orlean is a citi that ha alwai shown america what is possibl when we have the imagin to see the unseen __PUNCT__ and the determin to work for it __PUNCT__
it a citi where slave met in congo squar to rais their voic in improb joi __PUNCT__ and a young man name loui from __PUNCT__ back of town __PUNCT__ plai hi first tune __PUNCT__
it a citi where jackson turn back the british __PUNCT__ and a great port connect america heartland to the gulf __PUNCT__
it a citi where race and religion and languag all mix togeth to form someth new __PUNCT__ someth differ __PUNCT__ and someth special __PUNCT__ an imperfect place made more perfect through it promis of forgiv __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ in the wake of thi quintessenti american citi greatest test __PUNCT__ we see the stir of a new dai __PUNCT__
thi great univers is well into anoth academ year __PUNCT__
the st __PUNCT__ charl streetcar is rattl downtown __PUNCT__
the endymion __PUNCT__ en __PUNCT__ dim' __PUNCT__ ee __PUNCT__ uhn __PUNCT__ parad again wind through the street of mid __PUNCT__ citi __PUNCT__
a son of new orlean __PUNCT__ eli man __PUNCT__ even won an improb super bowl victori __PUNCT__
most importantli __PUNCT__ with each pass dai __PUNCT__ with each student who goe to school __PUNCT__ with each busi that open it door __PUNCT__ with each worker who put in a shift __PUNCT__ new orleanian ar reclaim their futur __PUNCT__ and show america just what can be done in thi countri when citizen lift up their commun __PUNCT__
but there is anoth side to thi stori __PUNCT__
becaus we know that thi citi __PUNCT__ a citi that ha alwai stood for what can be done in thi countri __PUNCT__ ha also becom a symbol for what we could not do __PUNCT__
to mani american __PUNCT__ the word __PUNCT__ new orlean __PUNCT__ call up imag of broken leve __PUNCT__ water rush through the street __PUNCT__ mother hold babi up to avoid the flood __PUNCT__
and wors __PUNCT__ the memori of a moment when america govern fail it citizen __PUNCT__
becaus when the peopl of new orlean and the gulf coast extend their hand for help __PUNCT__ help wasn't there __PUNCT__
when peopl look up from the rooftop __PUNCT__ for too long thei saw empti sky __PUNCT__
when the wind blew and the floodwat came __PUNCT__ we learn that for all of our wealth and power __PUNCT__ someth wasn't right with america __PUNCT__
we can talk about what happen for a few dai in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and we should __PUNCT__
we can talk about leve that couldn't hold __PUNCT__ about a fema that seem not just incompet __PUNCT__ but paralyz and powerless __PUNCT__ about a presid who onli saw the peopl from the window of an airplan __PUNCT__
we can talk about a trust that wa broken __PUNCT__ the promis that our govern will be prepar __PUNCT__ will protect us __PUNCT__ and will respond in a catastroph __PUNCT__
but we also know the broken promis did not start when a storm hit __PUNCT__ and thei did not end there __PUNCT__
when presid bush came down to jackson squar two week after the storm __PUNCT__ the set wa spectacular and hi promis soar __PUNCT__ we will do what it take __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we will stai as long as it take __PUNCT__ to help citizen rebuild their commun and their live __PUNCT__
but over two year later __PUNCT__ those word have been caught in a tangl of half __PUNCT__ measur __PUNCT__ half __PUNCT__ heart leadership __PUNCT__ and red tape __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ part of new orlean ar come back to life __PUNCT__
but we also know that over __NUM__ famili ar still live in small trailer __PUNCT__ that thousand of home sit empti and condemn __PUNCT__ and that school and hospit and firehous ar shutter __PUNCT__
we know that even though the street car run __PUNCT__ there ar fewer passeng __PUNCT__ that even though the parad sound their joy nois __PUNCT__ there is too much violenc in the shadow __PUNCT__
to confront these challeng we have to understand that katrina mai have batter these shore __PUNCT__ but it also expos silent storm that have ravag part of thi citi and our countri for far too long __PUNCT__
the storm of poverti and jobless __PUNCT__ inequ and injustic __PUNCT__
when i wa down in houston visit evacue a few dai after katrina __PUNCT__ i met a woman in the reliant center who had long known these storm in her life __PUNCT__
she told me __PUNCT__ we had noth befor the hurrican __PUNCT__
now we got less than noth __PUNCT__
we had noth befor the hurrican __PUNCT__
now we got less than noth __PUNCT__
i think about her sometim __PUNCT__
i think about how america left her behind __PUNCT__
and i wonder where she is todai __PUNCT__
america fail that woman long befor that failur show up on our televis screen __PUNCT__
we fail her again dure katrina __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ tragic __PUNCT__ we ar fail her for a third time __PUNCT__
that need to chang __PUNCT__
it time for us to restor our trust with her __PUNCT__ it time for america to rebuild trust with the peopl of new orlean and the gulf coast __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will start by restor that most basic trust __PUNCT__ that your govern will do what it take to keep you safe __PUNCT__
the word __PUNCT__ never again __PUNCT__ spoken so often in those week after katrina __PUNCT__ must not fade to a whisper __PUNCT__
the armi corp of engin ha rebuilt leve that were most damag by the storm __PUNCT__ but fund ha sometim stall __PUNCT__ and new orlean remain unprotect __PUNCT__
we can't gambl everi hurrican season __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will finish build a system of leve that can withstand a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year storm by __NUM__ with the goal of expand that protect to defend against a categori __NUM__ storm __PUNCT__
we also have to restor natur barrier __PUNCT__ the wetland __PUNCT__ marsh and barrier island that can take the first blow and protect the peopl of the gulf coast __PUNCT__
if catastroph come __PUNCT__ the american peopl must be abl to call on a compet govern __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ the dai of dysfunct and cronyism in washington will be over __PUNCT__
the director of fema will report to me __PUNCT__
he or she will have the highest qualif in emerg manag __PUNCT__
and i won't just tell you that i insul that offic from polit __PUNCT__ i guarante it __PUNCT__ by give my fema director a fix term like the director of the feder reserv __PUNCT__
i don't want fema to be think for on minut about the polit of a crisi __PUNCT__
i want fema to do it job __PUNCT__ which is protect the american peopl __PUNCT__ not protect a presid polit __PUNCT__
and as soon as we take offic __PUNCT__ my fema director will work with emerg manag offici in all fifti state to creat a nation respons plan __PUNCT__
becaus we need to know __PUNCT__ befor disast come __PUNCT__ who will be in charg __PUNCT__ and how the feder __PUNCT__ state and local govern will work togeth to respond __PUNCT__
but put up defens is not suffici __PUNCT__
becaus renew trust with the peopl of new orlean is not just about stronger leve and pump system __PUNCT__ it about peopl __PUNCT__
so mani of us live a life that is order __PUNCT__ with comfort we can count on __PUNCT__
somewher __PUNCT__ we know __PUNCT__ there ar peopl who don't have a hous with a sturdi roof __PUNCT__ who have nowher to go when thei can't make rent __PUNCT__ who don't have a car to drive to anoth citi when a storm is come __PUNCT__ who can't get care when thei sick __PUNCT__ or get the educ that would give them a chanc at their dream __PUNCT__
but too often __PUNCT__ we lose our sens of common destini __PUNCT__ that understand that we ar all ti togeth __PUNCT__ that when a woman ha less than noth in thi countri __PUNCT__ that make us all poorer __PUNCT__
that is why the second thing we need to do is to make sure that reconstruct is make a real differ in peopl __PUNCT__ live __PUNCT__
across thi citi __PUNCT__ we see the evid that georg bush promis were empti __PUNCT__
it not accept that feder monei is not reach commun that need it __PUNCT__ or that louisiana offici have fill out million of form to get reconstruct fund __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ the feder rebuild coordin will report directli to me __PUNCT__ and we will ensur that resourc show result __PUNCT__
it time to cut the red tape __PUNCT__ so that the feder govern is a partner __PUNCT__ not an oppon __PUNCT__ in get thing done __PUNCT__
instead of give no __PUNCT__ bid contract to compani head by the presid former campaign manag __PUNCT__ we will make sure that rebuild benefit the local economi __PUNCT__
i have work across the aisl in the senat to crack down on no __PUNCT__ bid contract __PUNCT__ and to make sure that emerg contract is onli done immedi after an emerg __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ if there is a job that can be done by a new orlean resid __PUNCT__ the contract will go to a resid of new orlean __PUNCT__
and we provid tax incent to busi that choos to set up shop in the hardest hit area __PUNCT__
instead of let famili languish in trailer __PUNCT__ we will ensur that everi displac resid can return to a home __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ ten of thousand of homeown could end up without assist becaus of fund shortfal __PUNCT__
that is unaccept __PUNCT__
we must work with louisiana to make the road home program more effici __PUNCT__
we should set a goal to approv everi applic for road home assist within two month __PUNCT__
and we need to increas rental properti __PUNCT__ so that we can bring down the cost of rent a home __PUNCT__
instead of shutter hospit and provid shortag __PUNCT__ we will help the gulf region rebuild a health care system that serv all it resid __PUNCT__
we provid incent like loan forgiv to bring more doctor and nurs to new orlean __PUNCT__ and we build new hospit __PUNCT__ includ a new medic center downtown __PUNCT__ and a state __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the art veteran hospit __PUNCT__
and instead of unsaf street and shock crime __PUNCT__ we will help new orlean rebuild it crimin justic system __PUNCT__
we start a new cop for katrina program to put more resourc into commun polic __PUNCT__ so that heroic offic __PUNCT__ men and women like nicola cotton __PUNCT__ who gave her life serv the citi she love __PUNCT__ have more support __PUNCT__
and we launch a region effort that bring togeth feder __PUNCT__ state and local resourc to combat crime and drug gang across the gulf coast __PUNCT__
the children of new orlean ar america children __PUNCT__
we cannot stand by while thei see a futur fill with violenc __PUNCT__ or poverti __PUNCT__ or hopeless __PUNCT__
our true measur of success must be ensur that the children of new orlean and the gulf coast can dream the same dream as everi child in america __PUNCT__
that is why the third part of our effort to rebuild trust must be provid a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
over two year after katrina __PUNCT__ too mani school ar still close __PUNCT__
kid ar still go to class in makeshift build and trailer __PUNCT__
class size run as larg as forti children for each teacher __PUNCT__
thi is not accept __PUNCT__
it time for fema to speed up payment of the __MONEY__ million that congress recent alloc for school repair __PUNCT__
and it time to invest in educ __PUNCT__ so that new orlean ha the first __PUNCT__ class school system that it ha need for so long __PUNCT__
that start with the person stand in front of the classroom __PUNCT__
mani heroic __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ qualiti teacher have return to new orlean __PUNCT__ but we need more __PUNCT__
that is why i have call for __MONEY__ million to bring qualiti teacher back to the gulf region __PUNCT__
ani teacher or princip who commit to come here for three year should receiv an annual bonu __PUNCT__ and those who teach in subject area where we face shortag __PUNCT__ such as math and scienc __PUNCT__ should receiv an addit bonu __PUNCT__
in new orlean __PUNCT__ and across thi countri __PUNCT__ we need to stop talk about how great our teacher ar __PUNCT__ we need to reward them for their great with more pai and more support __PUNCT__
we need to recruit new teacher by help them pai for a colleg educ __PUNCT__
we need to expand mentor program to pair experienc teacher with new recruit __PUNCT__
and we need to help them move up the career ladder and gain new skill __PUNCT__
we can't accept an educ polici where we pass a law call no child left behind and leav the monei behind __PUNCT__
and we can't just have our teacher teach to a test __PUNCT__ we need to encourag scienc and innov __PUNCT__ music and the art __PUNCT__
if there is ani citi in the world that show us the valu of cultur and creativ __PUNCT__ it is new orlean __PUNCT__
and our commit to educ can't stop with a high school diploma __PUNCT__
i have fought in the senat for post __PUNCT__ katrina support for xavier __PUNCT__ southern and dillard __PUNCT__
and i put forward a loan forgiv program __PUNCT__ to make it easier for student to come back to tulan and colleg and univers across the gulf region __PUNCT__
it time to make a colleg educ afford __PUNCT__ not just in new orlean __PUNCT__ but for all american __PUNCT__
that why i give student who need a hand an annual __MONEY__ tax credit if you will to do your part by serv your commun __PUNCT__
and we need to tap the tremend resourc of commun colleg __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we reward school that graduat more student __PUNCT__
and we help our school determin what skill ar need to help local industri __PUNCT__ so that graduat ar well __PUNCT__ prepar to lift up the economi __PUNCT__ and to rebuild their commun __PUNCT__
becaus the trust we seek is not a on __PUNCT__ wai street __PUNCT__
it go to take folk work togeth and do their part __PUNCT__
the govern cannot rebuild the gulf coast for the peopl of the gulf coast __PUNCT__ the govern can onli rebuild the gulf coast with the peopl of thi region __PUNCT__
all of thi will cost monei __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha alreadi promis the resourc __PUNCT__ but thei need to be spent more effici and more wise __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will target fund to program that make a differ __PUNCT__ and make sure that resourc meet the need of the peopl __PUNCT__ and that mean work close with state and local offici __PUNCT__ and ask that thei keep up their end of the bargain __PUNCT__
i promis you that when i in the white hous i will commit myself everi dai to keep up washington end of thi trust __PUNCT__
thi will be a prioriti of my presid __PUNCT__
and i will make it clear to member of my administr that their respons don't end in place like the __NUM__ ward __PUNCT__ thei begin there __PUNCT__
but i will also ask the peopl of thi citi to do your part __PUNCT__
becaus togeth __PUNCT__ we can do more than rebuild a citi __PUNCT__ we can creat a model for america __PUNCT__ for how we prepar for disast __PUNCT__ for how we fight poverti __PUNCT__ for how we put our kid on a pathwai to success __PUNCT__
if we do thi __PUNCT__ then we can onc again make new orlean the citi that stand for what we can do in america __PUNCT__ not a symbol for what we can't do __PUNCT__
if we do thi __PUNCT__ then we can begin to turn the page on the invis barrier __PUNCT__ the silent storm __PUNCT__ that have ravag thi citi and thi countri __PUNCT__ the old divis of black and white __PUNCT__ of rich and poor __PUNCT__
it time to leav that to yesterdai __PUNCT__
it time to choos tomorrow __PUNCT__
here at tulan __PUNCT__ your degre will open up mani door __PUNCT__
i hope that mani of you will choos to stai here in new orlean __PUNCT__ and to make thi work your own __PUNCT__
becaus you ar the chang that thi citi seek __PUNCT__
you can be thi citi tomorrow __PUNCT__
you can help close those divis __PUNCT__
and by do so __PUNCT__ you can help to heal thi nation __PUNCT__
what better place to begin thi work than new orlean __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ in the citi that gave us jazz __PUNCT__ we know that even the most pain note can be follow by joi __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ in thi citi __PUNCT__ if we look hard enough __PUNCT__ we can imagin the unseen __PUNCT__ home fill with famili __PUNCT__ busi put folk to work __PUNCT__ school extend opportun __PUNCT__ the next vers in the american song __PUNCT__
that is what is possibl if we can trust each other __PUNCT__ and if we have the imagin to see the unseen __PUNCT__ and the determin to work for it __PUNCT__
