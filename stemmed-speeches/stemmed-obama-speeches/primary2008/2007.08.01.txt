thank you lee __PUNCT__ for host me here at the wilson center __PUNCT__ and for your leadership of both the 9/11 commiss and the iraq studi group __PUNCT__
you have been a steadi voic of reason in an unsteadi time __PUNCT__
let me also sai that my thought and prayer ar with your colleagu __PUNCT__ haleh esfandiari __PUNCT__ and her famili __PUNCT__
i have made my posit known to the iranian govern __PUNCT__
it is time for haleh to be releas __PUNCT__
it is time for haleh to come home __PUNCT__
it came dure what the commiss call the __PUNCT__ summer of threat __PUNCT__ when the __PUNCT__ system wa blink red __PUNCT__ about an impend attack __PUNCT__
but despit the brief __PUNCT__ mani felt the danger wa oversea __PUNCT__ a threat to embassi and militari instal __PUNCT__
the extrem __PUNCT__ the resent __PUNCT__ the terrorist train camp __PUNCT__ and the killer were in the dark corner of the world __PUNCT__ far awai from the american homeland __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ on bright and beauti tuesdai morn __PUNCT__ thei were here __PUNCT__
i wa drive to a state legisl hear in downtown chicago when i heard the new on my car radio __PUNCT__ a plane had hit the world trade center __PUNCT__
by the time i got to my meet __PUNCT__ the second plane had hit __PUNCT__ and we were told to evacu __PUNCT__
peopl gather in the street and look up at the sky and the sear tower __PUNCT__ transform from a workplac to a target __PUNCT__
we fear for our famili and our countri __PUNCT__
we mourn the terribl loss suffer by our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
back at my law offic __PUNCT__ i watch the imag from new york __PUNCT__ a plane vanish into glass and steel __PUNCT__ men and women cling to windowsil __PUNCT__ then let go __PUNCT__ tall tower crumbl to dust __PUNCT__
it seem all of the miseri and all of the evil in the world were in that roll black cloud __PUNCT__ block out the __DATE__ sun __PUNCT__
what we saw that morn forc us to recogn that in a new world of threat __PUNCT__ we ar no longer protect by our own power __PUNCT__
and what we saw that morn wa a challeng to a new gener __PUNCT__
the histori of america is on of tragedi turn into triumph __PUNCT__
and so a war over secess becam an opportun to set the captiv free __PUNCT__
an attack on pearl harbor led to a wave of freedom roll across the atlant and pacif __PUNCT__
an iron curtain wa punctur by democrat valu __PUNCT__ new institut at home __PUNCT__ and strong intern partnership abroad __PUNCT__
after 9/11 __PUNCT__ our call wa to write a new chapter in the american stori __PUNCT__
to devis new strategi and build new allianc __PUNCT__ to secur our homeland and safeguard our valu __PUNCT__ and to serv a just caus abroad __PUNCT__
we were readi __PUNCT__
american were unit __PUNCT__
friend around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us __PUNCT__
we had the might and moral __PUNCT__ suasion that wa the legaci of gener of american __PUNCT__
the tide of histori seem pois to turn __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ toward hope __PUNCT__
but then everyth chang __PUNCT__
we did not finish the job against al qaeda in afghanistan __PUNCT__
we did not develop new capabl to defeat a new enemi __PUNCT__ or launch a comprehens strategi to dry up the terrorist __PUNCT__ base of support __PUNCT__
we did not reaffirm our basic valu __PUNCT__ or secur our homeland __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we got a color __PUNCT__ code polit of fear __PUNCT__
patriot as the possess of on polit parti __PUNCT__
the diplomaci of refus to talk to other countri __PUNCT__
a rigid __NUM__ centuri ideolog that insist that the __NUM__ centuri stateless terror could be defeat through the invas and occup of a state __PUNCT__
a deliber strategi to misrepres 9/11 to sell a war against a countri that had noth to do with 9/11 __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ a littl more than a year after that bright __DATE__ dai __PUNCT__ i wa in the street of chicago again __PUNCT__ thi time speak at a ralli in opposit to war in iraq __PUNCT__
i did not oppos all war __PUNCT__ i said __PUNCT__
i wa a strong support of the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
but i said i could not support __PUNCT__ a dumb war __PUNCT__ a rash war __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__
i worri about a __PUNCT__ u. __PUNCT__ occup of undetermin length __PUNCT__ at undetermin cost __PUNCT__ with undetermin consequ __PUNCT__ in the heart of the muslim world __PUNCT__
i plead that we __PUNCT__ finish the fight with bin ladin and al qaeda __PUNCT__
the polit wind were blow in a differ direct __PUNCT__
the presid wa determin to go to war __PUNCT__
there wa just on obstacl __PUNCT__ the u. __PUNCT__ congress __PUNCT__
nine dai after i spoke __PUNCT__ that obstacl wa remov __PUNCT__
congress rubber __PUNCT__ stamp the rush to war __PUNCT__ give the presid the broad and open __PUNCT__ end author he us to thi dai __PUNCT__
with that vote __PUNCT__ congress becam co __PUNCT__ author of a catastroph war __PUNCT__
and we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield __PUNCT__ with no appreci of how mani enemi we would creat __PUNCT__ and no plan for how to get out __PUNCT__
becaus of a war in iraq that should never have been author and should never have been wage __PUNCT__ we ar now less safe than we were befor 9/11 __PUNCT__
accord to the nation intellig estim __PUNCT__ the threat to our homeland from al qaeda is __PUNCT__ persist and evolv __PUNCT__
iraq is a train ground for terror __PUNCT__ torn apart by civil war __PUNCT__
afghanistan is more violent than it ha been sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
al qaeda ha a sanctuari in pakistan __PUNCT__
israel is besieg by embolden enemi __PUNCT__ talk openli of it destruct __PUNCT__
iran is now present the broadest strateg challeng to the unit state in the middl east in a gener __PUNCT__
group affili with or inspir by al qaeda oper worldwid __PUNCT__
six year after 9/11 __PUNCT__ we ar again in the midst of a __PUNCT__ summer of threat __PUNCT__ with bin ladin and mani more terrorist determin to strike in the unit state __PUNCT__
what more __PUNCT__ in the dark hall of abu ghraib and the detent cell of guantanamo __PUNCT__ we have compromis our most preciou valu __PUNCT__
what could have been a call to a gener ha becom an excus for uncheck presidenti power __PUNCT__
a tragedi that unit us wa turn into a polit wedg issu us to divid us __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page __PUNCT__
it is time to write a new chapter in our respons to 9/11 __PUNCT__
just becaus the presid misrepres our enemi doe not mean we do not have them __PUNCT__
the terrorist ar at war with us __PUNCT__
the threat is from violent extremist who ar a small minor of the world __NUM__ billion muslim __PUNCT__ but the threat is real __PUNCT__
thei distort islam __PUNCT__
thei kill man __PUNCT__ woman and child __PUNCT__ christian and hindu __PUNCT__ jew and muslim __PUNCT__
thei seek to creat a repress caliph __PUNCT__
to defeat thi enemi __PUNCT__ we must understand who we ar fight against __PUNCT__ and what we ar fight for __PUNCT__
the presid would have us believ that everi bomb in baghdad is part of al qaeda war against us __PUNCT__ not an iraqi civil war __PUNCT__
he elev al qaeda in iraq __PUNCT__ which didn't exist befor our invas __PUNCT__ and overlook the peopl who hit us on 9/11 __PUNCT__ who ar train new recruit in pakistan __PUNCT__
he lump togeth group with veri differ goal __PUNCT__ al qaeda and iran __PUNCT__ shiit militia and sunni insurg __PUNCT__
he confus our mission __PUNCT__
and wors __PUNCT__ he is fight the war the terrorist want us to fight __PUNCT__
bin ladin and hi alli know thei cannot defeat us on the field of battl or in a genuin battl of idea __PUNCT__
but thei can provok the reaction we seen in iraq __PUNCT__ a misguid invas of a muslim countri that spark new insurg __PUNCT__ ti down our militari __PUNCT__ bust our budget __PUNCT__ increas the pool of terrorist recruit __PUNCT__ alien america __PUNCT__ give democraci a bad name __PUNCT__ and prompt the american peopl to question our engag in the world __PUNCT__
by refus to end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ presid bush is give the terrorist what thei realli want __PUNCT__ and what the congress vote to give them in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ a u. __PUNCT__ occup of undetermin length __PUNCT__ at undetermin cost __PUNCT__ with undetermin consequ __PUNCT__
it is time to turn the page __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will wage the war that ha to be won __PUNCT__ with a comprehens strategi with five element __PUNCT__ get out of iraq and on to the right battlefield in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__ develop the capabl and partnership we need to take out the terrorist and the world most deadli weapon __PUNCT__ engag the world to dry up support for terror and extrem __PUNCT__ restor our valu __PUNCT__ and secur a more resili homeland __PUNCT__
the first step must be get off the wrong battlefield in iraq __PUNCT__ and take the fight to the terrorist in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
i introduc a plan in __DATE__ that would have alreadi start bring our troop out of iraq __PUNCT__ with a goal of remov all combat brigad by __DATE__ __PUNCT__
if the presid continu to veto thi plan __PUNCT__ then end thi war will be my first prioriti when i take offic __PUNCT__
there is no militari solut in iraq __PUNCT__
onli iraq leader can settl the grievanc at the heart of iraq civil war __PUNCT__
we must appli pressur on them to act __PUNCT__ and our best leverag is reduc our troop presenc __PUNCT__
and we must also do the hard and sustain diplomat work in the region on behalf of peac and stabil __PUNCT__
in end the war __PUNCT__ we must act with more wisdom than we start it __PUNCT__
that is why my plan would maintain suffici forc in the region to target al qaeda within iraq __PUNCT__
but we must recogn that al qaeda is not the primari sourc of violenc in iraq __PUNCT__ and ha littl support __PUNCT__ not from shia and kurd who al qaeda ha target __PUNCT__ or sunni tribe hostil to foreign __PUNCT__
on the contrari __PUNCT__ al qaeda appeal within iraq is enhanc by our troop presenc __PUNCT__
end the war will help isol al qaeda and give iraqi the incent and opportun to take them out __PUNCT__
it will also allow us to direct badli need resourc to afghanistan __PUNCT__
our troop have fought valiantli there __PUNCT__ but iraq ha depriv them of the support thei need __PUNCT__ and deserv __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ part of afghanistan ar fall into the hand of the taliban __PUNCT__ and a mix of terror __PUNCT__ drug __PUNCT__ and corrupt threaten to overwhelm the countri __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i would deploi at least two addit brigad to afghanistan to re __PUNCT__ enforc our counter __PUNCT__ terror oper and support nato effort against the taliban __PUNCT__
as we step up our commit __PUNCT__ our european friend must do the same __PUNCT__ and without the burdensom restrict that have hamper nato effort __PUNCT__
we must also put more of an afghan face on secur by improv the train and equip of the afghan armi and polic __PUNCT__ and includ afghan soldier in u. __PUNCT__ and nato oper __PUNCT__
we must not __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ repeat the mistak of iraq __PUNCT__
the solut in afghanistan is not just militari __PUNCT__ it is polit and econom __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i would increas our non __PUNCT__ militari aid by __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
these resourc should fund project at the local level to impact ordinari afghan __PUNCT__ includ the develop of altern livelihood for poppi farmer __PUNCT__
and we must seek better perform from the afghan govern __PUNCT__ and support that perform through tough anti __PUNCT__ corrupt safeguard on aid __PUNCT__ and increas intern support to develop the rule of law across the countri __PUNCT__
abov all __PUNCT__ i will send a clear messag __PUNCT__ we will not repeat the mistak of the past __PUNCT__ when we turn our back on afghanistan follow soviet withdraw __PUNCT__
as 9/11 show us __PUNCT__ the secur of afghanistan and america is share __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ that secur is most threaten by the al qaeda and taliban sanctuari in the tribal region of northwest pakistan __PUNCT__
al qaeda terrorist train __PUNCT__ travel __PUNCT__ and maintain global commun in thi safe __PUNCT__ haven __PUNCT__
the taliban pursu a hit and run strategi __PUNCT__ strike in afghanistan __PUNCT__ then skulk across the border to safeti __PUNCT__
thi is the wild frontier of our global world __PUNCT__
there ar wind __PUNCT__ swept desert and cave __PUNCT__ dot mountain __PUNCT__
there ar tribe that see border as noth more than line on a map __PUNCT__ and govern as forc that come and go __PUNCT__
there ar blood ti deeper than allianc of conveni __PUNCT__ and pocket of extrem that follow religion to violenc __PUNCT__
it a tough place __PUNCT__
but that is no excus __PUNCT__
there must be no safe __PUNCT__ haven for terrorist who threaten america __PUNCT__
we cannot fail to act becaus action is hard __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i would make the hundr of million of dollar in u. __PUNCT__ militari aid to pakistan condit __PUNCT__ and i would make our condit clear __PUNCT__ pakistan must make substanti progress in close down the train camp __PUNCT__ evict foreign fighter __PUNCT__ and prevent the taliban from us pakistan as a stage area for attack in afghanistan __PUNCT__
i understand that presid musharraf ha hi own challeng __PUNCT__
but let me make thi clear __PUNCT__
there ar terrorist hole up in those mountain who murder __NUM__ american __PUNCT__
thei ar plot to strike again __PUNCT__
it wa a terribl mistak to fail to act when we had a chanc to take out an al qaeda leadership meet in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
if we have action intellig about high __PUNCT__ valu terrorist target and presid musharraf won't act __PUNCT__ we will __PUNCT__
and pakistan need more than f __PUNCT__ 16 to combat extrem __PUNCT__
as the pakistani govern increas invest in secular educ to counter radic madrasa __PUNCT__ my administr will increas america commit __PUNCT__
we must help pakistan invest in the provinc along the afghan border __PUNCT__ so that the extremist __PUNCT__ program of hate is met with on of hope __PUNCT__
and we must not turn a blind ey to elect that ar neither free nor fair __PUNCT__ our goal is not simpli an alli in pakistan __PUNCT__ it is a democrat alli __PUNCT__
beyond pakistan __PUNCT__ there is a core of terrorist __PUNCT__ probabl in the ten of thousand __PUNCT__ who have made their choic to attack america __PUNCT__
so the second step in my strategi will be to build our capac and our partnership to track down __PUNCT__ captur or kill terrorist around the world __PUNCT__ and to deni them the world most danger weapon __PUNCT__
i will not hesit to us militari forc to take out terrorist who pose a direct threat to america __PUNCT__
thi requir a broader set of capabl __PUNCT__ as outlin in the armi and marin corp new counter __PUNCT__ insurg manual __PUNCT__
i will ensur that our militari becom more stealth __PUNCT__ agil __PUNCT__ and lethal in it abil to captur or kill terrorist __PUNCT__
we need to recruit __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ and equip our arm forc to better target terrorist __PUNCT__ and to help foreign militari to do the same __PUNCT__
thi must includ a program to bolster our abil to speak differ languag __PUNCT__ understand differ cultur __PUNCT__ and coordin complex mission with our civilian agenc __PUNCT__
to succe __PUNCT__ we must improv our civilian capac __PUNCT__
the finest militari in the world is adapt to the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
but it cannot counter insurg and terrorist threat without civilian counterpart who can carri out econom and polit reconstruct mission __PUNCT__ sometim in danger place __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will strengthen these civilian capac __PUNCT__ recruit our best and brightest to take on thi challeng __PUNCT__
i will increas both the number and capabl of our diplomat __PUNCT__ develop expert __PUNCT__ and other civilian who can work alongsid our militari __PUNCT__
we can't just sai there is no militari solut to these problem __PUNCT__
we need to integr all aspect of american might __PUNCT__
on compon of thi integr approach will be new mobil develop team that bring togeth personnel from the state depart __PUNCT__ the pentagon __PUNCT__ and usaid __PUNCT__
these team will work with civil societi and local govern to make an immedi impact in peopl __PUNCT__ live __PUNCT__ and to turn the tide against extrem __PUNCT__
where peopl ar most vulner __PUNCT__ where the light of hope ha grown dark __PUNCT__ and where we ar in a posit to make a real differ in advanc secur and opportun __PUNCT__ that is where these team will go __PUNCT__
i will also strengthen our intellig __PUNCT__
thi is about more than an organiz chart __PUNCT__
we need leadership that forc our agenc to share inform __PUNCT__ and leadership that never __PUNCT__ ever __PUNCT__ twist the fact to support bad polici __PUNCT__
but we must also build our capac to better collect and analyz inform __PUNCT__ and to carri out oper to disrupt terrorist plot and break up terrorist network __PUNCT__
thi cannot just be an american mission __PUNCT__
al qaeda and it alli oper in nearli __NUM__ countri __PUNCT__
the unit state cannot steal everi secret __PUNCT__ penetr everi cell __PUNCT__ act on everi tip __PUNCT__ or track down everi terrorist __PUNCT__ nor should we have to do thi alon __PUNCT__
thi is not just about our secur __PUNCT__
it is about the common secur of all the world __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will creat a share secur partnership program to forg an intern intellig and law enforc infrastructur to take down terrorist network from the remot island of indonesia __PUNCT__ to the sprawl citi of africa __PUNCT__
thi program will provid __MONEY__ billion over three year for counter __PUNCT__ terror cooper with countri around the world __PUNCT__ includ inform share __PUNCT__ fund for train __PUNCT__ oper __PUNCT__ border secur __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ corrupt program __PUNCT__ technolog __PUNCT__ and target terrorist financ __PUNCT__
and thi effort will focu on help our partner succe without repress tactic __PUNCT__ becaus brutal breed terror __PUNCT__ it doe not defeat it __PUNCT__
we must also do more to safeguard the world most danger weapon __PUNCT__
we know al qaeda seek a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we know thei would not hesit to us on __PUNCT__
yet there is still about __NUM__ ton of highli enrich uranium __PUNCT__ some of it poorli secur __PUNCT__ at civilian nuclear facil in over forti countri __PUNCT__
there ar still about __NUM__ to __NUM__ nuclear weapon and stockpil of uranium and plutonium scatter across __NUM__ time zone in the former soviet union __PUNCT__
that is why i work in the senat with dick lugar to pass a law that would help the unit state and our alli detect and stop the smuggl of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
that is why i am introduc a bill with chuck hagel that seek to prevent nuclear terror __PUNCT__ reduc global nuclear arsen __PUNCT__ and stop the spread of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
and that is why __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will lead a global effort to secur all nuclear weapon and materi at vulner site within four year __PUNCT__
while we work to secur exist stockpil __PUNCT__ we should also negoti a verifi global ban on the product of new nuclear weapon materi __PUNCT__
and i won't hesit to us the power of american diplomaci to stop countri from obtain these weapon or sponsor terror __PUNCT__
the lesson of the bush year is that not talk doe not work __PUNCT__
go down the list of countri we ignor and see how success that strategi ha been __PUNCT__
we haven't talk to iran __PUNCT__ and thei continu to build their nuclear program __PUNCT__
we haven't talk to syria __PUNCT__ and thei continu support for terror __PUNCT__
we tri not talk to north korea __PUNCT__ and thei now have enough materi for __NUM__ to __NUM__ more nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on the diplomaci of tough talk and no action __PUNCT__
it time to turn the page on washington convent wisdom that agreement must be reach befor you meet __PUNCT__ that talk to other countri is some kind of reward __PUNCT__ and that presid can onli meet with peopl who will tell them what thei want to hear __PUNCT__
presid kennedi said it best __PUNCT__ let us never negoti out of fear __PUNCT__ but let us never fear to negoti __PUNCT__
onli by know your adversari can you defeat them or drive wedg between them __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will work with our friend and alli __PUNCT__ but i won't outsourc our diplomaci in tehran to the european __PUNCT__ or our diplomaci in pyongyang to the chines __PUNCT__
i will do the care prepar need __PUNCT__ and let these countri know where america stand __PUNCT__
thei will no longer have the excus of american intransig __PUNCT__
thei will have our term __PUNCT__ no support for terror and no nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
but america must be about more than take out terrorist and lock up weapon __PUNCT__ or els new terrorist will rise up to take the place of everi on we captur or kill __PUNCT__
that is why the third step in my strategi will be dry up the rise well of support for extrem __PUNCT__
when you travel to the world troubl spot as a unit state senat __PUNCT__ much of what you see is from a helicopt __PUNCT__
so you look out __PUNCT__ with the buzz of the rotor in your ear __PUNCT__ mayb a door gunner nearbi __PUNCT__ and you see the refuge camp in darfur __PUNCT__ the flood near djibouti __PUNCT__ the bomb out block in baghdad __PUNCT__
you see thousand of desper face __PUNCT__
al qaeda new recruit come from africa and asia __PUNCT__ the middl east and europ __PUNCT__
mani come from disaffect commun and disconnect corner of our interconnect world __PUNCT__
and it make you stop and wonder __PUNCT__ when those face look up at an american helicopt __PUNCT__ do thei feel hope __PUNCT__ or do thei feel hate __PUNCT__
we know where extremist thrive __PUNCT__
in conflict zone that ar incub of resent and anarchi __PUNCT__
in weak state that cannot control their border or territori __PUNCT__ or meet the basic need of their peopl __PUNCT__
from africa to central asia to the pacif rim __PUNCT__ nearli __NUM__ countri stand on the brink of conflict or collaps __PUNCT__
the extremist encourag the exploit of these hopeless place on their hate __PUNCT__ fill websit __PUNCT__
and we know what the extremist sai about us __PUNCT__
america is just an occupi armi in muslim land __PUNCT__ the shadow of a shroud figur stand on a box at abu ghraib __PUNCT__ the power behind the throne of a repress leader __PUNCT__
thei sai we ar at war with islam __PUNCT__
that is the whisper line of the extremist who ha noth to offer in thi battl of idea but blame __PUNCT__ blame america __PUNCT__ blame progress __PUNCT__ blame jew __PUNCT__
and often he offer someth along with the hate __PUNCT__
a sens of empower __PUNCT__
mayb an educ at a madrasa __PUNCT__ some chariti for your famili __PUNCT__ some basic servic in the neighborhood __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ a mission and a gun __PUNCT__
we know we ar not who thei sai we ar __PUNCT__
america is at war with terrorist who kill on our soil __PUNCT__
we ar not at war with islam __PUNCT__
america is a compassion nation that want a better futur for all peopl __PUNCT__
the vast major of the world __NUM__ billion muslim have no us for bin ladin or hi bankrupt idea __PUNCT__
but too often sinc 9/11 __PUNCT__ the extremist have defin us __PUNCT__ not the other wai around __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ that will chang __PUNCT__
we will author our own stori __PUNCT__
we do need to stand for democraci __PUNCT__
and i will __PUNCT__
but democraci is about more than a ballot box __PUNCT__
america must show __PUNCT__ through deed as well as word __PUNCT__ that we stand with those who seek a better life __PUNCT__
that child look up at the helicopt must see america and feel hope __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will make it a focu of my foreign polici to roll back the tide of hopeless that give rise to hate __PUNCT__
freedom must mean freedom from fear __PUNCT__ not the freedom of anarchi __PUNCT__
i will never shrug my shoulder and sai __PUNCT__ as secretari rumsfeld did __PUNCT__ freedom is untidi __PUNCT__
i will focu our support on help nation build independ judici system __PUNCT__ honest polic forc __PUNCT__ and financi system that ar transpar and account __PUNCT__
freedom must also mean freedom from want __PUNCT__ not freedom lost to an empti stomach __PUNCT__
so i will make poverti reduct a kei part of help other nation reduc anarchi __PUNCT__
i will doubl our annual invest to meet these challeng to __MONEY__ billion by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and i will support a __MONEY__ billion global educ fund to counter the radic madrasa __PUNCT__ often fund by monei from within saudi arabia __PUNCT__ that have fill young mind with messag of hate __PUNCT__
we must work for a world where everi child __PUNCT__ everywher __PUNCT__ is taught to build and not to destroi __PUNCT__
and as we lead we will ask for more from our friend in europ and asia as well __PUNCT__ more support for our diplomaci __PUNCT__ more support for multilater peacekeep __PUNCT__ and more support to rebuild societi ravag by conflict __PUNCT__
i will also launch a program of public diplomaci that is a coordin effort across my administr __PUNCT__ not a small group of polit offici at the state depart explain a misguid war __PUNCT__
we will open __PUNCT__ america hous __PUNCT__ in citi across the islam world __PUNCT__ with internet __PUNCT__ librari __PUNCT__ english lesson __PUNCT__ stori of america muslim and the strength thei add to our countri __PUNCT__ and vocat program __PUNCT__
through a new __PUNCT__ america voic corp __PUNCT__ we will recruit __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ and send out into the field talent young american who can speak with __PUNCT__ and listen to __PUNCT__ the peopl who todai hear about us onli from our enemi __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will lead thi effort __PUNCT__
in the first __NUM__ dai of my administr __PUNCT__ i will travel to a major islam forum and deliv an address to redefin our struggl __PUNCT__
i will make clear that we ar not at war with islam __PUNCT__ that we will stand with those who ar will to stand up for their futur __PUNCT__ and that we need their effort to defeat the prophet of hate and violenc __PUNCT__
i will speak directli to that child who look up at that helicopt __PUNCT__ and my messag will be clear __PUNCT__ you matter to us __PUNCT__
your futur is our futur __PUNCT__
and our moment is now __PUNCT__
thi bring me to the fourth step in my strategi __PUNCT__ i will make clear that the dai of compromis our valu ar over __PUNCT__
major gener paul eaton had a long and distinguish career serv thi countri __PUNCT__
it includ train the iraqi armi __PUNCT__
after abu ghraib __PUNCT__ hi senior iraqi advisor came into hi offic and said __PUNCT__ you have no idea how thi will plai out on the street of baghdad and the rest of the arab world __PUNCT__
how can thi be __PUNCT__ thi wa not the america he had look up to __PUNCT__
as the counter __PUNCT__ insurg manual remind us __PUNCT__ we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the peopl on our side __PUNCT__
but becaus the administr decid to take the low road __PUNCT__ our troop have more enemi __PUNCT__
becaus the administr cast asid intern norm that reflect american valu __PUNCT__ we ar less abl to promot our valu __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ america will reject tortur without except __PUNCT__
america is the countri that stood against that kind of behavior __PUNCT__ and we will do so again __PUNCT__
i also will reject a legal framework that doe not work __PUNCT__
there ha been onli on convict at guantanamo __PUNCT__
it wa for a guilti plea on materi support for terror __PUNCT__
the sentenc wa __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
there ha not been on convict of a terrorist act __PUNCT__
i have faith in america court __PUNCT__ and i have faith in our jag __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will close guantanamo __PUNCT__ reject the militari commiss act __PUNCT__ and adher to the geneva convent __PUNCT__
our constitut and our uniform code of militari justic provid a framework for deal with the terrorist __PUNCT__
thi administr also put forward a fals choic between the liberti we cherish and the secur we demand __PUNCT__
i will provid our intellig and law enforc agenc with the tool thei need to track and take out the terrorist without undermin our constitut and our freedom __PUNCT__
that mean no more illeg wire __PUNCT__ tap of american citizen __PUNCT__
no more nation secur letter to spy on citizen who ar not suspect of a crime __PUNCT__
no more track citizen who do noth more than protest a misguid war __PUNCT__
no more ignor the law when it is inconveni __PUNCT__
that is not who we ar __PUNCT__
and it is not what is necessari to defeat the terrorist __PUNCT__
the fisa court work __PUNCT__
the separ of power work __PUNCT__
our constitut work __PUNCT__
we will again set an exampl for the world that the law is not subject to the whim of stubborn ruler __PUNCT__ and that justic is not arbitrari __PUNCT__
thi administr act like violat civil liberti is the wai to enhanc our secur __PUNCT__
it is not __PUNCT__
there ar no short __PUNCT__ cut to protect america __PUNCT__ and that is why the fifth part of my strategi is do the hard and patient work to secur a more resili homeland __PUNCT__
too often thi administr approach to homeland secur ha been to scatter monei around and avoid hard choic __PUNCT__ or to scare american without tell them what to be scare of __PUNCT__ or what to do __PUNCT__
