it wonder to be here todai __PUNCT__
i feel right at home in bettendorf __PUNCT__ which is just a stone throw from my home state of illinoi __PUNCT__
but the truth is __PUNCT__ we share more than the bank of a great river __PUNCT__
if you spend time in washington __PUNCT__ you hear a lot about the divis in our countri __PUNCT__
about how we becom more separ by geographi and ideolog __PUNCT__ race and religion __PUNCT__ wealth and opportun __PUNCT__
and we had plenti of politician who try to take advantag of these divis __PUNCT__ pit american against on anoth __PUNCT__ or target differ messag to differ audienc __PUNCT__
but as i travel around iowa and the rest of the countri these last nine month __PUNCT__ i haven't been struck by our differ __PUNCT__ i been impress by the valu and hope that we share __PUNCT__
in big citi and small town __PUNCT__ among men and women __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ black __PUNCT__ white __PUNCT__ and brown __PUNCT__ american share a faith in simpl dream __PUNCT__
a job with wage that can support a famili __PUNCT__
health care that we can count on and afford __PUNCT__
a retir that is dignifi and secur __PUNCT__
educ and opportun for our kid __PUNCT__
common hope __PUNCT__
american dream __PUNCT__
these ar dream that drove my grandpar __PUNCT__
after my grandfath serv in world war ii __PUNCT__ the gi bill gave him a chanc to go to colleg __PUNCT__ and the govern gave them a chanc to bui a home __PUNCT__
thei move west __PUNCT__ work hard at differ job __PUNCT__ and were abl to provid my mother with a decent educ __PUNCT__ to help rais me __PUNCT__ and to save enough to retir __PUNCT__
these ar dream that drove my father __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__
a citi worker in chicago __PUNCT__ he wa diagnos with multipl sclerosi at the ag of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but everi dai __PUNCT__ even when he had to leav an hour earlier in the morn and reli on a walker to get him there __PUNCT__ he went to work while hi wife stai home with the kid __PUNCT__
and on that singl salari __PUNCT__ he provid for hi famili and sent my wife michel and her brother to colleg __PUNCT__
hi dream wa to see them do better __PUNCT__
and thei have __PUNCT__
these ar dream that drove my mother __PUNCT__
a singl mom __PUNCT__ even while reli on food stamp as she finish her educ __PUNCT__ she follow her passion for help other __PUNCT__ and rais my sister and me to believ that in america there ar no barrier to success __PUNCT__ no matter what color you ar __PUNCT__ no matter where you from __PUNCT__ no matter how much monei you have __PUNCT__
and these ar the dream that led me to chicago over two decad ago to becom a commun organ __PUNCT__
the salari __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ wasn't what my friend would make in the corpor world or at law firm __PUNCT__
i didn't know a singl person in chicago __PUNCT__
but i knew there were folk who need help __PUNCT__
the steel plant had close __PUNCT__
job were disappear __PUNCT__
in a forgotten corner of america __PUNCT__ the american dream wa slip awai __PUNCT__
and i knew dream ar worth fight for __PUNCT__
what is uniqu about america is that we want these dream for more than ourselv __PUNCT__ we want them for each other __PUNCT__
that why we call it the american dream __PUNCT__
we want it for the kid who doesn't go to colleg becaus she cannot afford it __PUNCT__ for the worker whose wonder if hi wage will pai thi winter heat bill __PUNCT__ for __NUM__ million american live without health care __PUNCT__ for the million more who worri if thei have enough to retir with the digniti thei have earn __PUNCT__
when our fellow american ar deni the american dream __PUNCT__ our own dream ar diminish __PUNCT__
and todai __PUNCT__ the cost of that dream is rise faster than ever befor __PUNCT__
while some have prosper beyond imagin in thi global economi __PUNCT__ middl __PUNCT__ class american __PUNCT__ as well as those work hard to becom middl class __PUNCT__ ar see the american dream slip further and further awai __PUNCT__
you know it from your own live __PUNCT__
american ar work harder for less and pai more for health care and colleg __PUNCT__
for most folk __PUNCT__ on incom isn't enough to rais a famili and send your kid to colleg __PUNCT__
sometim __PUNCT__ two incom aren't enough __PUNCT__
it harder to save __PUNCT__
it harder to retir __PUNCT__
you do your part __PUNCT__ you meet your respons __PUNCT__ but it alwai seem like you tread water or fall behind __PUNCT__
and as i see thi everi dai on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ i remind of how unlik it is that the dream of my famili could be realiz todai
i don't accept thi futur __PUNCT__
we need to reclaim the american dream __PUNCT__
and that start with reclaim the white hous from georg bush and dick chenei __PUNCT__
we tire of tax cut for the wealthi that shift the burden onto the back of work peopl __PUNCT__
we tire of wait ten year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pai is soar __PUNCT__
we tire of more american go without health care __PUNCT__ of more american fall into poverti __PUNCT__ of more american kid who have the brain and the drive to go to colleg __PUNCT__ but can't __PUNCT__ becaus thei can't afford it __PUNCT__
we readi for the bush administr to end __PUNCT__ becaus we ar sick and tire of be sick and tire __PUNCT__
but thi is about more than georg bush __PUNCT__
he just the begin of the chang that we need __PUNCT__
these problem didn't start when he came to offic and thei won't end just becaus he leav __PUNCT__
we not go to reclaim that dream unless we put an end to the polit of polar and divis that is hold thi countri back __PUNCT__ unless we stand up to the corpor lobbyist that have stood in the wai of progress __PUNCT__ unless we have leadership that doesn't just tell peopl what thei want to hear __PUNCT__ but tell everyon what thei need to know __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
i believ that american want to come togeth again behind a common purpos __PUNCT__
american want to reclaim our american dream __PUNCT__
that why i run for presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
it the same reason i pack up my car and move to chicago __PUNCT__
becaus in thi countri __PUNCT__ that dream is worth fight for __PUNCT__ not just for ourselv __PUNCT__ but for each other __PUNCT__
and that why i don't think you should settl for a presid who onli there for you when it easi or conveni or popular __PUNCT__ i think you deserv a presid who you can trust will fight for your dream everi hour of everi dai for the next four year __PUNCT__
that the chang we need __PUNCT__
thi start with an economi that work for work peopl __PUNCT__
american don't expect govern to solv all our problem __PUNCT__
but you tire of a govern that work for special interest __PUNCT__ and not for you __PUNCT__
it time that we had leadership that worri as much about main street as it doe about wall street __PUNCT__
that why i introduc an american dream agenda __PUNCT__ to put some wind at the back of work peopl __PUNCT__ to lower the cost of get ahead __PUNCT__ and to protect and extend opportun for the middl class __PUNCT__
we need to give work famili a break __PUNCT__
for twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__ we seen gap in wealth grow larger __PUNCT__ while our tax code that favor wealth over work __PUNCT__
that why i propos an incom tax cut to offset the payrol tax that work american ar alreadi pai __PUNCT__
thi will be worth up to __MONEY__ for a work famili __PUNCT__
i make retir more secur for america senior by elimin incom tax for ani retire make less than __MONEY__ per year __PUNCT__
and i won't wait ten year to rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__ i guarante that it goe up everi singl year __PUNCT__
that the chang that work american need __PUNCT__
we know that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expens of the american famili __PUNCT__
you work longer hour __PUNCT__
more famili have two parent work __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ it hard to get a hand __PUNCT__
it even harder to get a break __PUNCT__
that why i doubl spend on qualiti after __PUNCT__ school program __PUNCT__ so that you can know your kid ar safe and secur __PUNCT__
and that why i expand the famili medic leav act to includ more busi and million more worker __PUNCT__ to let parent particip in school activ with their kid __PUNCT__ and to cover elderli care __PUNCT__
and we final put feder support behind state effort to provid paid famili and medic leav __PUNCT__
we also need to chang a system that is stack against women __PUNCT__
forti percent of work women do not have a singl paid sick dai __PUNCT__
more and more women ar deni job or promot becaus thei got kid at home __PUNCT__
as the son of a singl mother __PUNCT__ that is not the america that i believ in __PUNCT__
i be a presid who stand up for work parent __PUNCT__
we requir employ to provid seven paid sick dai each year __PUNCT__
we enforc law that prohibit caregiv discrimin __PUNCT__
and we encourag flexibl work schedul to better balanc work and parent for mother and father __PUNCT__
that the chang that work famili need __PUNCT__
we also need a hous market that is honest __PUNCT__ open and account __PUNCT__
i introduc a bill in the senat that crack down on mortgag fraud __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i get tough on enforc and rais penalti on lender who have broken the rule __PUNCT__
for homeown face foreclosur through no fault of their own __PUNCT__ we creat a fund and reform bankruptci law to give them a shot at avoid foreclosur __PUNCT__
we mandat that prospect homebuy have access to accur and complet inform about their mortgag option __PUNCT__
and we give middl class homeown ad relief by provid a tax credit that cover __NUM__ percent of a famili mortgag interest payment each year __PUNCT__
that the chang that america homeown need __PUNCT__
sinc mani peopl who hold subprim mortgag ar shift their debt to credit card __PUNCT__ we have to make sure that thei understand their commit __PUNCT__ otherwis credit card could be the next stage in the subprim crisi __PUNCT__
to make sure that american know what thei sign up for __PUNCT__ i institut a five __PUNCT__ star rate system to inform consum about the level of risk involv in everi credit card __PUNCT__
and we establish a credit card bill of right that will ban unilater chang to a credit card agreement __PUNCT__ ban rate chang to debt that alreadi incur __PUNCT__ and ban interest on late fee __PUNCT__
american need to pai what thei ow __PUNCT__ but thei should pai what fair __PUNCT__
thi same principl of fair is need in our bankruptci law __PUNCT__
for far too long __PUNCT__ the same politician in washington who have been cut back the safeti net for work peopl have been protect golden parachut for the well __PUNCT__ off __PUNCT__ so worker lose their pension and their health care __PUNCT__ while ceo get multi __PUNCT__ million dollar payoff __PUNCT__
i fought against a bankruptci reform bill in the senat that did more to protect credit card compani and bank than to help work peopl __PUNCT__
i continu the fight for good bankruptci law as presid __PUNCT__
no more bonus for execut while pension disappear __PUNCT__
we press firm to put more monei into their pension fund __PUNCT__ and requir firm to disclos their pension fund invest __PUNCT__
and we increas the amount of wage and benefit that worker can claim in bankruptci court __PUNCT__
that the chang we need in our bankruptci law __PUNCT__
and if you can demonstr that you went bankrupt becaus of medic expens __PUNCT__ then there must be a process that reliev that debt and let you get back on your feet __PUNCT__
i don't accept an america where we let someon go over a cliff just becaus thei get sick __PUNCT__
that is not who we ar __PUNCT__
everi four year politician come befor you to talk about health care __PUNCT__
you hear the same promis __PUNCT__
and then you see the same result __PUNCT__
well it time to end the outrag of __NUM__ million uninsur american __PUNCT__
it time to final do someth about it __PUNCT__
i reform health care in illinoi __PUNCT__ and i didn't do it alon __PUNCT__ i did it by reach out to democrat and republican __PUNCT__
we took on the insur industri __PUNCT__ and we won __PUNCT__
that how i pass a univers health care bill that cut a typic famili premium by up to __MONEY__
and mark my word __PUNCT__ i will sign thi bill by the end of my first term as presid __PUNCT__
that the chang that america is wait for __PUNCT__
and health care isn't the onli cost that we not keep up with __PUNCT__
american who work hard their entir live have earn a secur retir __PUNCT__
but right now __PUNCT__ we got __NUM__ million work peopl in thi countri who don't have employ __PUNCT__ base retir plan __PUNCT__
person save is at an all __PUNCT__ time low __PUNCT__
a part of the american dream is at risk __PUNCT__
that why i establish an automat workplac pension polici __PUNCT__
employ will be requir to enrol worker in a direct deposit retir account that place a small percentag of each paycheck into the account __PUNCT__
then you have the choic of opt out __PUNCT__ match __PUNCT__ or ad to thi account __PUNCT__
when you chang job __PUNCT__ your save will roll over into your new employ system __PUNCT__ or into a system that you control if you leav the workplac or becom self __PUNCT__ emploi __PUNCT__
and the feder govern will match save for work famili __PUNCT__
thi will dramat increas the number of american who save for retir __PUNCT__ and lift up the amount of save in thi countri __PUNCT__
that the chang we need to help american achiev the retir thei ar work for __PUNCT__
but we need to do more than put the american dream on a firmer foundat __PUNCT__
everi american ha the right to pursu their dream __PUNCT__
but we also have the respons to make sure that our children can reach a littl further and rise a littl higher than we did __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will stop pass bill call no child left behind that leav the monei behind __PUNCT__ and start make real invest in educ __PUNCT__
that mean earli childhood educ __PUNCT__
that mean recruit an armi of new teacher __PUNCT__ and pai them better __PUNCT__ and support them more so thei not just teach to test __PUNCT__ but teach to teach __PUNCT__
it also mean put a colleg educ within reach of everi american __PUNCT__
that the best invest we can make in our futur __PUNCT__
i creat a new and fulli refund tax credit worth __MONEY__ for tuition and fee everi year __PUNCT__ which will cover two __PUNCT__ third of the tuition at the averag public colleg or univers __PUNCT__
i also simplifi the financi aid applic process so that we don't have a million student who aren't appli for aid becaus it too difficult __PUNCT__
i will start by elimin the current student aid form altogeth __PUNCT__ we us tax data instead __PUNCT__
and i tap the tremend resourc of commun colleg __PUNCT__ which educ half the undergradu in thi countri __PUNCT__ by creat a new commun colleg partnership program __PUNCT__
we help school determin what skill and technic educ ar need to help local industri __PUNCT__ we expand new degre for emerg field __PUNCT__ and we reward school that graduat more student __PUNCT__
that the chang we need so that our young peopl can achiev their dream __PUNCT__
thi is what we must do to reclaim the american dream __PUNCT__
we know it won't be easi __PUNCT__
we hear from the can't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ won't __PUNCT__ even __PUNCT__ try crowd in washington __PUNCT__ the special interest and their lobbyist __PUNCT__ the convent think that sai thi countri is just too divid to make progress __PUNCT__
well i not run for presid to conform to thi convent think __PUNCT__ i run to challeng it __PUNCT__
there is too much at stake __PUNCT__
too much at stake for the famili that can't get ahead __PUNCT__ the elderli worker who face a retir fill with worri __PUNCT__ the kid who doesn't believ america ha a place for her dream __PUNCT__
to stand up for these american __PUNCT__ i don't want to settl for anyth less than real chang __PUNCT__ fundament chang __PUNCT__ chang we need __PUNCT__ chang that we can believ in __PUNCT__
it chang that i been fight for sinc i move out to chicago over two decad ago __PUNCT__
becaus those dream __PUNCT__ american dream __PUNCT__ ar worth fight for __PUNCT__
and becaus i wouldn't be stand on thi stage todai if it weren't for the dream of those who came befor me __PUNCT__
the dream of my grandfath __PUNCT__ who march in patton armi and move hi famili west in search of opportun __PUNCT__
the dream of my grandmoth __PUNCT__ who wa up at dawn and work twice as hard at her job becaus a woman had to work harder to get ahead __PUNCT__
the dream of my father who cross an ocean becaus america offer that light to the world __PUNCT__
the dream of my mother __PUNCT__ a singl mom who understood that a life rich in famili and experi wa more import than a life of rich __PUNCT__
the dream of those men and women on the south side of chicago __PUNCT__ who fought with me to creat a futur for their commun after the steel plant wa shutter __PUNCT__
there ha been a lot of talk in thi campaign about the polit of hope __PUNCT__
but the polit of hope doesn't mean hope that thing come easi __PUNCT__
it a polit of believ in thing unseen __PUNCT__ of believ in what thi countri might be __PUNCT__ and of stand up for that belief and fight for it when it hard __PUNCT__
america is the sum of our dream __PUNCT__
and what bind us togeth __PUNCT__ what make us on american famili __PUNCT__ is that we stand up and fight for each other dream __PUNCT__ that we reaffirm that fundament belief __PUNCT__ i am my brother keeper __PUNCT__ i am my sister keeper __PUNCT__ through our polit __PUNCT__ our polici __PUNCT__ and in our daili live __PUNCT__
it time to do that onc more __PUNCT__
