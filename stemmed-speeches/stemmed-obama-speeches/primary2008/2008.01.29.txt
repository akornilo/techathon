we have been made to believ that differ of race and region __PUNCT__ wealth and gender __PUNCT__ parti and religion have separ us into war faction __PUNCT__ into red state and blue state made up of individu with oppos want and need __PUNCT__ with conflict hope and dream __PUNCT__
it is a vision of america that been exploit and encourag by pundit and politician who need thi divis to score point and win elect __PUNCT__
but it is a vision of america that i am run for presid to fundament reject __PUNCT__ not becaus of a blind optim i hold __PUNCT__ but becaus of a stori i live __PUNCT__
it a stori that began here __PUNCT__ in el dorado __PUNCT__ when a young man fell in love with a young woman who grew up down the road in augusta __PUNCT__
thei came of ag in the midst of the depress __PUNCT__ where he found odd job on small farm and oil rig __PUNCT__ alwai dodg the bank failur and foreclosur that were sweep the nation __PUNCT__
thei marri just after war broke out in europ __PUNCT__ and he enlist in patton armi after the bomb of pearl harbor __PUNCT__
she gave birth to their daughter on the base at fort leavenworth __PUNCT__ and work on a bomber assembl line when he left for war __PUNCT__
in a time of great uncertainti and anxieti __PUNCT__ my grandpar held on to a simpl dream __PUNCT__ that thei could rais my mother in a land of boundless opportun __PUNCT__ that their gener struggl and sacrific could give her the freedom to be what she want to be __PUNCT__ to live how she want to live __PUNCT__
i am stand here todai becaus that dream wa realiz __PUNCT__ becaus my grandfath got the chanc to go to school on the gi bill __PUNCT__ bui a hous through the feder hous author __PUNCT__ and move hi famili west __PUNCT__ all the wai to hawaii __PUNCT__ where my mother would go to colleg and on dai fall in love with a young student from kenya __PUNCT__
i am here becaus that dream made my parent __PUNCT__ love possibl __PUNCT__ even then __PUNCT__ becaus it meant that after my father left __PUNCT__ when my mother struggl as a singl parent __PUNCT__ and even turn to food stamp for a time __PUNCT__ she wa still abl to send my sister and me to the best school in the countri __PUNCT__
and i here becaus year later __PUNCT__ when i found my own love in a place far awai call chicago __PUNCT__ she told me of a similar dream __PUNCT__
michel grew up in a work __PUNCT__ class famili on the south side dure the 1960 __PUNCT__
her father had been diagnos with multipl sclerosi at just thirti year old __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ everi dai of hi life __PUNCT__ even when he had to reli on a walker to get him there __PUNCT__ fraser robinson went to work at the local water filtrat plant while hi wife stai home with the children __PUNCT__
and on that singl salari __PUNCT__ he wa abl to send michel and her brother to princeton __PUNCT__
our famili stori is on that span mile and gener __PUNCT__ race and realiti __PUNCT__
it the stori of farmer and soldier __PUNCT__ citi worker and singl mom __PUNCT__
it take place in small town and good school __PUNCT__ in kansa and kenya __PUNCT__ on the shore of hawaii and the street of chicago __PUNCT__
it a vari and unlik journei __PUNCT__ but on that held togeth by the same simpl dream __PUNCT__
and that is why it american __PUNCT__
that why i can stand here and talk about how thi countri is more than a collect of red state and blue state __PUNCT__ becaus my stori could onli happen in the unit state __PUNCT__
that why i believ that we ar not as divid as our polit suggest __PUNCT__ that the dream we share is more power than the differ we have __PUNCT__ becaus i am live proof of that ideal __PUNCT__
and that is what i have seen all across thi countri over the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__
i seen crumbl school in south carolina that ar steal the futur of black children and white children __PUNCT__
i been told of the injustic in the grow divid between main street and wall street by the lowest __PUNCT__ paid worker and the wealthiest billionair __PUNCT__
i met autowork in iowa and teacher in new hampshir and dishwash in nevada who ar all fight the same fight for better wage and good benefit and a retir thei can count on __PUNCT__
and i talk to young peopl and old peopl __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ independ __PUNCT__ and republican who love their countri __PUNCT__ support their troop __PUNCT__ and believ it is time to bring them home from iraq __PUNCT__
we ar not as divid as our polit suggest __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we disagre __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we have interest and ideolog that don't alwai align __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we have real differ __PUNCT__
but the biggest divid in america todai is not between it peopl __PUNCT__ it is between it peopl and their leader in washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
that is where our collect dream ha been defer __PUNCT__
that where the monei and influenc of lobbyist kill our plan to make health care more afford or energi cleaner year after year after year __PUNCT__
that where campaign promis to keep job in america or put tax cut in the pocket of work famili ar cast asid to make room for the polit of the moment __PUNCT__
and that where politician would rather demon each other to score point than come togeth to solv our common challeng __PUNCT__
that is where the real divis li __PUNCT__ in a polit that echo through the media and seep into our cultur __PUNCT__ the kind that seek to drive us apart and put up wall where none exist __PUNCT__
it the polit that tell us that those who differ from us on a few thing ar differ from us on all thing __PUNCT__ that our problem ar the fault of those who don't think like us or look like us or come from where we do __PUNCT__
the welfar queen is take our tax monei __PUNCT__
the immigr is take our job __PUNCT__
the gai person must be immor __PUNCT__ and the believ must be intoler __PUNCT__
well we ar here to sai that thi is not the america we believ in and thi is not the polit we have to accept anymor __PUNCT__
not thi time __PUNCT__
not now __PUNCT__
thi will not be easi __PUNCT__
becaus the chang we seek will not just come from overcom the ingrain and destruct habit of washington __PUNCT__ it will requir overcom our own fear and our own doubt __PUNCT__
it will requir each of us to do our part in close the moral deficit __PUNCT__ the empathi deficit __PUNCT__ that exist in thi nation __PUNCT__
it will take stand in on anoth shoe and rememb that we ar our brother keeper __PUNCT__ we ar our sister keeper __PUNCT__
thi will not be easi __PUNCT__ but america stori tell me it possibl __PUNCT__
my stori tell me it possibl __PUNCT__
what began here in kansa all those year ago tell me it possibl __PUNCT__
becaus as we face anoth time of anxieti and uncertainti __PUNCT__ a time where foreclosur sweep the nation and famili struggl to stai afloat __PUNCT__ where love on leav for war and parent wonder what kind of world their children will inherit __PUNCT__ i believ that thi nation can ralli around the simpl dream that my grandpar held on to even in the darkest of dai __PUNCT__
it a dream that we can find a job with wage that support a famili __PUNCT__
that we can have health care that afford for when we get sick __PUNCT__
that we can retir with digniti and secur __PUNCT__
and that we can provid our children with educ and opportun __PUNCT__ so that thei can be what thei want to be and live how thei want to live __PUNCT__
thei ar the common dream that can final unit a nation around a common purpos __PUNCT__
there ar those who will continu to tell us we cannot do thi __PUNCT__
that we cannot come togeth __PUNCT__
that the divis in our polit run too deep __PUNCT__
that we ar offer the american peopl fals hope __PUNCT__
but here what i know __PUNCT__
i know that when i hear peopl sai that we can't come togeth to lift up work famili who ar struggl in thi economi __PUNCT__ i think back to the street of chicago __PUNCT__ where i began my career as a commun organ twenti __PUNCT__ five year ago __PUNCT__
in the shadow of a close steel mill __PUNCT__ we brought white peopl and black peopl and latino togeth to provid job train to the jobless and after school program for children __PUNCT__
block by block __PUNCT__ we restor hope and opportun to those neighborhood __PUNCT__ and i can believ we can do the same thing for the work famili of america __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ there an econom stimulu packag move through congress that will provid a boost to the economi and to work famili __PUNCT__
it similar to the on i propos a few week ago __PUNCT__ and would provid immedi tax relief for work famili __PUNCT__
i hope that when it final __PUNCT__ it will also provid relief to senior and extend unemploy insur to those who lost their job __PUNCT__
but we need to do even more to restor fair and balanc to our economi __PUNCT__
last night __PUNCT__ we heard the presid sai that he want to make hi tax cut for the wealthiest american perman __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__
well we can't afford more georg bush tax cut for those who don't need them and weren't even ask for them __PUNCT__
it time to give tax relief to the middl __PUNCT__ class famili who need it right now __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we stop give tax break to compani who ship our job oversea __PUNCT__ and i put a middl __PUNCT__ class tax cut into the pocket of work famili __PUNCT__
thi tax cut will be worth up to __MONEY__ for a work famili __PUNCT__
we provid struggl homeown some relief by give them a tax credit that would cover ten percent of a famili mortgag interest payment everi year __PUNCT__
and we also go to give senior a break by elimin incom tax for ani retire make less than __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ becaus everi singl american should be abl to retir with digniti and respect __PUNCT__
that also mean help american save for retir when thei still work __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ employ will be requir to enrol everi worker in a direct deposit retir account that place a small percentag of each paycheck into save __PUNCT__
you can keep thi account even if you chang job __PUNCT__ and the feder govern will match the save for lower __PUNCT__ incom __PUNCT__ work famili __PUNCT__
it also time we had a presid who won't wait anoth ten year to rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__
i will rais it to keep pace everi year so that worker don't fall behind __PUNCT__
i institut a credit card bill of right that will ban credit card compani from chang the agreement you sign up for __PUNCT__ chang the interest rate on debt you alreadi incur __PUNCT__ or charg interest on late fee __PUNCT__
american should pai what thei ow __PUNCT__ but thei should also pai what fair __PUNCT__ not just what profit for some credit card compani __PUNCT__
the same principl should appli to our bankruptci law __PUNCT__
i oppos the credit card industri bankruptci bill that made it harder for work famili to climb out of debt __PUNCT__ and when i presid __PUNCT__ i make sure that ceo can't dump your pension with on hand while thei collect a bonu with the other __PUNCT__
that an outrag __PUNCT__ and it time we had a presid who know it an outrag __PUNCT__
it also time we had a presid who stop talk about the outrag of __NUM__ million uninsur american and start do someth about it __PUNCT__
when i hear that we can't come togeth and expand health care to the uninsur __PUNCT__ i think back to how i wa abl to bring democrat and republican togeth in illinoi to provid health insur to __NUM__ children and parent __PUNCT__
and when i presid __PUNCT__ we final pass a univers health care plan that will make sure everi singl american can get the same kind of health care that member of congress get for themselv __PUNCT__
my plan doe more to cut cost than ani other plan in thi race __PUNCT__ up to __MONEY__ for a typic famili __PUNCT__
and we won't pass it twenti year from now __PUNCT__ not ten year from now __PUNCT__ we pass health care by the end of my first term in offic __PUNCT__
when i hear that there no wai we can overcom the power of lobbyist and special interest __PUNCT__ i think about how i wa abl to pass the first major ethic reform in illinoi twenti __PUNCT__ five year __PUNCT__
i think about how in washington __PUNCT__ i wa abl to bring democrat and republican togeth to pass the strongest lobbi reform in a gener __PUNCT__ we ban gift from lobbyist __PUNCT__ meal with lobbyist __PUNCT__ subsid travel on fanci jet __PUNCT__ and for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ we forc lobbyist to tell the american public who thei rais monei from and who in congress thei funnel it to __PUNCT__
washington lobbyist haven't fund my campaign __PUNCT__ thei won't run my white hous __PUNCT__ and thei will not drown out the voic of work american when i am presid __PUNCT__
and when i hear that some of our kid just can't learn __PUNCT__ that we can't do anyth about crumbl school and rise tuition __PUNCT__ i think back to the chanc that somebodi __PUNCT__ somewher gave my famili __PUNCT__
the ticket my father got to come studi in america __PUNCT__
the opportun my mother had to put herself through graduat school __PUNCT__
the chanc i had to go to the best school in the countri __PUNCT__ even though we didn't have much __PUNCT__
it is time to give everi child in america that kind of chanc __PUNCT__ no matter what thei look like or where thei come from __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will provid all our children with a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__ from the dai thei born until the dai thei graduat colleg __PUNCT__
that mean earli childhood educ to give them the best possibl start __PUNCT__
that mean not just talk about how great teacher ar __PUNCT__ but reward them for their great __PUNCT__ with better pai __PUNCT__ and more support __PUNCT__
and it mean provid everi american with a __MONEY__ a year tax credit that will final help make a colleg educ afford and avail for all __PUNCT__
thi elect is our chanc __PUNCT__ our moment __PUNCT__ to restor the simpl dream of those who came befor us for anoth gener of american __PUNCT__
but onli if we can come togeth and like previou gener did and close that divid between a peopl and it leader in washington __PUNCT__
becaus in the end __PUNCT__ the choic in thi elect is not between region or religion or gender __PUNCT__
it not about rich versu poor __PUNCT__ young versu old __PUNCT__ and it is not about black versu white __PUNCT__
it about the past versu the futur __PUNCT__
it about whether we settl for the same divis and distract and drama that pass for polit todai __PUNCT__ or whether we reach for a polit of common sens and innov __PUNCT__ of share sacrific and share prosper __PUNCT__
in the face of war and depress __PUNCT__ through great struggl and tremend sacrific __PUNCT__ that is the futur that my grandpar __PUNCT__ gener forg for their children __PUNCT__
it is why that littl girl who wa born at fort leavenworth could dream as big as the kansa sky __PUNCT__
and it is why i stand befor you todai __PUNCT__ becaus there ar two littl girl i tuck in at night who deserv a world in which thei can dream those same big dream __PUNCT__ in which thei can have the same chanc as ani other child live ani other place __PUNCT__
it is a dream i share for your children and all of our children __PUNCT__ and that is why it american __PUNCT__ alwai hope __PUNCT__ alwai reach __PUNCT__ alwai strive for that better dai ahead __PUNCT__
i hope you join me on that journei __PUNCT__ and i thank you for welcom me back to the place my famili call home __PUNCT__
