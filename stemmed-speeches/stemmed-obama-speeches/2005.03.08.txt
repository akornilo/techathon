thank you rick __PUNCT__
we here todai becaus when it come to the global economi __PUNCT__ the rule of the game have chang __PUNCT__
thi is a fact not onli understood by a room of silicon vallei ceo __PUNCT__ but by famili i met all across illinoi dure the campaign __PUNCT__
thei know that when it come to their job and their wage __PUNCT__ thei not onli compet with worker in napervil and carbondal __PUNCT__ but in new delhi and calcutta __PUNCT__
what more __PUNCT__ thei know that when it come to the high __PUNCT__ tech __PUNCT__ high skill job of the futur __PUNCT__ their children ar not onli compet with children here in the unit state __PUNCT__ but with those on the other side of the globe who ar increasingli be educ earlier __PUNCT__ longer __PUNCT__ and with a special emphasi on the math and scienc skill requir for the industri of tomorrow __PUNCT__
these famili tell me that thei anxiou about their futur __PUNCT__
thei worri that thei could becom the first gener of american to see their children do wors than thei did __PUNCT__
thei rememb that when we were all grow up __PUNCT__ our parent knew that if thei push us to studi and work hard __PUNCT__ the best univers would be open to us and we could get ani job we want __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ parent in citi and town all over america ar lose that hope __PUNCT__ thei lose the sens that their kid will be abl to dream the american dream __PUNCT__
the rule of the game have chang __PUNCT__
and so we must chang with them __PUNCT__
but in a countri of innov and optimist __PUNCT__ a countri that pioneer the first moon land __PUNCT__ discov the cure for polio __PUNCT__ and led the technolog revolut of the nineti __PUNCT__ i have no doubt that we can __PUNCT__
thi is the great project for our time __PUNCT__ and so it must becom a larger part of the debat in our polit __PUNCT__ our busi __PUNCT__ our school and our home __PUNCT__
the good new is that we have the resourc __PUNCT__ we have the brainpow __PUNCT__ and we ar still an econom and technolog giant __PUNCT__
in illinoi alon we have __NUM__ high __PUNCT__ tech worker __PUNCT__
the univers of illinoi at champagn __PUNCT__ urbana is where marc andreesen develop mosaic __PUNCT__ the browser that made the world wide web what it is todai __PUNCT__
and right now at argonn nation laboratori __PUNCT__ scientist ar develop the technolog for __PUNCT__ grid comput __PUNCT__ which ibm and other believ repres the futur of the it industri __PUNCT__
all across america __PUNCT__ world __PUNCT__ class univers __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ rate research facil and brilliant mind ar on the cusp of discov the next big idea that will lift up the qualiti of our live __PUNCT__ creat million of new job __PUNCT__ and chang our world __PUNCT__
we can take comfort in know that __PUNCT__ but we can't take it for grant __PUNCT__ becaus right now other countri ar look at place like silicon vallei and north carolina research triangl and sai __PUNCT__ we want that __PUNCT__
thei invest in better univers __PUNCT__ expand research budget and ventur capit __PUNCT__ produc more scienc and engin graduat __PUNCT__ and pass innov __PUNCT__ friendli public polici __PUNCT__
none of us expect or want the govern to lead the next technolog revolut __PUNCT__ but i believ that we can provid the spark that fuel america innov and competit in the global economi __PUNCT__
i believ we can do better than cut the budget for the nation scienc foundat __PUNCT__ as thi year budget ha done for the first time __PUNCT__
we can do better than fall to __NUM__ place in the world when it come to provid peopl with access to broadband __PUNCT__
we can do better when it come to us technolog to free ourselv from america danger depend on mideast oil __PUNCT__
we can do better than burden busi with case of class action abus __PUNCT__ and that why i cast a tough vote in favor of reform the other week __PUNCT__
and we can do better __PUNCT__ think bigger __PUNCT__ and act bolder when it come to educ in thi countri __PUNCT__
the best part about bill gate __PUNCT__ speech last week wa when he said that our school ar in danger of becom obsolet as tool to educ tomorrow worker for tomorrow job __PUNCT__
but school ar where our children dream begin __PUNCT__ and so school ar where we must begin to make those dream come true __PUNCT__
we shouldn't wait until high school either __PUNCT__
we have to start the wai jim barksdal of netscap did when he gave a big grant and a lot of hope to preschool in mississippi __PUNCT__
we can't leav kid behind befor thei even enter the first grade __PUNCT__ and that why i continu to focu on earli childhood educ as a wai to give them the best start in life __PUNCT__
we also know that some of the best idea in educ don't come from washington __PUNCT__ but from local school all over america __PUNCT__
that why charter school ar a great wai for us to learn from experi in topeka and springfield that school in chicago and l.a __PUNCT__ can replic in their own classroom __PUNCT__
and becaus the success of your busi depend on your abil to fill job with great mind __PUNCT__ we need more corpor and privat invest in our school __PUNCT__
john doer work with the new school ventur fund is lead the wai on thi front __PUNCT__ and we should all commend him for that __PUNCT__
as parent and citizen __PUNCT__ each of us ha a stake in make sure that our school ar do everyth possibl to give our kid the competit edg thei need in a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__
the test we have now ar great wai to gather inform about what work and what doesn't __PUNCT__ but thei not enough __PUNCT__
i believ that to meet tomorrow challeng __PUNCT__ we should creat a nation network of academi to train __NUM__ new teacher and get them into high __PUNCT__ need rural and urban school __PUNCT__
we should give local school the latest technolog train tool as john chamber ha done with the cisco network academi program __PUNCT__
when i wa at the univers of chicago __PUNCT__ other faculti member and myself develop a program where we essenti adopt primari school to help them learn how to us the technolog opportun thei were be offer __PUNCT__
it not enough just to set down a comput in a classroom and walk awai __PUNCT__ we must also train teacher and administr on how to us that comput and it technolog to find new and better wai of educ our children __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we should work to close the gap that is widen between america and the rest of the world when it come to math and scienc graduat __PUNCT__
to do thi __PUNCT__ we must start by inspir our children with a sens of __URL__ nurtur their imagin so that thei mai dream big and then work hard to reach those dream __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ our children spend hour plai playstat without ever find out how to build playstat __PUNCT__
thei watch televis but never wonder how it put togeth __PUNCT__
thei surf web page after web page on the internet __PUNCT__ but ar never taught how to design on __PUNCT__
the incred stori of progress that is america ha alwai been built by those who ask why __PUNCT__ what if __PUNCT__ and why not __PUNCT__
our school must begin instil that wonder in our children again so that their gener will unit around the next great project of our time __PUNCT__ whether it be declar america energi independ or launch the next great technolog revolut __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ the debat about educ here in washington degener to old argument and stale idea __PUNCT__
and so it time to put asid partisan differ and just talk about what work for our kid and what will keep america competit in thi new centuri __PUNCT__
those ar goal we all have and hope we all share __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ the rule of the game have chang __PUNCT__
and now it time for us to prove to the world that we can still plai better than anyon __PUNCT__
the famili i met ar readi to try __PUNCT__
their kid ar readi __PUNCT__
technet is readi __PUNCT__
and in the come month __PUNCT__ i will do my best to work with my colleagu and make sure our govern is readi too __PUNCT__
i want to thank technet for do your part to get thi dialogu go __PUNCT__ and now i like to take a few question from the audienc __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
