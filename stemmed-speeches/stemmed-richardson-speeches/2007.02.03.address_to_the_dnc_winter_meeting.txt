now __PUNCT__ you in your second dai of hear polit speech and you heard from some of our best __PUNCT__
you know our countri would be a lot better off with ani of them serv in the white hous __PUNCT__ as my vice presid __PUNCT__
but the truth __PUNCT__ is we will onli win the white hous if we __PUNCT__ as fellow democrat __PUNCT__ who share fundament core belief __PUNCT__ don't tear each other down __PUNCT__
and we a parti built on a platform of idea and ideal __PUNCT__
we share a fundament belief in the notion that equal is not achiev by knock someon els out of the wai and kick them when thei down __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we believ in offer them a hand and lift them up __PUNCT__
it is why __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ it is why todai i am call on other democrat candid to agre to run onli posit campaign in thi democrat nomin process __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ further __PUNCT__ i call on the democrat nation committe to pass a resolut demand that all the candid run clean campaign and not attack each other __PUNCT__

but __PUNCT__ the truth is __PUNCT__ most of america doesn't want to hear anoth polit speech right now and __PUNCT__ honestli __PUNCT__ i don't blame them __PUNCT__
thei see enough polit in the nightli new __PUNCT__ in the grim statist of a war gone horribl wrong __PUNCT__ a war that is mostli about polit and postur and save face __PUNCT__
and that the worst sort of polit imagin __PUNCT__
our challeng __PUNCT__ as democrat __PUNCT__ is not to just break through the voter __PUNCT__ cynic __PUNCT__ but also to convinc them that we up to the job that thei entrust us with __PUNCT__
we won the congress __PUNCT__ but we still have a lot to prove __PUNCT__
we need a democrat nomine who abl to stand up for our principl __PUNCT__ our valu __PUNCT__ make the case to the american peopl __PUNCT__ show them we can get thing done __PUNCT__ and creat a last democrat major __PUNCT__
but i tire of hear the democrat don't stand for anyth __PUNCT__

and when it came up to stand for the right of work peopl __PUNCT__ we didn't compromis our ideal __PUNCT__
we act on them __PUNCT__
and to creat all those job __PUNCT__ we first pass a specif tax credit for creat good pai job __PUNCT__
you pai over the prevail wage __PUNCT__ compani __PUNCT__ you get a tax credit __PUNCT__
we made the rural tax credit perman __PUNCT__
we enact a three __PUNCT__ year tax holidai for high tech startup and we invest state monei in local compani that show great promis for success and job creation __PUNCT__
rather than us tax cut to reward the wealthi __PUNCT__ i us them to reward put peopl to work __PUNCT__
we balanc the budget __PUNCT__
but we also increas school fund by __MONEY__ million and we made sure it all went into the classroom and not the bureaucraci __PUNCT__

we invest directli in energi effici and no other state ha done as much to promot renew energi with tax credit for wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ bio fuel __PUNCT__
we elimin tax on hybrid car and we requir util compani to start produc energi from renew sourc __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent next year __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent in five year __PUNCT__ five year later __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
