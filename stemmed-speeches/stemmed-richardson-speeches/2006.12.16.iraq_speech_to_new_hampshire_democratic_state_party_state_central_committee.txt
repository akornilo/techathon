thank you kathi __PUNCT__
you ar a great state chair __PUNCT__
i like to thank the state committe for host me __PUNCT__
i hope you all take great pride in your work in thi last elect __PUNCT__
the democrat tidal wave that rush across america last month start right here in new hampshir __PUNCT__
the peopl in thi room made nh histori __PUNCT__ and help chang american histori __PUNCT__
as chair of the democrat governor associ __PUNCT__ i wa glad to plai a small part in that histori __PUNCT__
thank to the hard work of peopl like you __PUNCT__ democrat have becom the major parti __PUNCT__
as you mai have heard __PUNCT__ i met with north korean diplomat yesterdai on their wai to the six __PUNCT__ parti talk __PUNCT__ and i be happi to take your question __PUNCT__
but thi morn __PUNCT__ i would like to talk to you about anoth issu __PUNCT__
a quagmir which we democrat did not creat __PUNCT__ but which we now must help resolv __PUNCT__
like all of you __PUNCT__ i am sure __PUNCT__ i have struggl for a long time over iraq __PUNCT__
like most american __PUNCT__ i am sadden by the horrif violenc that take dozen __PUNCT__ score of innoc live everi dai __PUNCT__
and like most american __PUNCT__ i believ that our countri ha a moral oblig to do what we can to help the iraqi end that violenc __PUNCT__
and becaus of that belief __PUNCT__ it ha not been easi for me to come to thi conclus __PUNCT__ that the best thing we can do __PUNCT__ for them as well as for ourselv __PUNCT__ is to leav __PUNCT__
carefulli and strateg __PUNCT__
but we must leav __PUNCT__
and soon __PUNCT__
becaus our militari ha done all it can do there __PUNCT__
our troop have done a magnific job in iraq under terribl circumst __PUNCT__
but our continu militari presenc is not help the iraqi creat a stabl order __PUNCT__
our presenc is not prevent a bloodbath __PUNCT__
that bloodbath is alreadi happen __PUNCT__
more than three thousand civilian men __PUNCT__ women and children ar dy each month __PUNCT__
eighti percent of iraqi have said thei want us to leav __PUNCT__
sixti percent sai thei think it justifi to kill american __PUNCT__
sunni and shiit alik see us as occupi __PUNCT__ and believ our presenc there is make thing wors __PUNCT__
there is no militari solut to iraq polit crisi __PUNCT__
we need to end thi fiasco now __PUNCT__ and start down the hard path back to a safer futur and a more realist foreign polici __PUNCT__
our safeti __PUNCT__ as much as the safeti of the iraqi __PUNCT__ is at stake __PUNCT__
we need to stop throw good monei after bad __PUNCT__
we need to stop send our soldier to die for a tragic mistak __PUNCT__
the messag of the mid __PUNCT__ term elect elect wa clear __PUNCT__ the american peopl have lost faith in presid bush and hi iraq polici __PUNCT__
logic __PUNCT__ we have onli three choic __PUNCT__ escal the war __PUNCT__ hunker down and stai __PUNCT__ or stand down __PUNCT__
the lead advoc for escal the war is senat john mccain __PUNCT__
i have serv with john in congress and i respect him __PUNCT__
but john mccain is wrong __PUNCT__ dead wrong to think that we can solv iraq polit crisi through militari escal __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ everi time we have sent in more troop __PUNCT__ violenc onli increas __PUNCT__
there is no militari solut to iraq polit crisi __PUNCT__
the second option is to hunker down and stai indefinit but thi will never stabil iraq __PUNCT__
we can stai and arm and train their polic and armi __PUNCT__
but deadli militia have thoroughli infiltr both the polic and the armi at all level __PUNCT__
much of the sectarian violenc is actual be commit by the veri peopl we ar train and arm __PUNCT__
onli a polit solut can stop that __PUNCT__
and onli the iraqi can do it __PUNCT__
our onli real option is to redeploi our troop __PUNCT__ and allow the iraqi to take respons for their countri __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ i been to iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
i work in thi region __PUNCT__
and i negoti with folk who ar anyth but diplomat __PUNCT__ sudanes rebel __PUNCT__ north korean gener __PUNCT__ fidel castro __PUNCT__ the taliban __PUNCT__ and saddam hussein __PUNCT__
negoti with them ha help me develop a pragmat approach to foreign polici __PUNCT__
i call it the new realism __SYMBOL__ it valu realiti over ideolog __PUNCT__ respons over rhetor __PUNCT__ and dialogu over name __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__
i believ it is more import to be tough __PUNCT__ than to talk tough __PUNCT__
iraq is in a state of civil war __PUNCT__ and onli thei can stop it __PUNCT__
we ar at the point where we now have to choos between bad option and wors on __PUNCT__
we need to choos the path that will do the least damag to american nation secur __PUNCT__
i agre with senat levin that our leverag is the withdraw of our troop __PUNCT__
onc iraq leader understand that our militari presenc in iraq is neither perman nor uncondit thei ar far more like to take the polit step necessari to deal with their polit crisi __PUNCT__
we should give the iraqi cabinet the opportun to discuss the detail of our departur with us and to make suggest __PUNCT__ but we need to establish a __NUM__ departur date __PUNCT__
if the iraqi govern agre __PUNCT__ we should announc jointli that our mission is over __PUNCT__ and that we will leav by the specifi date __PUNCT__
if thei don't agre __PUNCT__ we should announc that date without them __PUNCT__
we should harbor no illus __PUNCT__
thi withdraw will not be pretti __PUNCT__
peopl will die __PUNCT__
but fewer will die than if we stai __PUNCT__
there ar no guarante that our departur will end the civil war __PUNCT__
but it is sure to continu so long as we stai __PUNCT__
the iraqi might __PUNCT__ or might not __PUNCT__ resolv their polit crisi __PUNCT__
it is up to them __PUNCT__
thei distrust and fear on anoth __PUNCT__ and thi make it veri tough __PUNCT__
but thei share on goal __PUNCT__ thei don't want to destroi their own countri __PUNCT__
to save it __PUNCT__ thei need to stop kill each other and start compromis and we need to get out of the wai __PUNCT__
and then we have a moral oblig to help __PUNCT__
onc we ar on our wai out __PUNCT__ i believ we can be help in the follow wai __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ we should encourag nation reconcili talk __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we should work with the iraqi and the un to conven a region confer similar to the dayton confer that produc a settlement in yugoslavia __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ the unit state must lead the wai on econom assist for reconstruct __PUNCT__
work with the un __PUNCT__ the european and other countri and for our own secur __PUNCT__ we must return nation guard troop to their state __PUNCT__ where thei ar need __PUNCT__ and redeploi troop to afghanistan __PUNCT__ to knock down the resurg taliban __PUNCT__
redeploy from iraq will help us rebuild our militari __PUNCT__ so we can negoti from a posit of strength with countri like iran __PUNCT__ syria and north korea __PUNCT__
diplomaci and militari power ar not altern to on anoth __PUNCT__ but rather ar complementari sourc of strength __PUNCT__
becaus diplomaci without power is weak __PUNCT__ and power without diplomaci is blind __PUNCT__
there ar no quick or easi answer to the crisi in iraq __PUNCT__
our choic ar between bad option and wors on __PUNCT__
some prefer militari escal __PUNCT__
some choos stai the cours __PUNCT__
these option ar illus __PUNCT__
the onli realist choic we have is to stand down militarili __PUNCT__ and let the iraqi stand up and face the polit crisi which onli thei can resolv __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
