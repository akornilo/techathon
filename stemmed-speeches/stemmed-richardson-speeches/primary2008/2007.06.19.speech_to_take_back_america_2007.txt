i appreci the opportun to speak here todai __PUNCT__
i think thi confer is on of the most import event that all of us __PUNCT__ as candid __PUNCT__ will attend thi year __PUNCT__
and i like to tell you why it import to me person __PUNCT__
i first got involv in public servic after meet hubert humphrei in __NUM__ while i wa in graduat school __PUNCT__
despit hi narrow defeat in the __NUM__ presidenti elect __PUNCT__ he hadn't lost hi ideal __PUNCT__
he challeng me and the other student i wa with to try and make a differ with our live __PUNCT__ to look at the world around us and seek out the inequ that sometim plain to see __PUNCT__ and other time hidden from view __PUNCT__ and to give our best effort to heal our nation __PUNCT__
thi is a hauntingli similar time __PUNCT__
like __NUM__ we ar a nation deep into an unwant war __PUNCT__ the presid ha lost the countri __PUNCT__ there is hurt and sorrow among our peopl __PUNCT__ and there is a sens that no matter who is elect __PUNCT__ we have a long road in front of us __PUNCT__
but there is great risk in take onli thi view __PUNCT__
when you listen to some who ar run for presid __PUNCT__ you can hear it in their voic __PUNCT__
there is weight to their word __PUNCT__
but thei ar in danger of be weigh down by it all __PUNCT__
i am optimist about our countri __PUNCT__
i am optimist about the democrat parti __PUNCT__
we have the major in congress __PUNCT__
the american peopl agre with us on the issu __PUNCT__
we have the best field of candid for presid __PUNCT__ and we go to put a democrat into the white hous __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ there is too much that is wrong with america __PUNCT__
but we can also celebr what final go right __PUNCT__
the first step wa take back the congress __PUNCT__
the next step is take back the white hous __PUNCT__
that how we take back america __PUNCT__
i am go to focu my remark todai on repair the damag from the two worst mistak of the bush administr __PUNCT__ fail to address climat chang and fail to chang our polici in iraq __PUNCT__
some peopl poke fun at how i like to talk about what i done as a governor __PUNCT__
but i proud of new mexico __PUNCT__ and i proud of make new mexico the clean energi state __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ we do more to clean up the environ and fight global warm than ani other state in the countri __PUNCT__
mark twain said __PUNCT__ everybodi complain about the weather but nobodi ever doe anyth about it __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we do someth about global warm in new mexico __PUNCT__
we requir util compani to produc energi from renew sourc __PUNCT__
we invest directli in energi effici __PUNCT__
we promot renew energi with tax credit for us wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ and biofuel __PUNCT__
we elimin tax on hybrid car __PUNCT__ and i set tough standard to reduc greenhous emiss __PUNCT__
mayb the countri and presid bush don't follow the kyoto treati __PUNCT__ but my state doe __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ in hi typic fashion __PUNCT__ after six and a half year of refus to admit that global warm exist __PUNCT__ presid bush ha start lectur develop nation and tell them to clean up their act __PUNCT__
i not sure what more insult to the rest of the world __PUNCT__
tell them thei wrong for six and a half year __PUNCT__
or chang your mind and tell them thei still wrong __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ we don't need half __PUNCT__ heart half __PUNCT__ wai measur like the european agreement that just came out of the g __PUNCT__ __NUM__ summit __PUNCT__
the kyoto treati ha been sit on your desk for six and a half year __PUNCT__
you might as well sign it now __PUNCT__ becaus in a year and a half __PUNCT__ if you haven't __PUNCT__ i will __PUNCT__
i proud to have the most aggress plan of anyon run for presid __PUNCT__
within twelv year __PUNCT__ my plan would reduc global warm pollut by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ lower demand for oil by fifti percent __PUNCT__ and push fuel economi standard to __NUM__ mile per gallon __PUNCT__
by the year __NUM__ my plan would requir that __NUM__ percent of our electr be gener from renew sourc and would reduc greenhous ga emiss by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
you can read the plan for yourself at my campaign websit or you can listen to the leagu of conserv voter __PUNCT__
thei rate it the most aggress plan with the highest goal of ani other candid __PUNCT__
these aren't pie in the sky propos __PUNCT__ but thei ar ambiti __PUNCT__
if we can spend billion wage war in a countri that never had weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
then we can certainli find the will to stop the mass destruct of our planet __PUNCT__
it time that we as a nation chose the collect good over the desir to collect good __PUNCT__
and frankli __PUNCT__ bui carbon offset isn't enough __PUNCT__
just like pai somebodi els to go to church doesn't make you religi __PUNCT__
pai somebodi els to conserv doesn't make you a conservationist __PUNCT__
my wife barbara and i us both a hybrid and a flex __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl __PUNCT__ and we made the new mexico governor mansion a lot more energi effici __PUNCT__ includ compact fluoresc light __PUNCT__ low water __PUNCT__ us irrig __PUNCT__ and ceil fan to cut down on air condit __PUNCT__ and lemm tell you __PUNCT__ on a __NUM__ degre dai in new mexico __PUNCT__ that a sacrific __PUNCT__ but i know we can do more __PUNCT__ and i bet that a lot of you could __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
we all have to sacrific for the common good __PUNCT__ and we have to end our depend on middl eastern oil __PUNCT__
which bring us to iraq __PUNCT__
some will tell you that we onli have two option __PUNCT__ either stai in iraq and try to refere a civil war __PUNCT__ or leav and watch the middl east collaps into a region war __PUNCT__
when a presid decid that he or she onli ha two bad option __PUNCT__ guess what happen __PUNCT__ someth bad __PUNCT__
i have a differ view __PUNCT__ a more optimist view ground in what i call a new realism for foreign polici __PUNCT__
i applaud my fellow democrat candid for take on presid bush in the congress __PUNCT__
but there is a fundament differ in thi campaign __PUNCT__ and that how mani troop each of us would leav behind __PUNCT__
other than the customari marin conting at the embassi __PUNCT__ i would leav zero troop __PUNCT__
not a singl on __PUNCT__
and if the embassi and our embassi personnel aren't safe __PUNCT__ then thei all come home too __PUNCT__
no airbas __PUNCT__
no troop in the green zone __PUNCT__
no embed soldier train iraqi forc __PUNCT__ becaus we all know what that mean __PUNCT__
it mean our troop would still be out on patrol with target on their back __PUNCT__
a region crisi is worthi of militari intervent __PUNCT__
a true threat to our countri secur is worthi of war __PUNCT__
but a struggl between a countri war faction __PUNCT__ where both side hate the unit state __PUNCT__ is not worthi of on more lost american life __PUNCT__
with all due respect to my democrat colleagu __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ dodd __PUNCT__ and biden all vote for timelin legisl that had deliber loophol __PUNCT__
those loophol allow thi presid __PUNCT__ or ani presid __PUNCT__ to leav an undetermin number of troop in iraq indefinit __PUNCT__
__NUM__ and thi is the same legisl that former senat edward sai we should send back to presid bush over and over again until he sign it __PUNCT__
the languag in the legisl wa clear __PUNCT__
it would allow the presid to leav american troop behind for quot __PUNCT__ train and equip member of the iraqi secur forc __PUNCT__ and to protect __PUNCT__ among other thing __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ other u. __PUNCT__ forc __PUNCT__
__NUM__ troop protect troop __PUNCT__
potenti thousand of troop __PUNCT__ year after year __PUNCT__
i don't know about the other folk run __PUNCT__ but troop protect troop train other troop doesn't sound ani differ to me __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ my democrat colleagu in thi campaign think it respons to have an ongo militari role in iraq __PUNCT__
thei vote not onc but twice to leav troop behind __PUNCT__
senat clinton ha told her militari advisor that if she were elect __PUNCT__ there might still be troop in iraq at end of her second term __PUNCT__
senat obama written plan call for leav non __PUNCT__ combat troop in iraq __PUNCT__
and senat edward sai he for withdraw all troop except those at the embassi __PUNCT__
but that not what the bill sai that he want to pass again and again __PUNCT__
the respons thing to do is to look at the problem from anoth perspect __PUNCT__
at the rate we lose american live __PUNCT__ over on thousand american troop will be kill thi year alon __PUNCT__
the surg ha led to noth but a surg in american dy __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ percent of iraqi want us out of their countri __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ percent think it okai to kill american __PUNCT__
think about that for a second __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ percent were will to tell a pollster thei never met befor that it okai to kill american __PUNCT__
which mean that percentag is probabl even higher __PUNCT__
that not the case in japan __PUNCT__ germani __PUNCT__ south korea or anywher els american troop ar station __PUNCT__
i have great respect for my fellow democrat candid __PUNCT__ but for those who think we should leav a residu forc __PUNCT__ how long doe that forc need to be in place befor we can leav __PUNCT__ on year __PUNCT__ two year __PUNCT__ five __PUNCT__ ten __PUNCT__ there is not a singl sign that iraq is improv __PUNCT__
to the contrari __PUNCT__ everi indic is that it get wors __PUNCT__ and a smaller forc will do noth to chang that __PUNCT__
how mani more american must die befor we leav an iraq that will be no better off than it is todai __PUNCT__ and in a war where american troop ar the number on target __PUNCT__ who ar the poor soul you go to leav behind __PUNCT__ we need to bring them all home __PUNCT__
you can sign our petit at no troop left behind dot com __PUNCT__
the wai we help heal iraq is to bring all of our troop home within six month __PUNCT__
onli then can the hard diplomat work realli begin __PUNCT__
that how we avoid a region war __PUNCT__
i would leav troop in neighbor countri that want us __PUNCT__ like kuwait __PUNCT__ to help keep the peac __PUNCT__
but we need to hand over secur of iraq to an all muslim peacekeep forc __PUNCT__
we would then have a moral respons to do everyth we can to bring the differ faction togeth in a nation reconcili confer __PUNCT__
we also have a strateg interest in organ a region confer with all of iraq neighbor __PUNCT__ includ syria and iran __PUNCT__ to help stabil iraq __PUNCT__
no on in the region __PUNCT__ includ iran __PUNCT__ want an iraqi civil war __PUNCT__ and no on in the region __PUNCT__ especi iran __PUNCT__ want iraqi refuge __PUNCT__
some will tell you that onc we leav iraq __PUNCT__ the countri will becom a hotb of al qaeda activ __PUNCT__
that just not the case __PUNCT__
there is an old arab proverb __PUNCT__ the enemi of my enemi is my friend __PUNCT__
up until now __PUNCT__ al qaeda wa toler in iraq becaus thei were kill american __PUNCT__
onc we gone __PUNCT__ the iraqi will have no further us for al qaeda and thei will drive them out __PUNCT__
we see the begin of thi alreadi in sunni attack on al qaeda __PUNCT__ but the process will acceler onc we gone __PUNCT__
too mani iraqi have di at the hand of al qaeda and retali will be at hand __PUNCT__
two month ago in north korea __PUNCT__ i wa proud to help show how talk to your enemi can produc result __PUNCT__ like reduc the north korean nuclear threat and bring home the remain of six american servicemen __PUNCT__
the situat is similar in the middl east __PUNCT__
thi presid broke iraq __PUNCT__
the next presid ha to know how to us diplomaci to fix it __PUNCT__
i will tell you thi __PUNCT__ my world view is differ from my colleagu __PUNCT__
in my career __PUNCT__ i been abl to get result __PUNCT__ not with harsh word __PUNCT__ but hard work __PUNCT__
you talk to your adversari __PUNCT__
you listen __PUNCT__
you get to know them well if you want them to hear what you sai __PUNCT__
and with understand come resolv __PUNCT__
and with clariti come cooper __PUNCT__
it how i approach foreign affair __PUNCT__
it how i approach govern __PUNCT__
and it how i serv as presid of thi great countri __PUNCT__
more than anyth els __PUNCT__ we have a moral oblig to those american soldier and citizen who laid down their live oversea __PUNCT__
some sai we cannot let their sacrific be in vain __PUNCT__
but you will never convinc me that those slain patriot would have want a singl addit life to be lost __PUNCT__ just to valid their own sacrific __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ the moral oblig is to honor their servic by bring their mission to a close __PUNCT__
by end the bloodsh __PUNCT__ and final let the iraqi peopl and the american peopl to set a new cours __PUNCT__
those would be the principl of my presid __PUNCT__
and those would be the ideal i seek __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ god bless you __PUNCT__ god bless our troop __PUNCT__ god bless the democrat parti __PUNCT__ and god bless new mexico __PUNCT__
