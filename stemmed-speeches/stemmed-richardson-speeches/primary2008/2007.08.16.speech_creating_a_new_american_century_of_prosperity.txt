everi year __PUNCT__ we spend more than __NUM__ billion dollar just pai the interest on our nation debt __PUNCT__ that more than six time as much as we spend on the entir depart of educ __PUNCT__
how did we get here __PUNCT__ the stori is well known __PUNCT__ __MONEY__ trillion in tax cut __PUNCT__ far too skew to help the wealthiest american __PUNCT__ and runawai spend __PUNCT__ have put us deep in the red __PUNCT__
while thi presid ha blame 9/11 for our deficit __PUNCT__ the fact of the matter is that defens and homeland secur spend __PUNCT__ includ all of the hundr of billion in iraq __PUNCT__ ha account for onli on third of the post __PUNCT__ 9/11 deficit __PUNCT__
the administr misguid tax and spend prioriti account for the rest __PUNCT__

thi administr forgot to invest in our futur __PUNCT__
in hi __NUM__ state of the union __PUNCT__ presid bush shock the world by admit that america wa __PUNCT__ addict to oil __PUNCT__ suggest that we might see some invest in new energi __PUNCT__
the veri next dai __PUNCT__ the nation renew energi laboratori announc that the white hous had cut it budget by __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
how can we expect an administr that couldn't even plan it own polit a dai ahead __PUNCT__ to lead our nation toward a better futur for our children __PUNCT__ the administr fail to protect the engin of our economi __PUNCT__ the middl class __PUNCT__
product is up __PUNCT__ yet real wage ar down __PUNCT__
american worker ar hold up their end of the deal __PUNCT__ but their govern is not __PUNCT__
while presid bush wa rail against the axi of evil abroad __PUNCT__ he wa govern across an axi of irrespons here at home __PUNCT__ failur to be fiscal respons __PUNCT__ failur to invest in the futur __PUNCT__ failur to protect work american __PUNCT__
now we ar saddl with a budget deficit thei ignor and foreign debt thei don't want to talk about __PUNCT__
presid bush hasn't level with us about our nation fiscal health sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
frankli __PUNCT__ the presid is act like a spoil teenag who crash the famili car and then hope no on will notic __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ we have notic __PUNCT__
and the american govern need to stop break what the american famili ha built __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ it is time we take our futur back __PUNCT__
fiscal respons the first thing we have to do is get out of our fiscal nightmar __PUNCT__
that start with a balanc budget __PUNCT__
as a governor __PUNCT__ i have to balanc my state budget __PUNCT__
i have balanc five budget __PUNCT__ and i have done it while cut tax and invest in our peopl and our infrastructur __PUNCT__
balanc the budget is invest in the futur __PUNCT__
it mean that we ar pai for what we get todai __PUNCT__ so our children don't have to __PUNCT__
and that why i support a constitut amend to balanc the budget __PUNCT__ thi amend must also provid for a line __PUNCT__ item veto __PUNCT__
we allow republican to spend recklessli for too long __PUNCT__
our children should have the right to be free from the extraordinari debt run up by their parent __PUNCT__
ultim __PUNCT__ there is no choic between fiscal respons and fiscal prosper __PUNCT__
as we saw under the clinton administr __PUNCT__ you can't have on without the other __PUNCT__
the road to fiscal respons should begin with end the war and get all of our troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
all of them __PUNCT__
it is the right thing to do for our fight men and women __PUNCT__ it is the right thing to do for our nation defens __PUNCT__ and it is the right thing to do for our econom secur __PUNCT__
we spend over a hundr billion dollar a year hunker down in a countri that doesn't want us there __PUNCT__ fight a war that won't make us safer __PUNCT__
we want that monei back __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we need to end wast here at home __PUNCT__
no more pork __PUNCT__ barrel spend __PUNCT__
no more thousand __PUNCT__ dollar toaster __PUNCT__ no more bridg to nowher __PUNCT__
the feder budget isn't a politician piggi __PUNCT__ bank __PUNCT__

we want that monei back __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we need to slash corpor welfar __PUNCT__

it just doesn't make sens __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ presid reagan like to talk about the __PUNCT__ welfar queen __PUNCT__ who bilk the govern out of eight thousand dollar __PUNCT__
well we got welfar queen todai __PUNCT__ thei call halliburton and exxon/mobil __PUNCT__
and trust me __PUNCT__ thei get more than eight thousand dollar __PUNCT__
if we cut even half of our spend on corpor welfar __PUNCT__ american will save some __NUM__ billion dollar over the next five year __PUNCT__
we want that monei back __PUNCT__
we should also stop tax cut for individu who don't need them __PUNCT__
when i am presid we will roll back the bush tax cut for the wealthiest __PUNCT__ which will save us hundr of billion of dollar over the next five year __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we cut tax to creat job and help the middl class __PUNCT__
we will have a tax credit for compani that creat job here in america and pai abov the prevail wage __PUNCT__
i done it in new mexico and it work __PUNCT__
we have to stop give compani incent to send our job abroad __PUNCT__
we need american busi to keep american job here __PUNCT__
we will provid strong tax incent to promot renew energi becaus we need a new gener of energi entrepreneur __PUNCT__
we need new wildcatt to tap the power of wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ and biofuel __PUNCT__
the energi crisi will onli be solv by the effort of enterpris individu __PUNCT__ but govern must push the effort forward __PUNCT__
we will elimin the altern minimum tax for the middl class __PUNCT__
when the presid claim he go to balanc the budget __PUNCT__ he intend to do it on the back of million of middl class famili __PUNCT__ by forc them to pai a tax thei were never suppos to __PUNCT__
we need to right thi unintend wrong __PUNCT__
instead of forc the middl class to pai new tax __PUNCT__ we will extend the tax cut for the middl class __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will have a tax system that reflect our belief in hard work and our hope for a better tomorrow __PUNCT__
onc we repair the foundat of our economi __PUNCT__ we need to start build for the futur __PUNCT__
invest in technolog and innov america ha alwai been the world greatest purveyor of ingenu and innov __PUNCT__
more than coke and hershei bar __PUNCT__ car and comput __PUNCT__ the world know us as the preemin seller of progress and hope __PUNCT__
histor __PUNCT__ our technolog prowess ha been unmatch __PUNCT__
that is no accid __PUNCT__
becaus we valu scienc __PUNCT__ becaus we have invest in knowledg and educ __PUNCT__ we have led technolog chang __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ our strateg competitor __PUNCT__ like china __PUNCT__ ar catch up __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ thi is no accid __PUNCT__
nor is it inevit __PUNCT__
thei ar catch up becaus thei ar succeed where we have in the past __PUNCT__ but ar not todai __PUNCT__
thei ar invest heavili in math and scienc educ __PUNCT__ we ar not __PUNCT__
thei ar invest heavili in scientif research __PUNCT__ we ar cut back __PUNCT__
there is no doubt that thi come centuri will bring technolog progress we can't imagin todai __PUNCT__
emin scientist in lab and univers and unknown kid tinker in their garag will guid us to the frontier of discoveri __PUNCT__
thi will happen __PUNCT__
the question we have to ask ourselv is __PUNCT__ do we want those garag to be in china or right here in iowa __PUNCT__
do we want our nation univers just teach new knowledg __PUNCT__ or discov it __PUNCT__ there is onli on choic __PUNCT__
as a nation __PUNCT__ we have never turn our back on tomorrow __PUNCT__
the search for new frontier and the hope that we can improv is far too ingrain in our nation dna __PUNCT__
if we do not embrac progress now __PUNCT__ and invest in the futur __PUNCT__ though our border will not have chang __PUNCT__ we will not be the same nation __PUNCT__
georg bush and hi right wing alli talk about protect the __PUNCT__ free market economi __PUNCT__ to justifi their fail polici __PUNCT__
and then thei attack democrat as big taxer and over __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__
thi tire rhetor is hold us back __PUNCT__
the govern must honor the privat sector and american entrepreneurship __PUNCT__ while work with investor and partner with our entrepreneur __PUNCT__
thi is how it ha alwai been __PUNCT__
the govern start the internet __PUNCT__ and the privat sector improv and expand it into on of the cornerston of our economi __PUNCT__
in a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__ govern must act as a catalyst and a partner to help unleash the innov and the job creation potenti of the privat sector __PUNCT__

if we ar seriou about scienc __PUNCT__ then we should be seriou about fund it __PUNCT__
in particular __PUNCT__ we should increas fund to the nation institut of health __PUNCT__ so the next gener doesn't have to suffer the same diseas as thi on __PUNCT__
we need to increas fund to govern renew energi program __PUNCT__
even georg bush ha acknowledg that we ar addict to oil __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ acknowledg your addict is the first step to recoveri __PUNCT__
not the last __PUNCT__
histor __PUNCT__ new mexico ha been on of the poorest state in the nation __PUNCT__ yet we ar fund a stem cell research center __PUNCT__ and we ar innov in clean energi __PUNCT__
we should be abl to do the same in the richest nation in the world __PUNCT__
we need to connect peopl __PUNCT__
we should weav our nation wealth of knowledg __PUNCT__ capit __PUNCT__ and talent into a web of innov that can catch new technolog __PUNCT__
we all believ in a better economi and we should not be afraid to work togeth __PUNCT__
i will start by conven region innov summit where expert from busi and ventur capit __PUNCT__ academia and govern can come togeth to turn idea into realiti __PUNCT__

it take leadership on job and innov __PUNCT__ i will lead our countri just as i have led new mexico __PUNCT__
i will creat a feder angel investor tax credit and i will make perman and doubl the research and experiment tax credit __PUNCT__
we must provid incent for invest and experiment in high __PUNCT__ tech research and manufactur __PUNCT__
for our economi to get the oxygen it need breath __PUNCT__ we must grow the tree of technolog __PUNCT__
and that requir plant the seed of invest __PUNCT__
we have the angel investor tax credit in new mexico for high __PUNCT__ tech startup that ar creat the job of the futur __PUNCT__
and it work __PUNCT__

it is thi determin __PUNCT__ thi strength of will __PUNCT__ that produc the light bulb __PUNCT__ the car __PUNCT__ the comput __PUNCT__
i believ that if we ar to continu our econom and innov success __PUNCT__ we need to reward that great american spirit __PUNCT__
and we must also support innov in our young peopl __PUNCT__
the first point in the web of innov must be our student __PUNCT__
becaus the next gener of technolog mean noth __PUNCT__ unless the next gener of american know how to us it __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ we rank __NUM__ in the world in math and scienc educ __PUNCT__
china and india produc far more engin than we do __PUNCT__
thi is unaccept and irrespons __PUNCT__
despit the overwhelm focu of the popular media __PUNCT__ the true foreign threat to american job secur doesn't come from uneduc __PUNCT__ low __PUNCT__ wage worker from poor countri __PUNCT__
it come from highli __PUNCT__ educ middl __PUNCT__ class worker from these emerg econom giant __PUNCT__
we must act now __PUNCT__
we must build __NUM__ math __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ and innov academi by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
these academi will offer rigor math and scienc instruct __PUNCT__ free of charg __PUNCT__ to seventh __PUNCT__ through __PUNCT__ twelfth grader who want it __PUNCT__
thei will train the next wave of american engin __PUNCT__ mathematician __PUNCT__ scientist and teacher __PUNCT__
it a simpl equat __PUNCT__ talent math and scienc teacher lead to inspir and success math and scienc student __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will commit to hire on __PUNCT__ hundr __PUNCT__ thousand new math and scienc teacher to guarante that our children and our nation ar competit in the world __PUNCT__
the kei to econom progress is educ __PUNCT__ and the kei to educ is a good teacher in the classroom __PUNCT__
hire these teacher will cost us three to four billion dollar __PUNCT__ that is less than on on __PUNCT__ hundreth the amount we pai in interest on our nation debt __PUNCT__
it is a small price to pai for a competit futur __PUNCT__
if we want to speak the languag of progress __PUNCT__ our kid must be fluent in scienc and math __PUNCT__
invest in peopl while we build for the futur and repair the damag of the past __PUNCT__ we must also invest in our peopl now __PUNCT__
we need to move aggress to creat high __PUNCT__ qualiti job and expand econom opportun __PUNCT__
the american dream ha alwai been big __PUNCT__ big enough for all of us __PUNCT__
but for too mani these dai __PUNCT__ the dream is shrink and shut them out __PUNCT__
that is unaccept __PUNCT__ everi american deserv the opportun to succe __PUNCT__
we need to get back to big dream and big idea __PUNCT__
if we want more qualiti job __PUNCT__ we should give compani incent to creat them __PUNCT__
i will offer rebat for busi that hire disadvantag children in high school and colleg __PUNCT__
i will creat a rural job tax credit for compani that creat job in rural area and a tax credit for busi that creat manufactur job __PUNCT__
i will also provid tax credit to support new busi in emerg technolog and in low __PUNCT__ incom area __PUNCT__
i will quadrupl the energi tax credit for green job __PUNCT__ job that ar good for the the american worker and the american environ __PUNCT__
just as much as comput programm and engin __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ effici sheet metal worker __PUNCT__ plumber __PUNCT__ electrician __PUNCT__ and mason ar the kei to our econom futur __PUNCT__
i will lead an apollo program for renew energi __PUNCT__ green build __PUNCT__ and energi effici __PUNCT__
thi is the high technolog of the futur and america must lead it __PUNCT__
i agre with the apollo allianc on thi issu __PUNCT__
green build is good for the environ __PUNCT__ it good for our worker and it good for our energi bill __PUNCT__ no wonder the bush administr is against it __PUNCT__
the govern must not onli lead the wai on a new gener of green build __PUNCT__ but we must also encourag retrofit our exist busi __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ instead of build bridg to nowher __PUNCT__ we need to look at our critic infrastructur __PUNCT__ our bridg __PUNCT__ road __PUNCT__ transport that lead our peopl to work everydai __PUNCT__
a public/priv partnership __PUNCT__ with union involv __PUNCT__ on green build and revit america infrastructur __PUNCT__ will creat more high __PUNCT__ pai job for worker right here in cedar rapid __PUNCT__
right here at ibew local __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we need tax and job polici that work __PUNCT__
i shape effect tax polici in new mexico that have creat over __NUM__ job __PUNCT__ driven unemploy to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ a histor low __PUNCT__ and lift person incom __PUNCT__
i know how to get our economi work for all american __PUNCT__
in addit to creat new qualiti job __PUNCT__ we need to preserv the on we alreadi have __PUNCT__
we should restor america focu on protect our labor forc __PUNCT__
first of all __PUNCT__ let me sai that i will be a friend to work american __PUNCT__ till the dai i die __PUNCT__
on of my first act as governor wa to reinstat collect bargain for public employe in new mexico __PUNCT__
we then dramat increas health benefit and salari __PUNCT__
we rais our teacher salari from __NUM__ to __NUM__ in the nation __PUNCT__
i fought hard to rais the minimum wage in my state __PUNCT__ and i have improv worker safeti __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ my secretari of labor will be a union member __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will protect the right to collect bargain and the right to form union __PUNCT__
i will strongli support the employe free choic act __PUNCT__
how can we as a nation ask american worker to help protect our futur __PUNCT__ if we don't allow them to protect their __PUNCT__ when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will improv all worker __PUNCT__ safeti __PUNCT__
presid bush ha spent the past six year erod safeti regul and endang our workforc __PUNCT__
how do we expect our economi to grow if it worker aren't safe __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ i will index the minimum wage to inflat __PUNCT__
the minimum wage is not just some number __PUNCT__ it is a realiti for mani american famili __PUNCT__
i believ a fair dai work deserv a fair dai pai __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
how can we even begin to build respons __PUNCT__ fair __PUNCT__ and a new american dream if we ar not strong enough to honor thi basic principl __PUNCT__ we must also move beyond the debat over __PUNCT__ free trade __PUNCT__ versu __PUNCT__ protection __PUNCT__
instead we must roll up our sleev and pursu better trade agreement __PUNCT__ agreement that enhanc rather than erod u. __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ and that ar social just __PUNCT__ environment respons and polit sustain __PUNCT__
we also need to help famili with the rise cost of live __PUNCT__
expens for health care __PUNCT__ child care __PUNCT__ and a colleg educ ar rise faster than wage and our next presid must focu on make these more afford __PUNCT__
our nation strength is our peopl __PUNCT__ and we must do whatev it take to protect that resourc __PUNCT__
conclus there is no doubt that we face seriou challeng __PUNCT__ not the least of which is a presid who refus to face up to them __PUNCT__
we ar fall behind china in math and scienc __PUNCT__ while we run up a nation debt __PUNCT__ much of which is own by that veri countri __PUNCT__
when presid bush sai he increas educ fund __PUNCT__ he right __PUNCT__
he increas educ fund in china __PUNCT__ in india __PUNCT__ and everi other nation that own our debt __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we ar effect pai the world to surpass us technolog __PUNCT__
that just not right __PUNCT__
we face great challeng __PUNCT__ but we ar the greatest nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__ and our govern need to start act like it __PUNCT__
we need to get back to big american dream __PUNCT__
we need to get back to the forward __PUNCT__ look nation that search out new frontier __PUNCT__
at the turn of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we were a hand of state huddl along the east coast __PUNCT__
by the end of that centuri __PUNCT__ our nation span the contin __PUNCT__
american rode out west on hors and drove back in car __PUNCT__
our nation is more than a piec of land or a set of law __PUNCT__
america is the belief that tomorrow can be better than todai __PUNCT__
and unit we can do it __PUNCT__
