thank you for have me here __PUNCT__
it is an honor to be abl to share with you todai my thought about how we can end the war in iraq __PUNCT__ and also to discuss some lesson which we must learn from thi ongo tragedi __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ brave american have lost their live __PUNCT__
nearli __NUM__ have been wound __PUNCT__ mani veri serious __PUNCT__
__NUM__ ar still at risk __PUNCT__
in addit to our troop __PUNCT__ at least a hundr thousand iraqi civilian have been kill in thi conflict __PUNCT__
over four million more __PUNCT__ fifteen percent of the countri popul __PUNCT__ have lost their home and becom displac __PUNCT__
nineti __PUNCT__ three percent of sunni and over half the shia think it okai to shoot an american __PUNCT__
the iraqi want us out of their countri __PUNCT__
despit our best intent __PUNCT__ the american presenc is not aid the caus of peac __PUNCT__ but rather contribut to the cycl of violenc __PUNCT__
it did not have to be thi wai __PUNCT__
our militari is the best __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ best __PUNCT__ equip __PUNCT__ most power fight forc in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
tragic __PUNCT__ the awesom power of our militari ha been match in scale by the reckless incompet of our civilian leadership __PUNCT__
the presid and vice __PUNCT__ presid have blunder and mismanag thi conflict at everi possibl turn __PUNCT__
thi catastroph did not need to happen __PUNCT__
mani of us __PUNCT__ on the ev of thi war __PUNCT__ counsel greater diplomaci and more patienc __PUNCT__
our warn were ignor and the result ha been the quagmir in which we find ourselv __PUNCT__
whether we ar democrat __PUNCT__ independ or republican __PUNCT__ all american want the violenc to end __PUNCT__
we all know that we must not allow the region to collaps into greater chao and war __PUNCT__
we all know how import it is that our militari be strong and abl to meet futur threat __PUNCT__
we all want our brave militari men and women out of harm wai __PUNCT__
the question __PUNCT__ go forward __PUNCT__ is how we accomplish these goal __PUNCT__
presid bush sai that we need to stai the cours __PUNCT__ indefinit __PUNCT__
he want us to stick with a strategi that ha fail week after week __PUNCT__ month after month __PUNCT__ year after year __PUNCT__ in the hope that __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ somehow __PUNCT__ it will succe __PUNCT__
our troop have done all that thei have been ask to do __PUNCT__ with courag and profession __PUNCT__ but no on can win someon els civil war __PUNCT__
in the absenc of polit progress __PUNCT__ our continu presenc in iraq is increasingli counter __PUNCT__ product __PUNCT__
our troop in iraq ar now the biggest obstacl to polit chang __PUNCT__
if we stai on the present cours __PUNCT__ if we mere tinker with the mission as some have suggest __PUNCT__ historian mai look back on the first decad of thi centuri as the moment in which the unit state foolishli overstretch itself __PUNCT__ begin the long __PUNCT__ term declin of american power and global leadership __PUNCT__
onli our departur can break the polit stalem and give us diplomat leverag to promot reconcili and region diplomaci __PUNCT__
the longer we stai __PUNCT__ the more u. __PUNCT__ troop will die __PUNCT__ the more iraqi civilian will be kill __PUNCT__ and the more elus stabil will becom __PUNCT__
delai the inevit is not a strategi __PUNCT__
it is not us __PUNCT__
it is not respons __PUNCT__
it is not courag __PUNCT__
it is not moral __PUNCT__
i know that the presid is wrong and you know he wrong __PUNCT__
he doe not __PUNCT__ and perhap cannot __PUNCT__ understand the dire realiti of the situat __PUNCT__
throughout hi presid __PUNCT__ bush ha deni realiti and avoid difficult choic __PUNCT__
after 9/11 __PUNCT__ he sent the militari to war __PUNCT__ while he ask the nation to go shop __PUNCT__
in an all __PUNCT__ out war against terror __PUNCT__ he ask the countri to be part __PUNCT__ time patriot __PUNCT__
we must stop thi presid and end thi war __PUNCT__
the foundat of my iraq plan is thi __PUNCT__ get out now __PUNCT__
get all our troop out now __PUNCT__
it is the onli right and respons choic __PUNCT__
onli when we ar on our wai out will iraqi and other in the region start to see us as partner rather than as occupi __PUNCT__
onli then can a new polit and diplomat process begin __PUNCT__
so long as we ar there __PUNCT__ with a bull __PUNCT__ ey on our back __PUNCT__ the situat cannot chang for the better __PUNCT__
onli by withdraw all of our troop can we give our militari the opportun to rest __PUNCT__ refit __PUNCT__ and retrain __PUNCT__
our militari ha been strain to the break point by thi presid __PUNCT__
our troop ar serv longer tour in iraq than thei ar spend with their famili or train back at home __PUNCT__ fifteen month tour __PUNCT__
nation guard unit ar unabl to perform essenti mission here in the us where thei ar need for homeland secur __PUNCT__
much of our equip is wear down __PUNCT__ and the corros of our hard power is limit the leverag of our soft power __PUNCT__
becaus of iraq __PUNCT__ we cannot focu on the real threat to our secur __PUNCT__ a fact acknowledg even by gener petraeu and ambassador crocker in their recent senat testimoni __PUNCT__
becaus of iraq __PUNCT__ al qaeda ha been abl to reconstitut itself __PUNCT__
todai it is stronger than ever __PUNCT__ train terrorist along the pakistan __PUNCT__ afghanistan border __PUNCT__
becaus of iraq __PUNCT__ we have lost the credibl we need to lead the world to stop nuclear prolifer and traffick __PUNCT__
presid bush fail strategi ha made us both pariah and patron of both sunni and shia __PUNCT__
we ar both alli and enemi of iraqi faction __PUNCT__
and we subsid their power struggl with american live and dollar __PUNCT__
thi endless __PUNCT__ multi __PUNCT__ side violenc ha muddi our strateg purpos __PUNCT__
and the presid desper refus to face realiti ha confus our moral compass __PUNCT__
i know thi region __PUNCT__
as us ambassador to the unit nation __PUNCT__ i spent eighti percent of my time on the middl east __PUNCT__
i have negoti with mani arab and muslim leader __PUNCT__ includ the saudi __PUNCT__ the iranian __PUNCT__ even the taliban __PUNCT__
i stood toe __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ toe with saddam hussein and got him to releas american hostag __PUNCT__
i understand the polit and the mental of that part of the world __PUNCT__
onli onc we make it clear that we ar leav can we expect the iraqi to make the tough choic necessari for reconcili __PUNCT__
onli onc all of our troop ar on their wai out __PUNCT__ will other in the region do what thei must to prevent iraq from collaps __PUNCT__
onli our departur will give us the credibl to conven a dayton __PUNCT__ style reconcili confer to build a power __PUNCT__ share arrang polic by multilater __PUNCT__ un __PUNCT__ sanction peacekeep __PUNCT__
to the extent that such a conting is staf by disciplin forc from non __PUNCT__ neighbor muslim countri __PUNCT__ it will have a credibl which western troop simpli don't have in that part of the world __PUNCT__
and onli when we leav can we expect rich countri from the region and elsewher to help financ iraq reconstruct __PUNCT__
we cannot follow bush exampl of ignor the govern of iran and syria __PUNCT__
we must work with them as we pull our troop out __PUNCT__
thei too have an enorm stake in not allow iraq to collaps __PUNCT__
the subsequ flood of refuge and econom destruct would caus immeasur damag to their own nation interest __PUNCT__
the bush administr current approach to iran is as wronghead as it iraq polici __PUNCT__
and some in the senat __PUNCT__ includ senat clinton __PUNCT__ have aid thi approach by vote for their irrespons resolut on iran __PUNCT__
peopl want to end thi war in iraq __PUNCT__ not start anoth on __PUNCT__
iran must not be allow to have nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
i will make that commit as presid __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ an attack on iran will make them stronger __PUNCT__ not weaker __PUNCT__ in the islam world __PUNCT__
senat clinton ha it exactli backward __PUNCT__
to accomplish our goal with iran __PUNCT__ we have to put diplomaci first __PUNCT__ not saber rattl __PUNCT__
no countri ha ever been forc to give up nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ mani have been persuad to furthermor __PUNCT__ there is onli on wai to accomplish our object in iraq __PUNCT__
there is onli on respons wai forward __PUNCT__ get all our troop out and get them out now __PUNCT__
we must also remov the privat mercenari __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will no longer privat and outsourc american secur __PUNCT__ by util contractor who ar not subject to the rule of war or the regul of arm forc __PUNCT__ georg bush ha further undermin america reput and global leadership __PUNCT__
it no surpris that presid bush doesn't see that __PUNCT__
from the begin of thi war __PUNCT__ up through thi fatal surg __PUNCT__ the presid ha refus to make the hard choic or the right choic __PUNCT__
the whole point of the surg wa to give breath room to iraqi politician __PUNCT__ and it ha fail miser __PUNCT__
even gener petraeu admit that there ha been no polit progress __PUNCT__
after seven year of thi administr __PUNCT__ we have come to expect that georg bush will make the wrong call on the import issu __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ i expect more __PUNCT__ much more __PUNCT__ from my fellow democrat in thi race __PUNCT__
hillari clinton __PUNCT__ barack obama and john edward have said we have to wait and see how thing go befor we can know how mani troop to bring out and how quickli __PUNCT__
i sai there ha been enough wait and see __PUNCT__
if you haven't seen enough to know that we need to get all the troop out then you aren't watch the same war that i and the rest of america ar see __PUNCT__
i don't think just chang the mission is enough __PUNCT__ we need to end the war __PUNCT__
senat clinton ha reportedli said that she might well have troop still in iraq at the end of a second term __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__
senat obama and john edward ar unwil to commit to remov all of the troop by the end of their first term __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ year from now __PUNCT__
i am oppos to __NUM__ year or __NUM__ year or ani more year of our troop dy __PUNCT__
my colleagu ar wrong __PUNCT__
militari analyst have said that senat clinton plan could requir leav up to __NUM__ troop in iraq __PUNCT__
that chang the mission __PUNCT__ not end the war __PUNCT__
obama and edward have said that thei will pull our combat troop out __PUNCT__ but thei would leav thousand __PUNCT__ ten of thousand of non __PUNCT__ combat troop behind __PUNCT__
think of what thi mean __PUNCT__ ten of thousand of support troop __PUNCT__ unprotect __PUNCT__ in the middl of a civil war __PUNCT__
that is chang the mission __PUNCT__ not end the war __PUNCT__
what do thei think such a smaller forc __PUNCT__ with no combat protect __PUNCT__ can accomplish that __NUM__ troop could not __PUNCT__ i have ask them __PUNCT__ over and over again __PUNCT__ everi chanc i get __PUNCT__
their silenc ha been deafen __PUNCT__
i deepli respect my democrat colleagu __PUNCT__ but their plan simpli will not end thi war __PUNCT__
it is go to take more than a sound bite and more than wait and see __PUNCT__ it is go to take decis leadership __PUNCT__
thi is no time for polit calcul or hope caution __PUNCT__
our troop __PUNCT__ live ar on the line __PUNCT__
we need a respons __PUNCT__ comprehens strategi to end the war and the strength to execut it __PUNCT__
we need to get all of our troop out __PUNCT__
and we need to do it as quickli as possibl __PUNCT__
what my colleagu ar suggest __PUNCT__ a slow __PUNCT__ protract exit __PUNCT__ will onli multipli the casualti and delai polit progress __PUNCT__
presid nixon chose such a slow departur from vietnam __PUNCT__
it led to __NUM__ addit american death and perhap anoth million vietnames death __PUNCT__
and it accomplish noth __PUNCT__ soon after we left __PUNCT__ the communist took over __PUNCT__
move all the troop out quickli will requir care plan __PUNCT__ but it can be done __PUNCT__
in accord with armi doctrin __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ combat troop should leav the theatr first __PUNCT__
not the other wai around as mani of my colleagu suggest __PUNCT__
their approach would leav our men and women far more vulner __PUNCT__
we have rotat as mani as __NUM__ troop into and out of iraq in a three __PUNCT__ month period earlier in thi war __PUNCT__
after the first gulf war __PUNCT__ we redeploi a half million troop in a period of four month __PUNCT__
as we redeploi __PUNCT__ we also must work close with turkei to insur the stabil of the border and the secur of kurdish area __PUNCT__
rapid maneuv is on of the time honor strength of our militari __PUNCT__
swift movement save live __PUNCT__ the longer a redeploy take __PUNCT__ the longer our brave troop will remain under fire __PUNCT__
i have confid in our arm forc __PUNCT__
the naysay who doubt our capabl to get out rapidli and safe ar wrong __PUNCT__
to rejoin the fight against the taliban and al qaeda __PUNCT__ and to encourag greater effort by pakistan and our nato alli __PUNCT__ we should redeploi addit combat brigad to afghanistan __PUNCT__
some troop also must redeploi into quick strike forc base in the unit arab emir __PUNCT__ qatar __PUNCT__ and bahrain __PUNCT__
our militari presenc in friendli nation will enabl us to meet new danger and hit al qaeda train camp wherev thei might appear __PUNCT__
respect expert like sandi berger __PUNCT__ dr __PUNCT__ lawrenc korb __PUNCT__ gener william odom __PUNCT__ and gener robert gard have look at the evid and come to similar conclus to mine __PUNCT__
thei know that washington groupthink is no substitut for care analysi of real option __PUNCT__
you mai have heard me speak elsewher about my foreign polici __PUNCT__ the new realism __PUNCT__
i believ that to meet the challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ america must move beyond both the fantasi of neo __PUNCT__ conservat __PUNCT__ and also beyond the limit of tradit old __PUNCT__ world balanc __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ power realism __PUNCT__
we must face the realiti that global threat have chang __PUNCT__
great danger come not just from hostil nation __PUNCT__ but also from hostil individu and fail state __PUNCT__ as well as from underli social and econom trend __PUNCT__ like our continu addict to fossil fuel __PUNCT__
these ar danger that threaten everi person on the planet __PUNCT__
jihad __PUNCT__ aid __PUNCT__ nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ and climat chang do not respect nation border __PUNCT__
and no nation can meet these challeng alon __PUNCT__
our nation interest ar global interest __PUNCT__
restor american leadership mean abandon rogu cowboi diplomaci __PUNCT__
it mean give up the idea of stubbor as a foreign polici __PUNCT__
it mean restor those american principl that onc allow us to build the allianc that defeat the nazi and crumbl the soviet union __PUNCT__
rebuild american diplomaci will requir power __PUNCT__
let us have no illus __PUNCT__ we do have the power __PUNCT__
we have the power in the strongest militari forc in the world __PUNCT__ the strongest economi in the world and an unmatch technolog prowess __PUNCT__
we must combin these extraordinairi strength with a __PUNCT__ new realism __PUNCT__ to better confront the challeng that we face __PUNCT__
construct thi new realism will requir abandon the illus that america can lead without legitimaci __PUNCT__
diplomaci without power is weak __PUNCT__ and power without diplomaci is blind __PUNCT__
other will choos to follow us onli when thei share our goal and admir our valu __PUNCT__
the chao and disord in iraq teach us that in todai world our arm forc need to defeat more than just armi __PUNCT__
thei also must defeat hatr and propaganda __PUNCT__
our militari must be the fist that destroi our enemi __PUNCT__ but it also must be a steadfast hand that creat a better peac __PUNCT__
nearli five year after the initi invas __PUNCT__ our militari is battl __PUNCT__ test __PUNCT__ but war __PUNCT__ weari __PUNCT__
bush and chenei threw our troop into the fire in iraq __PUNCT__
but now we must forg from that fire someth stronger and more adapt to the new danger we face __PUNCT__
we need to learn from iraq and make sure that our militari is prepar to deter __PUNCT__ fight __PUNCT__ and win the war of the futur __PUNCT__
and to fight __NUM__ centuri war __PUNCT__ we need a __NUM__ centuri militari __PUNCT__
on lesson we must learn is to give our gener the number thei need for post __PUNCT__ war stabil __PUNCT__
anoth lesson is to make sure that our troop ar train for the complex task thei will face __PUNCT__
nineti __PUNCT__ seven percent of us death in the war have occur after the end of so __PUNCT__ call major combat oper __PUNCT__ after __PUNCT__ quote,miss accomplish __PUNCT__
we need to forg a militari than can win both the war and the peac __PUNCT__
the militari paradigm of thi centuri will be what retir marin command gener charl krulak __PUNCT__ crew __PUNCT__ lack __PUNCT__ ha call the three __PUNCT__ block war __PUNCT__
in thi war __PUNCT__ the line between combat __PUNCT__ stabil __PUNCT__ and humanitarian oper blur __PUNCT__ soldier deliv humanitarian aid on on block of a citi __PUNCT__ conduct stabil oper on the next block __PUNCT__ and fight an arm enemi on the third __PUNCT__
thi is precis what is happen in iraq on a vast scale __PUNCT__
our militari must be prepar for thi new kind of war __PUNCT__
our militari cultur must adapt to thi new realiti __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will ensur that our soldier alwai have the best tool to crush everi possibl enemi __PUNCT__
a war __PUNCT__ fight abil that emphas the precis and overwhelm applic of forc will remain the centerpeic of our militari cultur __PUNCT__
thi is my unwav commit __PUNCT__
our challeng will be to augment thi foundat with a new __PUNCT__ larger and better train forc __PUNCT__
we can strengthen and expand our militari through sever reform __PUNCT__
we need promot and select polici that incentiv learn the skill __PUNCT__ set need for counter __PUNCT__ insurg __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ keep __PUNCT__ conflict resolut __PUNCT__ and train foreign militari __PUNCT__
we should creat perman civil affair posit __PUNCT__ troop who bridg the gap between soldier and civilian __PUNCT__ into all appropri unit __PUNCT__ and we should expand civil affair train for all soldier and marin like to interact with foreign nation __PUNCT__
we must better integr civilian into our militari oper so there is seamless coordin among militari __PUNCT__ diplomat and polit action __PUNCT__
we need to increas cross __PUNCT__ agenc tour of duti between the militari and other part of govern __PUNCT__
the person relationship and institut knowledg share dure these tour will strengthen the versatil and effect of our fight forc __PUNCT__
we also need to make the militari more attract to men and women who have real experi in nation __PUNCT__ build and social and econom develop __PUNCT__
just as we do for chaplain __PUNCT__ doctor and lawyer __PUNCT__ profession with such skill should be abl to enter the militari as warrant offic or at the rank of captain __PUNCT__
as we reform train and select __PUNCT__ we must reorder our budget prioriti __PUNCT__
i have produc a plan that includ __MONEY__ billion in specif cut to unnecessari pentagon spend __PUNCT__ such as the v __PUNCT__ __NUM__ osprei __PUNCT__ free up resourc for essenti need __PUNCT__
we need to invest less in plane and more in peopl __PUNCT__ less in outdat missil and more in state __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ art troop __PUNCT__
after year of excess us __PUNCT__ we must refit our militari deplet equip stock __PUNCT__
we must strengthen law that protect our deploi guardsmen and reservist from lose their job and busi __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ we will stop wast billion of dollar on cold war weapon system design to fight a long extinct soviet empir __PUNCT__
we will save ten of billion of dollar more by stop the construct of unnecessari new nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
instead of build new nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ we should be negoti further reduct in all nuclear arsen around the world __PUNCT__
in an ag of terror __PUNCT__ the greatest nuclear threat will come not on a missil __PUNCT__ but rather in a suitcas or a cargo hull __PUNCT__
to meet the danger of nuclear terror __PUNCT__ we need to reduc the number of weapon in the world __PUNCT__ and we need to consolid and secur fissil materi around the globe __PUNCT__
protect america from thi veri real threat of nuclear terror will requir new think and global negoti __PUNCT__
it will requir focus and determin american leadership __PUNCT__
it will not requir new nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
it will not requir star war __PUNCT__
our nation militari effect will __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ requir more troop in uniform __PUNCT__
we should never again hear the phrase stop __PUNCT__ loss or extend deploy __PUNCT__
we need two more activ armi divis and on addit activ marin corp divis __PUNCT__
thi will expand our militari by some __NUM__ troop and give us the flexibl we need for __NUM__ centuri mission __PUNCT__
the respons wai forward for iraq and for our militari will not be travel easili __PUNCT__
hard choic lie ahead __PUNCT__
we have to get out of iraq __PUNCT__ learn from error made __PUNCT__ and augment and reform our militari so that it can meet the new challeng of a new era __PUNCT__
difficult dai inde lie ahead __PUNCT__ as we recov from the iraq debacl __PUNCT__ restor and modern our militari __PUNCT__ and rebuild our reput as a nation that lead other toward nobl and worthi goal __PUNCT__
the challeng ar mani __PUNCT__ but as the next presid __PUNCT__ i am commit to meet them __PUNCT__
and with your support we cannot fail __PUNCT__
mai god bless our fight men and women __PUNCT__ and god bless america __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
