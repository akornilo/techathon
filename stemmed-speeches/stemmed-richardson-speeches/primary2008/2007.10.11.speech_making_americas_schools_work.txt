in the twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri __PUNCT__ colleg cannot be the provinc of the wealthi and the elit __PUNCT__
in our increasingli competit world __PUNCT__ higher educ is often an absolut requir for a decent job __PUNCT__
but these dai __PUNCT__ too mani of our young peopl ar unprepar for colleg __PUNCT__

it is unaccept __PUNCT__
as a nation __PUNCT__ we cannot abid the statu quo __PUNCT__ and we cannot afford fewer colleg graduat __PUNCT__
the cost is simpli too high __PUNCT__
whenev presid bush cut access to colleg __PUNCT__ he cut back hope __PUNCT__ and he cut down progress __PUNCT__
we must do better __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will make colleg afford and access to everi high school graduat who want to attend __PUNCT__

and if we ar to uphold thi solemn promis __PUNCT__ then our commit to educ cannot end with high school __PUNCT__

i know how to creat and maintain qualiti job __PUNCT__ and i know we can do it across the countri __PUNCT__
while workforc develop cannot be dictat by the bureaucraci in washington __PUNCT__ the presid must lead on thi issu __PUNCT__
in the face of global and lost job __PUNCT__ the govern must help work american in transit __PUNCT__
we also have to give underserv american the opportun to learn the skill thei need to succe in the workforc __PUNCT__
