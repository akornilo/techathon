becaus we have choic to make __PUNCT__ and the stake ar veri high __PUNCT__
both asian and non __PUNCT__ asian will make decis in the come year that determin whether our futur is on of common endeavor or of geo __PUNCT__ polit tension __PUNCT__
whether our economi prosper togeth or stagnat separ behind protectionist wall __PUNCT__
whether we tackl urgent common challeng like global warm __PUNCT__ or fail to act __PUNCT__
to build a futur of cooper rather than content __PUNCT__ we need to be realist __PUNCT__
there will alwai be rivalri among great power __PUNCT__ and nation alwai will have __PUNCT__ at time __PUNCT__ conflict interest and differ valu __PUNCT__
we cannot elimin all rivalri and conflict and differ __PUNCT__ but we can choos to be judici and far __PUNCT__ sight in how we manag them __PUNCT__
there ar step we can take __PUNCT__ and i am here todai to share with you my vision for the futur of u.s. __PUNCT__ asian relat __PUNCT__
the unit state should lead asia toward balanc multi __PUNCT__ polar secur arrang __PUNCT__
we must develop a realist approach to china econom growth __PUNCT__
thi includ us trade agreement to incentiv human right improv __PUNCT__
india and japan should becom member of the g8 __PUNCT__
we should consid new multilater trade talk to address financi __PUNCT__ environment __PUNCT__ and human right issu __PUNCT__
succumb to nation and fear is easi __PUNCT__
overcom such impuls is hard __PUNCT__
diplomaci doe not just happen __PUNCT__
we need to make it happen __PUNCT__
and becaus the stake ar so high __PUNCT__ we need to make it succe __PUNCT__
nowher ar the stake higher than in north korea __PUNCT__
i wa there last week __PUNCT__ at the invit of the dprk __PUNCT__ and a bipartisan deleg head by myself and former us secretari of veteran affair anthoni principi __PUNCT__
our job wa to bring the remain of six us servicemen home __PUNCT__
we did our job and the remain of these honor men __PUNCT__ who gave their live to defend our countri __PUNCT__ will soon be return to their famili __PUNCT__
dure our trip to north korea __PUNCT__ we also made progress on sever issu relat to the six __PUNCT__ parti talk and timelin for shut down the yongbyon reactor __PUNCT__
we agre to the follow four point __PUNCT__ the dprk reaffirm their commit to the __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ initi action agreement __PUNCT__
the treasuri and macao bda announc the releas of all dprk fund __PUNCT__
the dprk commit that within a dai of receiv the fund will invit the iaea to pyongyang to draw up the term for shut down the reactor __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i impress upon the dprk the need to resum the six __PUNCT__ parti talk __PUNCT__ to finish the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ dai initi action phase __PUNCT__ and to draw up the final phase of disabl and declar __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i been critic in the past of the bush administr __PUNCT__ and i will be critic again __PUNCT__
but on thi mission of nation secur __PUNCT__ polit stop at the water edg __PUNCT__
i believ that by directli engag with north korea __PUNCT__ we took a step toward a nuclear __PUNCT__ free korean peninsula __PUNCT__
it thi type of tough talk and direct engag that is the basi of my approach to american foreign polici __PUNCT__ an approach i call __PUNCT__ new realism __PUNCT__ i believ we need a new realism for the __NUM__ centuri that understand that diplomaci without power is weak __PUNCT__ but power without diplomaci is blind __PUNCT__
the paradox of america power is that we cannot solv our problem without friend and alli __PUNCT__
terror __PUNCT__ global warm and nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ do not threaten just us __PUNCT__ thei threaten everyon __PUNCT__
and mani danger todai come not from state target us with missil __PUNCT__ but rather our own consumpt of fossil fuel __PUNCT__
not so much from hostil state as from hostil individu and network __PUNCT__
in such a world __PUNCT__ everi nation secur ha becom ti to everi other nation secur __PUNCT__
everi nation prosper depend on the health of the global economi __PUNCT__
and we all share the same fragil and stress planet __PUNCT__ whose ecolog limit need to be respect __PUNCT__
not just the danger __PUNCT__ but also the opportun of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ increasingli ar global __PUNCT__
for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ we have a chanc to elimin hunger and extrem poverti __PUNCT__
will we have the wisdom and the skill to har thi power __PUNCT__ we also have the opportun to combat the apocalypt fantasi of jihadist __PUNCT__ by provid a billion muslim with a posit vision of hope and job __PUNCT__
we have the chanc to construct an environment __PUNCT__ sustain post __PUNCT__ carbon economi __PUNCT__
and we have the possibl to integr all of the great power into a stabl intern order __PUNCT__
america moral author ha been damag in recent year __PUNCT__
we must restor our reput as a nation which respect human right and intern law __PUNCT__ and which valu the opinion of other __PUNCT__
onli by so do can we recov the capac for moral leadership which for decad serv us so well __PUNCT__
build a safe and prosper __NUM__ centuri will requir vision and hard work from establish power like the us and japan __PUNCT__ and from rise power like china and india __PUNCT__
for mani year now __PUNCT__ chines leader and strateg analyst have stress that china rise as a global power will not threaten other __PUNCT__
other disagre __PUNCT__ thei believ that china rise will threaten other asian nation and perhap even lead to a new cold war between china and the us and it alli __PUNCT__
we need to be realist __PUNCT__
there is a risk that china rise will threaten it neighbor __PUNCT__
there is the risk of a new cold war __PUNCT__
but thi is not inevit __PUNCT__
i believ that the chines leadership is sincer in their desir to rise in a respons __PUNCT__ peac wai __PUNCT__
their prosper __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ is base upon global and export __PUNCT__ and a belliger foreign polici would place the veri engin of their growth at risk __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ china must end it histori of provoc statement and action on taiwan that place the stabil of the region at risk __PUNCT__
we must do our part __PUNCT__ and thei must do their __PUNCT__
china must also improv it human right record and respect the univers declar on human right __PUNCT__
in my experi as a diplomat __PUNCT__ public scold do not work __PUNCT__ but econom incent often do __PUNCT__
accordingli __PUNCT__ we should negoti firmli with the chines on human right __PUNCT__ and develop trade agreement should be us to incentiv human right improv __PUNCT__
i would stress __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ that the singl most import thing that america can do for human right global __PUNCT__ is to be impecc in our own behavior __PUNCT__
we need to end bush administr polici which ar inconsist with the geneva convent and intern law __PUNCT__
and we need to join the intern crimin court __PUNCT__
we should alwai encourag china to moder in it relat with it neighbor __PUNCT__
there ar sign that china wish to particip in a stabl __PUNCT__ peac asia __PUNCT__ and america should show it support __PUNCT__
we should work with china __PUNCT__ as sudan top trade partner __PUNCT__ to end the genocid in darfur and restabil to westernafrica __PUNCT__
and we should with all of east and south asia to end the militari occup of burma __PUNCT__
chines militari modern __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ make everyon nervou __PUNCT__
the best wai for china to reassur it neighbor and the us __PUNCT__ that it is not seek hegemoni over the region __PUNCT__ is to be transpar about what it is do __PUNCT__ and to work with other to reassur them that it modern is not aim at them __PUNCT__
to prevent the kind of spiral of distrust that lead to war and cold war __PUNCT__ all parti need to be talk to on anoth and answer on anoth question __PUNCT__
the unit state can plai a us balanc role in asia in the decad ahead __PUNCT__ reassur all parti that no singl asian power will becom domin __PUNCT__
the u.s. __PUNCT__ japan allianc __PUNCT__ which ha been a cornerston of u. __PUNCT__ secur polici in asia for six decad __PUNCT__ serv not just japan and the us __PUNCT__ but also all of mainland asia __PUNCT__ as it assur other that the unit state __PUNCT__ not japan __PUNCT__ will plai the kei role in east asian secur __PUNCT__
as governor of new mexico __PUNCT__ i made it a prioriti to develop strong ti between my state and japan __PUNCT__
i believ the us __PUNCT__ japan allianc could provid a foundat for solv the world energi crisi and show how we can promot stabl relat in asia __PUNCT__
that why __PUNCT__ i invit the japanes govern and sever japanes compani to work with new mexico to establish a multi __PUNCT__ disciplinari research facil in our state devot to solar power __PUNCT__
the us __PUNCT__ india relationship present both great opportun and great risk __PUNCT__
handl properli __PUNCT__ thi relationship can help stabil strateg relat on the asian contin __PUNCT__ deter islamist extrem and enabl india and china to manag a joint and peac rise to prosper and power __PUNCT__
but if we mismanag thi friendship with the world largest democraci __PUNCT__ it could provok a disastr nuclear arm race in asia __PUNCT__
india can plai a us role by provid an econom counterbal to china the us can help through our own even __PUNCT__ handed __PUNCT__
we should promot greater asian represent in kei global institut __PUNCT__
india and japan should becom perman member of the un secur council and the g __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
in india __PUNCT__ pakistan __PUNCT__ afghanistan and elsewher __PUNCT__ larg muslim popul mean that polit relat will be affect for year to come by the war against jihad __PUNCT__
east and south asia muslim have been less respons to the jihadist than have arab __PUNCT__ afghan and pakistani __PUNCT__
an intellig us foreign polici can help keep it that wai __PUNCT__
thi mean address the palestinian problem __PUNCT__ get out of iraq __PUNCT__ and show the world muslim __PUNCT__ through our deed as well as through our public diplomaci __PUNCT__ that america is their friend __PUNCT__
america should spearhead a multilater marshal plan for the middl east and north africa __PUNCT__
we should invit japan __PUNCT__ china and other asian countri to join us in thi fight against poverti __PUNCT__
for a small fraction of the cost of the iraq war __PUNCT__ which ha made us so mani enemi __PUNCT__ we could make mani friend __PUNCT__
to those who sai we cannot afford an aid program to build pro __PUNCT__ american sentiment in the develop world __PUNCT__ i sai we cannot afford not to __PUNCT__
but for trade agreement to be fair __PUNCT__ environment __PUNCT__ benefici __PUNCT__ and polit __PUNCT__ sustain __PUNCT__ thei need to take account of the huge gap in level of develop around the world __PUNCT__
trade accord must have enforc mechan to insur respect for core ilo standard __PUNCT__ includ work condit __PUNCT__ minimum wage __PUNCT__ occup safeti __PUNCT__ child labor __PUNCT__ the right to collect bargain and the prohibit of compulsori and slave labor __PUNCT__
trade agreement also must incorpor environment protect __PUNCT__
the unit state should not enter into trade agreement with countri that do not sign the convent on intern trade in endang speci and the un convent to combat desertif __PUNCT__
the us also must join the kyoto protocol __PUNCT__ negoti a new global warm agreement that goe well beyond kyoto __PUNCT__ and make particip in it a condit of futur trade agreement __PUNCT__
the unit state __PUNCT__ like all countri __PUNCT__ ha the right to enforc trade agreement __PUNCT__
thi mean us the wto and u. __PUNCT__ trade remedi law to prod trade partner when thei violat their commit __PUNCT__
with respect to china __PUNCT__ the unit state ha the right to impos countervail duti on subsid export __PUNCT__ so long as we do it in a fair and reason manner and in accord with our wto commit __PUNCT__
global multilater trade talk have been the backbon of the world economi sinc wwii __PUNCT__ under gatt and now wto __PUNCT__
i hope that doha can be reviv __PUNCT__ but if doha fail __PUNCT__ we need to do our best to promot freer trade __PUNCT__ and we should consid bilater and region approach in asia __PUNCT__ so long as thei do not undermin the prospect for global progress __PUNCT__
i cannot overemphas the import of environment sustain __PUNCT__
asian growth will eventu come to a screech halt if it is base upon fossil fuel __PUNCT__ and other unsustain technolog __PUNCT__
essenti resourc like water also cannot bear the brunt of rapid asian growth us __NUM__ centuri technolog __PUNCT__
if china __PUNCT__ india and the unit state continu to increas coal __PUNCT__ gener electr without cleaner technolog __PUNCT__ thei could produc as much as an extra __NUM__ billion ton of co2 by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi would dwarf all the co2 reduct call for by all signatori to the kyoto protocol __PUNCT__
such a catastroph can be prevent if the unit state take the lead with other develop countri in advanc altern technolog __PUNCT__ and partner with develop asia to construct __PUNCT__ rapidli __PUNCT__ a sustain develop model __PUNCT__
if i were presid __PUNCT__ i would conven an asia energi summit with china __PUNCT__ india __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ the world bank __PUNCT__ the asian develop bank __PUNCT__ and the unit nation environ program __PUNCT__ to adopt a ten __PUNCT__ year strategi for a major energi transit in asia __PUNCT__
the stake could not be higher __PUNCT__
we must implement altern technolog __PUNCT__ on a global scale __PUNCT__ as if our live depend on it __PUNCT__ becaus thei do __PUNCT__
the mani econom __PUNCT__ environment and geo __PUNCT__ strateg issu i have discuss todai ar __PUNCT__ of cours interrel in complex wai __PUNCT__
a world less depend on fossil fuel __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ would be less prone to conflict over fossil fuel __PUNCT__
a world with fewer carbon emiss would be a world less subject to terribl climact event __PUNCT__ such as flood of low __PUNCT__ ly countri like bangladesh __PUNCT__
a world of free and fair trade would be a world less prone to financi imbal and to war and conflict __PUNCT__
perhap most fundament __PUNCT__ as nation work togeth to address and solv common problem __PUNCT__ thei develop the skill and the trust to address and solv other common problem __PUNCT__
the unit state ha a kei role to plai in the come year in forg the partnership and reform intern institut __PUNCT__ so that china __PUNCT__ india and other emerg state can be brought into a new concert of great power which can address our share problem __PUNCT__
it is up to all of us to work togeth to achiev a stabl __PUNCT__ multi __PUNCT__ polar asia which can meet the great challeng of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
the altern is unaccept __PUNCT__
the choic is our __PUNCT__
