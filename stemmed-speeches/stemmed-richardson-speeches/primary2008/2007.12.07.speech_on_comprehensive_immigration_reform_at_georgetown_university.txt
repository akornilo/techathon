i come here todai as a border state governor __PUNCT__ and a hispan __PUNCT__ american who know that our nation can no longer afford to ignor the issu of illeg immigr __PUNCT__
i come here as a democrat who believ my parti ha an oblig as the new major parti to pass comprehens legisl to reform our immigr law __PUNCT__
and i come here as someon who believ it time for our leader to tell the simpl truth about thi __PUNCT__ and everi other __PUNCT__ issu __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ there ar over __NUM__ million illeg immigr in the unit state __PUNCT__
most ar law abid __PUNCT__ except for the fact that thei have enter thi countri illeg __PUNCT__
and almost all have come here to work __PUNCT__ to build a better life for themselv and their famili __PUNCT__ just as previou gener of immigr have done __PUNCT__
eleven million peopl live in the shadow is a huge problem __PUNCT__ and we need to address it intellig and thoughtfulli __PUNCT__ and urgent __PUNCT__
if congress fail to do so __PUNCT__ it will onli get wors __PUNCT__ and the demagogueri about it which we have heard so much of recent will onli get louder __PUNCT__
as the california __PUNCT__ born son of an american father and a mexican mother __PUNCT__ i have known immigr all my life and i know why thei come to america __PUNCT__
and as governor of new mexico i have known the problem of illeg immigr all too well __PUNCT__ we live with thi issu everi dai in my state __PUNCT__
like it or not __PUNCT__ these peopl have becom part of the fabric of our economi and our cultur __PUNCT__
thei have broken the law to enter our countri __PUNCT__ but thei ar here __PUNCT__ there ar million of them build and clean our home and offic __PUNCT__ pick and cook our food __PUNCT__ care for our children __PUNCT__
these men and women ar here illeg __PUNCT__ but thei work hard __PUNCT__ pai tax __PUNCT__ and contribut to the commun thei live in __PUNCT__
america need to solv thi problem __PUNCT__ not tear itself apart over it __PUNCT__
i believ the american peopl ar better than the demagogu think we ar __PUNCT__ and that the voter prove it on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
the most extrem candid lost across the countri __PUNCT__
seventi percent of hispan citizen vote democrat __PUNCT__ and most non __PUNCT__ hispan also reject the divis polit of the anti __PUNCT__ immigr extremist __PUNCT__
i hope that the republican right __PUNCT__ wing learn it lesson and that sensibl senat and congressmen from both parti can now come togeth and address thi real problem with real solut __PUNCT__
i also hope that presid bush __PUNCT__ whose rhetor ha been moder on thi issu __PUNCT__ will now step up and lead a bipartisan comprehens reform effort __PUNCT__
think for a moment about the qualiti of life for an undocu worker __PUNCT__
no protect from unscrupul employ __PUNCT__
no job benefit __PUNCT__
no health care __PUNCT__ no pension __PUNCT__ no social secur __PUNCT__ no worker compens __PUNCT__ no medicar or disabl insur __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ despit what some peopl would have you think __PUNCT__ almost all of these worker pai tax __PUNCT__ includ social secur and medicar tax __PUNCT__
becaus in order to find work thei must either us someon els social secur number or make on up __PUNCT__
sinc thei will never collect benefit __PUNCT__ these illeg worker ar subsid our social secur and medicar trust fund with their payrol tax __PUNCT__
and those who ar not pai into social secur and medicar ar work under the tabl __PUNCT__ and ar at even greater risk of be exploit __PUNCT__
no minimum wage __PUNCT__ no safeti standard __PUNCT__ no over __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ no protect against sexual harass or even sexual abus __PUNCT__
mani worker chang job everi few month becaus their employ find out that their social secur number is invalid or belong to someon els __PUNCT__
most undocu immigr come to the unit state to work low __PUNCT__ wage job which few american want __PUNCT__ such as pick crop or clean toilet __PUNCT__
our economi creat demand for at least __NUM__ new low __PUNCT__ skill illeg immigr per year __PUNCT__ but onli about __NUM__ ar allow to enter legal __PUNCT__
when demand and legal suppli ar so out of line __PUNCT__ the pressur for illeg immigr ar enorm __PUNCT__
and let not forget what kind of live the vast major of illeg immigr were live in their home countri __PUNCT__ what propel them to come here in the first place __PUNCT__
econom opportun and upward mobil in mexico and central american countri ar limit __PUNCT__ and half of all mexican live in poverti and a fifth live in extrem poverti __PUNCT__
when there ar hundr of thousand of rel good pai new job avail everi year a few hundr mile to the north the result is complet predict __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we ar talk about peopl who knowingli have broken the law __PUNCT__
and thei should be held account __PUNCT__ like all lawbreak __PUNCT__
but we also ar talk about peopl who ar econom refuge __PUNCT__ and who contribut significantli to america econom success and to the econom and polit stabil of their home countri __PUNCT__ with the billion in remitt thei send home to their famili everi year __PUNCT__
if we go to tell the truth we admit that entir sector of our economi reli on these labor __PUNCT__ construct __PUNCT__ restaur __PUNCT__ and agricultur __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__
without them __PUNCT__ mani american busi simpli could not continu to function __PUNCT__
by some estim __PUNCT__ undocu worker account for fulli __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our nation economi __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million lawbreak is a daunt number __PUNCT__ and more arriv everi dai __PUNCT__
such widespread disregard for the law is corros of our civic cultur __PUNCT__ and must not be allow to continu __PUNCT__
a nation of law cannot allow million of undocu immigr to live in the shadow and hundr of thousand more to enter the countri illeg everi year __PUNCT__
for decad politician have pass law on immigr with a wink and a nudg __PUNCT__ with no intent of follow through and make sure those law were enforc __PUNCT__
for far too long __PUNCT__ the immigr debat ha been about elector polit __PUNCT__ not about polici __PUNCT__
we need more honest leadership than that __PUNCT__
we need to stop exploit the immigr problem __PUNCT__ and start solv it __PUNCT__
we need to pass realist law and then enforc them rigor __PUNCT__
despit the campaign rhetor __PUNCT__ i refus to believ that most hous republican realli favor try to round up __NUM__ million peopl __PUNCT__ separ them from their children who ar citizen __PUNCT__ and deport them en mass __PUNCT__
but that what the bill thei pass in the hous of repres on __DATE__ would requir __PUNCT__
american don't want that and i believ the result of the __NUM__ elect prove it __PUNCT__
onli in a few race for local offic in commun that have been dramat transform in recent year by illeg immigr wa anybodi defeat for public offic becaus thei support a moder approach to the problem __PUNCT__
certainli no congression or gubernatori candid wa defeat for that reason __PUNCT__
i got almost __NUM__ percent of the vote for governor thi year in new mexico __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent more than in __NUM__ when i wa first elect __PUNCT__ and new mexico is a swing state __PUNCT__
thi is after i implement a polici to grant driver licens without regard to legal resid __PUNCT__
as a result of thi polici we got the percentag of uninsur driver down from __NUM__ percent to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
new mexican want our road to be safe and the driver who rear __PUNCT__ end them to be insur __PUNCT__
we want our highwai cop to focu on catch drunk driver __PUNCT__ not illeg immigr __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha fail to deal with illeg immigr __PUNCT__ forc state governor to deal with the consequ of thi failur __PUNCT__
governor must promot public safeti and ensur that all resid of the state __PUNCT__ welcom or unwelcom __PUNCT__ legal here or not __PUNCT__ ar product __PUNCT__ self __PUNCT__ support __PUNCT__ and law abid contributor to our commun __PUNCT__
but treat illeg immigr like human be won't make the problem go awai __PUNCT__
we also need to face up to the problem __PUNCT__ and that begin with better border secur __PUNCT__
last year i declar a state of emerg along our border with mexico becaus the situat there had gotten out of hand __PUNCT__
nobodi wa address the issu in washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ and crime __PUNCT__ drug and lawless were out of control __PUNCT__
i also wa the first governor to meet presid bush request to send nation guard troop to the border __PUNCT__ becaus the situat is a nation secur concern as well __PUNCT__
al qaeda took decad to find a wai to hit america hard and terrorist ar still out there __PUNCT__ probe __PUNCT__ plot __PUNCT__ and prepar for their next attack __PUNCT__
i know that full well from my diplomat experi __PUNCT__
if there a wai for them to get into thi countri and attack us again thei will find it __PUNCT__
we need to stop them __PUNCT__ and border secur is essenti to do so __PUNCT__
i believ in recogn the realiti of the immigr problem and address it head __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__
i reject both the cheap rhetor we heard in thi year campaign __PUNCT__ and i reject the fear of some democrat that take action will caus our parti polit harm __PUNCT__
we should seek a bipartisan solut to the problem of illeg immigr __PUNCT__ and i believ such a solut is at hand __PUNCT__
we have a uniqu opportun to deal with thi issu in __NUM__ and if we let it pass we might not get anoth opportun for year to come __PUNCT__
illeg immigr ha doubl in the past ten year and if it is not address it could doubl again in the next ten year __PUNCT__
think of the demagogueri we will hear then __PUNCT__ so i am call on the democrat congress to act swiftli to work with the presid and solv thi problem __PUNCT__
and it can be solv by take four realist step __PUNCT__ secur the border __PUNCT__ increas legal immigr __PUNCT__ prevent employ from hire illeg worker __PUNCT__ and provid a path to legal for most of the __NUM__ million illeg immigr alreadi here __PUNCT__
secur the border must come first __PUNCT__ but we must understand that build a fenc will not in ani wai accomplish that object __PUNCT__
no fenc ever built ha stop histori and thi on wouldn't either __PUNCT__
the congress should abandon the fenc __PUNCT__ lock __PUNCT__ stock __PUNCT__ and barrel __PUNCT__
it fli in the face of america as a symbol of freedom __PUNCT__
thi is what we should do __PUNCT__ immedi put enough nation guard troop at the border to keep it cover until we can secur it with border patrol offic __PUNCT__
that should take no longer than three year __PUNCT__
if it take anoth year __PUNCT__ let do it __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we must hire and train enough border guard to actual cover the entir border __PUNCT__
i have spent a lot of time at the border and i know we cannot secur it with a fenc __PUNCT__ but we can secur it with enough train border patrol offic __PUNCT__
i propos doubl the number of border patrol agent from approxim __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thousand to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thousand __PUNCT__
that would secur the border __PUNCT__
and you could more than pai for it with the fund for the first segment of that ill __PUNCT__ advis fenc between __PUNCT__ mexico and the unit state __PUNCT__
real secur __PUNCT__ real result __PUNCT__ at a fraction of the financi or polit cost __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we should give the border patrol the benefit of the best surveil equip avail to our militari __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as suggest by texa congresswoman sheila jackson lee __PUNCT__ a leader on immigr issu __PUNCT__ we should implement a system of __PUNCT__ inform visa __PUNCT__ and cash reward for alien who provid law enforc with inform on human traffick and document forger __PUNCT__
we should establish a __PUNCT__ fraudul document task forc __PUNCT__ to constantli updat law enforc and border offici on the latest fraudul document be market for entri into the unit state __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we have to work close with the mexican govern __PUNCT__
illeg immigr is __PUNCT__ at it root __PUNCT__ primarili an econom problem __PUNCT__ mexican need job and incom __PUNCT__ and mexico benefit greatli from illeg immigr to the unit state __PUNCT__
it is a safeti valv for their unemploi __PUNCT__ and a major sourc of revenu in their economi __PUNCT__ from the monei illeg worker here send home __PUNCT__
under present condit __PUNCT__ the mexican just don't have enough incent to give us the help we need at the border __PUNCT__
mexico need to do more to stem the flow __PUNCT__
but if we creat a reason guest worker program and provid a path to legal for illeg immigr alreadi here __PUNCT__ as i will discuss in a moment __PUNCT__ there is everi reason to expect mexico to do it part to creat more job in mexico and to help us with border secur __PUNCT__
the mexican __PUNCT__ after all __PUNCT__ also suffer great harm from the lawless at the border __PUNCT__ from drug smuggl and the simpl miseri of peopl try again and again to get into the unit state illeg __PUNCT__
but don't expect the mexican govern to do anyth if we go to talk about build a berlin __PUNCT__ style wall and deport million of latino __PUNCT__
two week ago i met with mexican presid calderon and he told me he is will to do work with us to stop illeg immigr __PUNCT__ if the unit state is will to address the crisi honestli and realist along with him __PUNCT__
if we refrain from build the fenc __PUNCT__ which __PUNCT__ as i have said __PUNCT__ is a wast of monei anywai __PUNCT__ i believ that the mexican would to step in with real effort to help us patrol the border more effect __PUNCT__
we need to build a special relationship with our neighbor to the south __PUNCT__ so that we can jointli patrol the border __PUNCT__ and work togeth on creat more job for mexican at home in mexico __PUNCT__
presid bush need to address thi issu with mexico aggress and realist __PUNCT__
he need to us hi last two year to turn presid calderon good intent into good effort __PUNCT__
on of the reason for my meet with presid calderon wa to pitch a plan to develop border infrastructur to move good through the free __PUNCT__ trade zone along the border __PUNCT__ revit commun on both side of the border and creat much __PUNCT__ need job __PUNCT__
thi kind of action take face __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ face diplomaci __PUNCT__ someth thi countri ha been far too reluct to engag in late __PUNCT__
i believ mani problem can be solv by face them head __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ face __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ face __PUNCT__
my entir career ha been base larg on that principl __PUNCT__
earlier todai __PUNCT__ i wa veri proud to stand with secretari gener insulza of the organ of american state __PUNCT__ who ha appoint me as a special envoi to the oa for hemispher relat __PUNCT__
i will work on special assign in latin america at the request of the secretari __PUNCT__ with a special focu on econom develop and immigr __PUNCT__
it would be my goal to demonstr to oa member state that thei have an equal respons to solv the immigr problem __PUNCT__ and work togeth on mani import issu __PUNCT__
onc the border is secur we must make it possibl for employ to meet legal their unskil labor need __PUNCT__
rais the minimum wage to __MONEY__ dollar an hour will motiv more american to fill some of these job __PUNCT__ but most low __PUNCT__ wage job will still need to be fill by immigr __PUNCT__ becaus there simpli ar not enough american who want them __PUNCT__
if the us economi need these worker __PUNCT__ it is in our nation interest to let more of them come legal __PUNCT__ by increas combin legal quota for temporari and perman taxpai immigr to __NUM__ worker per year __PUNCT__
to keep famili togeth __PUNCT__ we also should doubl the number of famili member visa __PUNCT__ from __NUM__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we also need to improv the effici and transpar of our legal immigr machineri __PUNCT__ which is plagu by long delai and huge backlog __PUNCT__
we need clearer procedur and more rapid and effici process of immigr petit __PUNCT__ so that fewer peopl will seek to evad the legal process __PUNCT__ and more can be admit legal __PUNCT__
the mccain __PUNCT__ kennedi legisl pass by the senat thi year provid an excel framework for a guest worker program __PUNCT__ pai an applic fee __PUNCT__ undergo a medic examin and a background check __PUNCT__ the initi work period would be three year and it could be extend for up to three more year __PUNCT__ if you out of work for more than __NUM__ dai you must return to your home countri or last countri of resid __PUNCT__ you can chang employ __PUNCT__ but if you break the law you must leav __PUNCT__
those ar realist and sustain requir __PUNCT__
the number of guest worker allow at ani on time must be base upon the need of the us economi __PUNCT__
the goal must be to meet demand for job that go unfil by american citizen __PUNCT__ and no more __PUNCT__
increas the minimum wage will help __PUNCT__ but we must make certain that no american lose a job becaus of a guest worker program __PUNCT__
enforc of our minimum wage law also must improv __PUNCT__ ani employ who pai less than the minimum wage to ani worker must face both high fine and a high probabl of get caught __PUNCT__
we also must expand employ __PUNCT__ train for low __PUNCT__ wage american worker __PUNCT__
we also need a nation system to reliabl and instantan verifi the legal statu of everi job applic and worker __PUNCT__
we cannot stop illeg immigr if we continu to look the other wai on illeg employ __PUNCT__
we need a nation __PUNCT__ non __PUNCT__ duplic electron worker identif document to be us exclus for employ purpos __PUNCT__
such a system must come with legal protect against it be us to discrimin in hire practic __PUNCT__ as well as privaci safeguard __PUNCT__
after the institut of such an id system __PUNCT__ employ will have no excus __PUNCT__ those who knowingli hire undocu worker must face seriou and certain penalti __PUNCT__
those who hire illeg immigr ar law __PUNCT__ breaker too __PUNCT__ and like illeg immigr themselv __PUNCT__ thei must be held to account for break the law __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ there is the question of the statu of the __NUM__ million illeg immigr who ar here todai __PUNCT__
the legisl pass last __DATE__ by the republican hous of repres wa a monument to demagogueri __PUNCT__
it actual propos make felon of __NUM__ million peopl and round them up for deport __PUNCT__
clearli __PUNCT__ thi would be imposs to do __PUNCT__
the number of illeg immigr is five time the number of inmat in all american prison combin __PUNCT__
our economi could not stand the shock of lose all these worker __PUNCT__ and our nation conscienc would not counten arrest million of men __PUNCT__ women and children __PUNCT__
we did thi to japanes american in __NUM__ and we rightfulli regret that abandon of basic american decenc __PUNCT__
so the choic is clear __PUNCT__ either we leav __NUM__ million peopl in limbo and let them be join by million more __PUNCT__ or we devis a path to earn legal __PUNCT__
you certainli can't enact a guest worker program without deal with the million alreadi here __PUNCT__ and the econom realiti is that the demand for worker will be met with immigr on wai or anoth __PUNCT__
provid a path to earn legal is not amnesti __PUNCT__ albeit some will call it that __PUNCT__
let them __PUNCT__ fear monger spent hundr of million of dollar try to call it amnesti __PUNCT__ and the american peopl saw through it __PUNCT__
poll show that larg major of american favor provid illeg immigr a path to legal __PUNCT__
still __PUNCT__ the path to legal should recogn that law have been broken __PUNCT__
the presenc of most of them benefit thi countri __PUNCT__ but there must be account __PUNCT__
almost all illeg worker pai into the social secur and medicar trust fund __PUNCT__
by legal them __PUNCT__ thei all will __PUNCT__
and to be legal __PUNCT__ thei should be requir to pai ani other back tax thei ow __PUNCT__
thei also should pai a fine for break the law __PUNCT__
and thei must learn english and have a clean record __PUNCT__
if thei meet all of these requir __PUNCT__ we should sai __PUNCT__ welcom to america __PUNCT__
you now a legal worker __PUNCT__
just rememb __PUNCT__ you our guest and you must continu to follow these rule __PUNCT__ and those that don't will face the consequ __PUNCT__
and with instantan worker verif in place __PUNCT__ we be abl to do it __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ let me return to the subject of famili __PUNCT__
our constitut state unambigu that if you ar born in the unit state you ar a citizen of thi countri and you ar guarante equal protect under all of our law __PUNCT__
it estim that more than __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of all illeg immigr have children who thu ar citizen of the unit state __PUNCT__
if we requir their parent to leav what would becom of the minor children __PUNCT__ would thei be made ward of the state somehow __PUNCT__ thei cannot be requir to leav along with their parent __PUNCT__
thi is on of the reason why i believ the legisl wa pass in the hous without ani intent of it ever becom law __PUNCT__ which is transpar dishonest leadership __PUNCT__
and i believ the propon of immigr reform have noth to fear from those who have resort to such tactic __PUNCT__
the voter ar fed up with that kind of polit and thei ar fed up with the failur to address press problem like illeg immigr __PUNCT__
most democrat in the hous of repres vote against the republican bill to crimin illeg immigr and democrat ar now in charg of the hous __PUNCT__
a bipartisan major in the senat pass the mccain __PUNCT__ kennedi bill __PUNCT__
that major grew larger on elect dai __PUNCT__
and presid bush support a guest worker program and a path to legal __PUNCT__
the new polit lineup in washington mean that congress ha the number to pass a comprehens immigr reform law next year which the presid will sign __PUNCT__
we have a histor opportun to solv a problem that is tear our countri apart __PUNCT__
we must not miss thi chanc __PUNCT__
the democrat agenda for the next congress is an excel on __PUNCT__ rais the minimum wage __PUNCT__ get lobbyist out of the busi of write legisl __PUNCT__ allow medicar to negoti for the lowest possibl prescript drug legisl __PUNCT__ enact all of the 9/11 commiss recommend __PUNCT__ and chang the cours of our iraq polici __PUNCT__
immigr reform must be ad to the top of that list __PUNCT__
the democrat won the elect and the price of leadership is do what right for america __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
