thei then agre to take awai that withdraw languag and pass the monei without it present in the bill __PUNCT__
should the democrat leadership have done that __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i believ the democrat in congress miss a great opportun __PUNCT__
what is not work __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ becaus the american peopl want us to get out of iraq __PUNCT__ and we must becaus it hurt our nation interest __PUNCT__
what the democrat have been do in my judgment is focus on the wrong initi __PUNCT__ and that is more fund cut __PUNCT__ more timet __PUNCT__
what i would propos is a deauthor resolut __PUNCT__ under the war power act __PUNCT__ articl i __PUNCT__ that basic allow the congress to determin whether we at war at not __PUNCT__
and what ha happen now is __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ is that the first resolut that wa vote on sever year ago is not oper anymor __PUNCT__
sadaam hussein is out __PUNCT__ there ar no weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ the american peopl ar total against thi war __PUNCT__
i believ a deauthor resolut would pass __PUNCT__
under articl i __PUNCT__ the presid wouldn't veto it __PUNCT__
but i do believ that the congress miss __PUNCT__ miss a __PUNCT__ miss an opportun __PUNCT__
we must get out of iraq __PUNCT__
the american peopl __PUNCT__ everywher i go __PUNCT__ not just in the earli primari state __PUNCT__ want an exit strategi __PUNCT__

we must see thi mission through __PUNCT__
we mustn't stai in iraq past the point where the new govern ask us to leav __PUNCT__ but neither can we unilater pull out befor the iraqi have achiev control over their own intern secur __PUNCT__
we ow them the opportun to make their democraci work __PUNCT__
we must not undermin their effort now __PUNCT__
that exactli what you do __PUNCT__ undermin their effort __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ i know thi region well __PUNCT__

i regret not have push more diplomat earli on with presid bush __PUNCT__

we ar view __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ so __PUNCT__ but then __PUNCT__ though __PUNCT__ to be sure __PUNCT__ that total contrari to what you wrote in your book __PUNCT__
so you now __PUNCT__ in effect __PUNCT__ sai what you wrote in the book is no longer oper __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ like everybodi els __PUNCT__ when we went into iraq __PUNCT__ i want to support the troop __PUNCT__
but after incompet __PUNCT__ deceit by thi administr __PUNCT__ the fact that there no weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ the link to al __PUNCT__ qaeda wa enorm suspect __PUNCT__ what we now have is __NUM__ percent of the iraqi peopl feel it ok to shoot an american soldier __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent sunni __PUNCT__ shia want us out of iraq __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ there is no basi for us to be there __PUNCT__
what we need to do is disengag our troop but set up a diplomat effort __PUNCT__ three __PUNCT__ prong __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ a reconcili of all the three religi and ethnic group in iraq __PUNCT__ the sunni __PUNCT__ the shia and the kurd __PUNCT__ for a divis of power __PUNCT__ coalit govern __PUNCT__ divid up oil revenu __PUNCT__ a date and type separ of three entiti __PUNCT__ an all __PUNCT__ muslim peacekeep forc that i believ could provid secur for iraq __PUNCT__ along with the iraqi __PUNCT__ and then a donor confer to deal with reconstruct __PUNCT__
our troop have done a magnific job __PUNCT__ but now thei have becom target __PUNCT__
now it up to the iraqi to take over __PUNCT__
and you know __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ the iraqi ar not necessarili todai helpless __PUNCT__
thei have __NUM__ secur forc __PUNCT__ thei have __MONEY__ billion in oil reserv __PUNCT__ thei had three elect __PUNCT__ so thei have __PUNCT__ thei have a constitut __PUNCT__ thei have democrat institut __PUNCT__
it is time for them to take over __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but there onli __NUM__ iraqi troop that can stand alon and oper independ of u. __PUNCT__ forc __PUNCT__

on of the problem __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is the maliki govern is not step up to the plate in two kei area __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ nation reconcili between the sunni and the shia __PUNCT__ and then secondli __PUNCT__ in term of train their own troop __PUNCT__ thei slow __PUNCT__ there bureaucraci __PUNCT__
perhap thei don't have the polit will __PUNCT__
i believ that our obsess with iraq __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ ha cost us enorm __PUNCT__
not just prestig around the world __PUNCT__ but also in focus on the major threat of thi countri __PUNCT__ which ar intern terror __PUNCT__ nuclear terror __PUNCT__ build an intern coalit __PUNCT__ nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ a loos nuclear weapon in the hand of rogu nation __PUNCT__ global climat chang __PUNCT__

i believ what is need is a region approach that also deal with the isra __PUNCT__ palestinian issu __PUNCT__ that also deal with talk to iran and syria as part of a solut __PUNCT__ of veri tough negoti with those two countri __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the new york time todai __PUNCT__ front page lead stori __PUNCT__ talk to __NUM__ iraqi politician __PUNCT__ citizen __PUNCT__ consult other expert in the field __PUNCT__ and not a on believ that an immedi withdraw is viabl __PUNCT__
gener anthoni zinni __PUNCT__ former head of u. __PUNCT__ central command __PUNCT__ who oppos the war __PUNCT__ said it go to take five to seven year for that area to stabil __PUNCT__
do you realli believ that an immedi withdraw of all u. __PUNCT__ troop would not lead to complet chao in iraq and the region __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ there is chao now __PUNCT__
there civil war __PUNCT__ there sectarian conflict __PUNCT__
look at the __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ and it wouldn't wors __PUNCT__ it wouldn't worsen __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ look at the __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if u. __PUNCT__ troop left __PUNCT__ would it worsen __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
becaus our troop ar the target __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ you cannot start reconcili __PUNCT__ you cannot start unifi the region and protect our interest until everyon believ that the american militari presenc is __PUNCT__ is go to go __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i for secur our embassi __PUNCT__ obvious __PUNCT__ with __PUNCT__ with marin personnel __PUNCT__
but i do believ __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ that what is critic import now is a diplomat effort __PUNCT__ a region effort __PUNCT__
it call talk to your enemi __PUNCT__
like yitzhak rabin said __PUNCT__ you don't make peac with your friend __PUNCT__ you make peac with your enemi __PUNCT__
it mean talk to iran __PUNCT__ it mean talk to syria __PUNCT__ get an all __PUNCT__ muslim peacekeep forc __PUNCT__ turkei __PUNCT__ jordan __PUNCT__ saudi arabia __PUNCT__ to be part of an all __PUNCT__ muslim effort that secur iraq __PUNCT__
and then the iraqi have to step up and do it __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ if iraq complet destabil __PUNCT__ if you withdraw __PUNCT__ withdrew troop __PUNCT__ would you be will to consid send troop back in to stabil it __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ what i would do __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is i would have troop where thei want __PUNCT__ in kuwait __PUNCT__
we have base there __PUNCT__ in bahrain __PUNCT__
i would have a conting in case of an intern terrorist attack __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ qaeda is our enemi __PUNCT__
our involv in iraq ha led us to fail to focu on the true threat __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ qaeda in afghanistan __PUNCT__ in the region __PUNCT__
nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__ a loos piec of plutonium or uranium that is transport into some of our __PUNCT__ some of our citi __PUNCT__
the fact that we don't have a viabl homeland secur polici in thi countri to protect our port __PUNCT__ our aircraft __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ but again __PUNCT__ again __PUNCT__ if the situat in iraq deterior and further destabil __PUNCT__ all __PUNCT__ out civil war spill over into surround countri __PUNCT__ would you consid send troop back in to stabil __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ a presid would never preclud a militari option __PUNCT__
but i would be readi to provid the iraqi with air power __PUNCT__ special forc protect __PUNCT__
there would be troop in the region that __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ that would be avail for ani contig __PUNCT__
but the problem now __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is our presenc ha caus what i believ is a civil war __PUNCT__ a sectarian conflict __PUNCT__
and the best polici right now that protect our interest is for us to disengag __PUNCT__
and i would do it by the end of thi calendar year __PUNCT__
let the militari decid that __PUNCT__
but if you leav residu troop __PUNCT__ and that is the differ between my posit and all the other candid __PUNCT__ that our residu troop __PUNCT__ what is it __PUNCT__ __NUM__ out of the __NUM__ that ar there __PUNCT__ that is a signific portion __PUNCT__
the iraqi should be in charg of secur and protect our embassi and our personnel that stai there __PUNCT__

russert __PUNCT__ let me turn to immigr __PUNCT__
last week thi is what all the newspap said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the senat compromis immigr bill is forc the presidenti candid to confront a divis issu __PUNCT__
new mexico governor bill richardson prais the bill __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ thi legisl make a good start __PUNCT__ toward __PUNCT__ re __PUNCT__ secur our southern border __PUNCT__
a few dai later thi headlin appear __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ hispan presidenti hope confront immigr debat __PUNCT__
on wednesdai richardson said that after readi the immigr bill in detail __PUNCT__ he decid to oppos it __PUNCT__ sai the measur place too great a burden on immigr __PUNCT__ tear apart famili that want to settl in the u. __PUNCT__ creat a perman tier of second __PUNCT__ class immigr worker and financ a border fenc __PUNCT__
thi is fundament flaw in it current form and i would oppos it __PUNCT__
we need bipartisanship __PUNCT__ we also need legisl that compassion __PUNCT__
i not sure thi is it __PUNCT__
how can you be for it and __NUM__ hour later against it __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ thi is what happen __PUNCT__
i wa announc for presid __PUNCT__ and the dai befor __PUNCT__ i saw a summari of a bill that had been propos in the senat __PUNCT__
and the summari __PUNCT__ i believ __PUNCT__ contain essenti element of a comprehens immigr reform bill __PUNCT__
on __PUNCT__ that there be tougher border secur __PUNCT__ doubl of border patrol agent __PUNCT__
that good __PUNCT__
and two __PUNCT__ a legal program for the __NUM__ million that ar here __PUNCT__
three __PUNCT__ it also contain penalti for employ that knowingli hire illeg worker __PUNCT__
i thought that wa all good __PUNCT__
the bill is then present __PUNCT__ and i read it the next dai __PUNCT__ and it contain some problem __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i prais the congress and the presid for __PUNCT__ in a bipartisan wai __PUNCT__ put someth forward that is a good start __PUNCT__
but the problem __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ i deal with thi issu everi dai __PUNCT__
i a border governor __PUNCT__
two year ago __PUNCT__ i declar a border emerg in new mexico becaus the flow of peopl and drug were harm new mexico __PUNCT__
so i have strong qualif on thi issu __PUNCT__
i been deal it __PUNCT__ with it for year __PUNCT__
the problem with the immigr bill __PUNCT__ the wai i read it now __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is on __PUNCT__ it separ famili __PUNCT__
it give __PUNCT__ it give too much credenc to job skill rather than famili __PUNCT__
the essenc of all our immigr law have been to preserv famili __PUNCT__ and thi separ famili __PUNCT__
secondli __PUNCT__ a guest worker program __PUNCT__
the guest worker program __PUNCT__ first post __PUNCT__ should be to protect american worker to have the __PUNCT__ the top job __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ to have the job and not the guest worker __PUNCT__
there ar no labor protect for those guest worker __PUNCT__
and then third __PUNCT__ what i also saw in the bill that wa not report in the summari is that it good to have more border guard __PUNCT__ and we have to doubl them __PUNCT__ and there been a problem becaus the feder govern ha not train enough to make that happen __PUNCT__
but the fenc __PUNCT__ the fenc __PUNCT__ the wall between mexico and the unit state __PUNCT__ there more fund for it __PUNCT__
thi wall is wrong __PUNCT__
thi wall is a terribl symbol between two countri that ar friend __PUNCT__
and you go to have a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ foot wall __PUNCT__ and what go to happen is there go to be __NUM__ __PUNCT__ foot ladder go over that wall construct __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ the wall hasn't work __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it hasn't work __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ anywher along the border __PUNCT__ the fenc hasn't work __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ it hasn't work __PUNCT__
what ha work is more border patrol __PUNCT__
what ha work is some nation guardsmen __PUNCT__
what ha work is some technolog __PUNCT__
it made the program better __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ we got to talk to mexico __PUNCT__ our friend __PUNCT__ get them to do more __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ get them to stop give max __PUNCT__ map to illeg worker on the most porou area to court __PUNCT__
and we also need to rais the legal immigr limit __PUNCT__ the backlog of worker that we need __PUNCT__ european __PUNCT__ other that __PUNCT__ indian __PUNCT__ h1b visa for job competit skill __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ i go to ask you in a second about a comment made by brian sanderoff who analyz public opinion in __PUNCT__ in new mexico __PUNCT__
but listen to you __PUNCT__ you declar a border emerg __PUNCT__ and yet you against the fenc __PUNCT__
you were for illeg immigr obtain driver licens __PUNCT__ and you were for legisl that would permit illeg immigr __PUNCT__ children to get colleg scholarship __PUNCT__
it seem as __PUNCT__ as if you on both side of the issu __PUNCT__
thi is what brian sanderoff said __PUNCT__ that bill __PUNCT__
he hard to pigeonhol as be definit anti __PUNCT__ immigr or pro __PUNCT__ immigr __PUNCT__
he go to take a middl stanc where he seem to have posit on both side of the fenc __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ i a governor __PUNCT__
i have to deal with thi issu everi dai __PUNCT__
driver licens __PUNCT__ law enforc said to me we got concern about leav the scene of a crime __PUNCT__
if you want to find a wai to keep illeg immigr __PUNCT__ you know where thei ar __PUNCT__ you give them a driver licens __PUNCT__
it help with __PUNCT__ thei all get insur __PUNCT__ it help with traffic safeti __PUNCT__
i believ educ is the kei __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__ i wa for kid of illeg immigr __PUNCT__ if thei fulfil the same academ requir as new mexico kid __PUNCT__ to be elig for a scholarship __PUNCT__
tim __PUNCT__ i believ we have to bring the __NUM__ million undocu worker out of the shadow __PUNCT__ set up a standard where thei speak english __PUNCT__ if thei pass background check __PUNCT__ pai back tax __PUNCT__ obei the law __PUNCT__ embrac american valu __PUNCT__ give them a chanc __PUNCT__ a path to citizenship __PUNCT__ not amnesti __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ that is amnesti __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it isn't amnesti __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ would you send them back __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ thei have to go back __PUNCT__ under the law __PUNCT__ to reappli __PUNCT__

you in favor of nuclear power __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ i believ it should be part of the mix __PUNCT__
i not __PUNCT__ i think the futur for american __PUNCT__ energi independ __PUNCT__ and there i believ we need an apollo program __PUNCT__
and i believ i the greenest governor in thi countri __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ what would you do with the nuclear wast __PUNCT__ richardson __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ what i would do __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ is i would __PUNCT__ technolog i think is the answer __PUNCT__
i would not put it in yucca mountain __PUNCT__ becaus when i wa secretari it wa obviou that it had environment problem __PUNCT__
it had water problem __PUNCT__ there were issu relat to transport that wast to nevada __PUNCT__
i don't believ there anoth solut that ha been advanc __PUNCT__ and that is to store some of the wast at exist site or in region site __PUNCT__
i believ the answer is technolog __PUNCT__
what i would do is get our nation laboratori to come up with a technolog solut to dispos of thi wast __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ you also sai that you would have fuel standard for automobil to __NUM__ mile per gallon in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the automobil industri __PUNCT__ standard __PUNCT__ poor __PUNCT__ ha now weigh in __PUNCT__ sai that you could __PUNCT__ that would increas the cost of a car or truck in thi countri by __MONEY__
the detroit new editori that real possibl you could bankrupt the american automobil industri with that propos __PUNCT__
richardson __PUNCT__ that wrong __PUNCT__
we must do it __PUNCT__
we must becom energi independ becaus it affect our nation secur __PUNCT__
it affect __PUNCT__ gasolin price __PUNCT__ thi morn i saw the averag around the countri __PUNCT__ __MONEY__
we must have fuel standard __PUNCT__ and i believ it realist with a __NUM__ mile __PUNCT__ per __PUNCT__ gallon flex __PUNCT__ fuel vehicl __PUNCT__ great technolog that we can develop __PUNCT__
also requir that __PUNCT__ by that same year __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ that __NUM__ percent of america electr be renew energi __PUNCT__
we have got to address global climat chang by __NUM__ a reduct of __NUM__ percent greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ mandatori cap and trade system __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ here in washington __PUNCT__ all you hear about is thi is not possibl __PUNCT__ it won't pass the congress __PUNCT__
we must do it __PUNCT__
i would lead an apollo program like john f __PUNCT__ kennedi did __PUNCT__ and i no john f __PUNCT__ kennedi __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ like when he went to the moon in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ i believ we can reduc our depend on foreign oil __PUNCT__ which is import oil __PUNCT__ which is __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that is danger __PUNCT__ countri that ar not friendli to us __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ with massiv public and privat invest in renew technolog __PUNCT__ in solar __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ biomass __PUNCT__ fuel cell __PUNCT__ distribut gener __PUNCT__ renew fuel __PUNCT__ ethanol __PUNCT__ biodiesel __PUNCT__ biofuel __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ tax incent __PUNCT__ and conserv __PUNCT__

but back to your vehicl issu __PUNCT__ tim __PUNCT__
we have the technolog to have fuel effici engin __PUNCT__
we had a program at the depart of energi with the auto compani __PUNCT__ with toyota __PUNCT__ with the japanes compani __PUNCT__ to develop batteri and fuel cell and effici engin __PUNCT__ so that you can have an suv __PUNCT__ but with a fuel effici engin that somehow help us __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ what realli upset me __PUNCT__ i just saw that the bush administr onc again said to the german we not go to reduc our greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ just like the rest of the world should __PUNCT__
i would launch a major diplomat initi to sai to china and india and develop countri that america is go to be a leader in reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__ a cap and trade system that is mandatori __PUNCT__
we have to do these thing on a mandatori basi __PUNCT__
russert __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ when you left your posit as secretari of energi __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ you did join two board __PUNCT__ valero energi and diamond offshor drill __PUNCT__
valero energi __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ thei ar veri much involv in refin __PUNCT__ refin __PUNCT__
the chairman __PUNCT__ then ceo __PUNCT__ bill greehei __PUNCT__ boast that tighter suppli of gasolin __PUNCT__ had provid outstand profit margin for us __PUNCT__
