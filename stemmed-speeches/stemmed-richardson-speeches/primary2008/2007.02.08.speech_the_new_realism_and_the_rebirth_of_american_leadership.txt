thank you veri much for that kind introduct __PUNCT__
in recent year __PUNCT__ america foreign polici ha been guid more by dogma than by fact __PUNCT__ more by ideolog than by histori __PUNCT__
more by wish think than by realiti __PUNCT__
thi administr lack of realism ha led us to a danger place __PUNCT__
in an era of terror __PUNCT__ thei have squander our militari power __PUNCT__ undermin our diplomat leverag __PUNCT__ and deplet our treasuri __PUNCT__
thei have embolden our enemi and isol us from our friend __PUNCT__
thei have confus our moral compass and compromis our nation secur __PUNCT__
we need to take a differ path __PUNCT__
a path base on realiti __PUNCT__ not unilateralist illus __PUNCT__
a path that understand that the gravest danger that threaten us todai do not threaten onli us __PUNCT__ and that therefor to pursu our nation interest and meet these challeng we must work with our friend __PUNCT__ our enemi __PUNCT__ and everyon in between __PUNCT__
thi is a path not of hard word __PUNCT__ but of hard work __PUNCT__
a path of moral strength __PUNCT__ not piou judgment __PUNCT__
a path of strong diplomaci __PUNCT__ back up by a strong militari and strong allianc __PUNCT__
thi is the path of american leadership __PUNCT__
a path that i believ can lead to an axi of reason to confront urgent global problem __PUNCT__
presid bush doesn't seem to understand that success in foreign polici requir both a strong militari and smart diplomaci __PUNCT__
becaus while diplomaci without power is weak __PUNCT__ power without diplomaci is blind __PUNCT__
befor i becam governor __PUNCT__ i had been a congressman __PUNCT__ america ambassador to the unit nation __PUNCT__ and secretari of energi __PUNCT__
over the past __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ i also have led mani diplomat mission where i have stood toe __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ toe with some of the world toughest custom __PUNCT__ includ saddam __PUNCT__ castro __PUNCT__ the north korean __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ most recent __PUNCT__ the sudanes leader bashir __PUNCT__
i have gotten all these tough gui to do what i want them to do becaus i put my disdain for them asid __PUNCT__ and talk to them __PUNCT__
you need to know your enemi if you want him to cooper __PUNCT__
i know that even bad gui will listen to you when you hold a big stick in on hand and a carrot in the other __PUNCT__ and you show them a face __PUNCT__ save wai out of the dilemma you have just creat for them __PUNCT__
talk to peopl is no guarante of success __PUNCT__ but refus to talk to them is usual a precursor to failur __PUNCT__
as jfk said __PUNCT__ we should never negoti out of fear __PUNCT__ but we should never fear to negoti __PUNCT__
i also have work close with some extraordinari leader __PUNCT__ such as bill clinton __PUNCT__ kofi annan and nelson mandela __PUNCT__
i know that great leader ar guid by shine ideal __PUNCT__ but that thei ar never blind by ideolog __PUNCT__
thei know that to pursu a vision to make the world a better place __PUNCT__ you first must see the world as it realli is __PUNCT__
to restor american leadership __PUNCT__ we need to reject dogma __PUNCT__ and to embrac a new realism in our foreign polici __PUNCT__
an enlighten and ethic realism for the __NUM__ st centuri __PUNCT__
a realism that look at the world through cool ey __PUNCT__ but that is also inspir by ardent principl __PUNCT__
the new realism america is a great nation that know how to defend itself __PUNCT__
we ar also a nation that ha been will to pai in blood as well as in coin for what we believ is the right thing to do and we have a sens that in order to do right by ourselv __PUNCT__ we must be readi to do right by other __PUNCT__
we defend ourselv most effect when we lead other __PUNCT__
and it ha been our willing to seek and find common ground __PUNCT__ to blend our interest with those of other __PUNCT__ which ha been the kei to our long histori of effect leadership __PUNCT__
realist like truman and eisenhow understood that defend europ and ourselv from the soviet requir a strong militari __PUNCT__
but thei also understood that we could not lead our alli if thei did not wish to follow __PUNCT__
these and subsequ american presid knew the import of moral leadership __PUNCT__
our remark militari and our prosper economi gave us the power to lead __PUNCT__
but our commit to human digniti __PUNCT__ includ our willing to struggl against our own prejudic __PUNCT__ inspir other to follow __PUNCT__
if america is to lead again __PUNCT__ we need to rememb thi histori __PUNCT__ and to rebuild our overextend militari __PUNCT__ increas the size of our armi __PUNCT__ reviv our allianc __PUNCT__ and restor our reput as a nation which respect intern law __PUNCT__ human right and civil liberti __PUNCT__
there is no time to lose __PUNCT__
for we live in peril time __PUNCT__ in which polici shape by fantasi and wish think have alreadi wreak havoc __PUNCT__ and court further disast __PUNCT__
six trend ar transform our world __PUNCT__
we need to understand them __PUNCT__ and respond to all of them simultan __PUNCT__
on trend __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ is fanat jihad burst from an increasingli unstabl and violent greater middl east __PUNCT__
thi trend had been grow for year __PUNCT__ but the invas and collaps of iraq have fuel it growth __PUNCT__
a second trend is the grow power and sophist of both non __PUNCT__ state and state __PUNCT__ link crimin and terrorist enterpris capabl of disrupt the global economi and traffick in weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__
togeth these two trend rais the terribl specter of nuclear terror __PUNCT__
we know that al qaeda ha tri to get nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we know that pakistan a.q __PUNCT__
khan sold nuclear materi to rogu state __PUNCT__ and we know that there ar former soviet nuclear weapon which ar poorli __PUNCT__ secur __PUNCT__
the exist of a black market in nuclear materi is well __PUNCT__ document __PUNCT__
the prolifer of nuclear weapon to new countri ha increas further the opportun for jihadist to obtain them __PUNCT__
a third trend transform our world is the rapid rise of asian econom and militari power __PUNCT__ abov all in china and india __PUNCT__
and a fourth trend is the re __PUNCT__ emerg of russia __PUNCT__ as an increasingli assert global and region player __PUNCT__ with a larg nuclear arsen __PUNCT__ control over energi resourc __PUNCT__ and tempt by milit nation __PUNCT__
the simultan rise of india __PUNCT__ china __PUNCT__ and russia requir our thought attent and strateg leadership __PUNCT__ so that these power nuclear __PUNCT__ arm nation mai be integr into a stabl global order __PUNCT__
a fifth trend transform our world is the simultan increas in global econom interdepend and financi imbal __PUNCT__ unaccompani by the growth of institut capac to manag these realiti __PUNCT__
global ha made our economi more vulner to resourc constraint and financi shock origin beyond our border __PUNCT__
i am particularli concern about the possibl of a global energi crisi or a collaps of the us dollar __PUNCT__
and the sixth trend we face is that of urgent and worsen health and environment problem which ar truli global in scope __PUNCT__
global warm and pandem like aid do not respect nation border __PUNCT__
and poverti __PUNCT__ ethnic conflict and overpopul also spill over border __PUNCT__ feed what mois naim ha call the __PUNCT__ five war of global __PUNCT__ over drug __PUNCT__ arm traffick __PUNCT__ monei launder __PUNCT__ intellectu properti and alien smuggl __PUNCT__
these six transform trend present us with problem which ar intern in their origin and which will requir intern solut __PUNCT__
and thei cry out for american leadership __PUNCT__
if the world succe in prevent nuclear terror __PUNCT__ defeat jihad __PUNCT__ integr rise power into a stabl order __PUNCT__ protect global financi market stabil __PUNCT__ and fight pandem and global warm __PUNCT__ america sure will deserv much of the credit __PUNCT__
if the world fail to meet these challeng __PUNCT__ america just as sure will deserv much of the blame __PUNCT__
we must confront these challeng with all our resourc __PUNCT__ from our militari to our economi to our capac to inspir other to follow us __PUNCT__
thi new realist vision for re __PUNCT__ launch american leadership in the __NUM__ st centuri will entail sever step __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ first and foremost __PUNCT__ we must repair our allianc __PUNCT__

we must be impecc in our own behavior __PUNCT__ and we must reward countri which respect the univers declar on human right __PUNCT__
and we must negoti __PUNCT__ construct but firmli __PUNCT__ with those who do not __PUNCT__
becaus we care about human right __PUNCT__ we need to start take africa serious __PUNCT__
the two most horrend recent genocid have taken place in rwanda and now darfur __PUNCT__
histori teach us that if the unit state doe not take the lead on genocid __PUNCT__ no on els will __PUNCT__
we need to step up to the plate on darfur __PUNCT__ and let the world know that when genocid threaten __PUNCT__ the unit state will lead the world to stop it __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ the unit state also must be the leader __PUNCT__ not the laggard __PUNCT__ in global effort to reduc greenhous ga emiss __PUNCT__

the futil of thi polici is most tragic obviou in regard to iran and north korea __PUNCT__ who respond to washington snub and threat with intensif of their nuclear program __PUNCT__
american leadership mean talk even with regim we don't like __PUNCT__ so that we can show them the real cost and benefit that will result from their choic __PUNCT__
sometim diplomaci demand that you talk tough __PUNCT__
but to do that __PUNCT__ you have to at least be talk __PUNCT__
we also need to engag russia and china more effect __PUNCT__ strateg __PUNCT__ and systemat than we have __PUNCT__ as we encourag them to work with us to build a stabl __PUNCT__ peac world __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ we need to focu on the real secur threat __PUNCT__ from which iraq ha so danger divert our attent __PUNCT__

we also must open an ideolog front in the war against jihad __PUNCT__
there is a civil war within islam between extremist and moder __PUNCT__ and we need to stop help our enemi in that civil war __PUNCT__
we need to start show __PUNCT__ both through our word and through our deed __PUNCT__ that thi is not __PUNCT__ as the jihadist claim __PUNCT__ a clash of civil __PUNCT__
