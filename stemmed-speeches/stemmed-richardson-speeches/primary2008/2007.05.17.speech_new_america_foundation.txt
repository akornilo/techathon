thank you __PUNCT__ ted __PUNCT__ for that introduct __PUNCT__
i appreci the opportun to speak here todai at the new america foundat __PUNCT__
i appreci your sensibl polici influenc in mani area __PUNCT__
thank to my friend terri tamminen __PUNCT__ head chef in my friend arnold schwarzenegg kitchen cabinet __PUNCT__
thank also to diana farrel and the mckinsei global institut for their excel report on energi product __PUNCT__ to be releas todai __PUNCT__
it confirm what we have been do in new mexico and the west __PUNCT__ and it support what i will discuss todai __PUNCT__
energi product is critic to meet energi demand __PUNCT__
it creat a more resili __PUNCT__ more prosper economi __PUNCT__
and for consum __PUNCT__ it save monei __PUNCT__ save energi __PUNCT__ and protect the climat __PUNCT__
the mckinsei report is a huge step forward in understand energi __PUNCT__
i want to recogn some of the other folk here as well __PUNCT__
steve howard __PUNCT__ from the climat group __PUNCT__ bring the privat sector togeth to face some of the world biggest challeng __PUNCT__
bill prindl from the american council for an energi __PUNCT__ effici economi __PUNCT__ who a great resourc on energi effici __PUNCT__
linda fisher __PUNCT__ from dupont __PUNCT__ a compani that is lead the corpor sector on sustain __PUNCT__
john stowel __PUNCT__ from duke energi __PUNCT__ among the nation leader in seek clean energi solut __PUNCT__
i am sure i miss peopl i should acknowledg __PUNCT__ but i don't have a lot of time __PUNCT__
so let me get start __PUNCT__
jefferson said someth like __PUNCT__ a littl revolut everi twenti year isn't a bad thing __PUNCT__
we have known about thi countri energi problem for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ yet our energi revolut stop in about __NUM__ when we roll back fuel economi standard __PUNCT__
sinc then our consumpt ha climb __PUNCT__ fuel effici ha stagnat __PUNCT__ and our crippl depend on foreign oil ha about doubl __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i am go to stake my claim to be the next presid __PUNCT__ the energi presid __PUNCT__ on the concept of a fast __PUNCT__ comprehens energi revolut in the unit state __PUNCT__
gasolin is back up over __MONEY__ a gallon __PUNCT__
peopl ar hurt __PUNCT__
the declin in retail sale report for __DATE__ wa among the worst ever __PUNCT__ partli becaus most american household do not have incom to spread across high gasolin cost and all the other expens of life __PUNCT__
these gasolin price increas have virtual noth to do with the arctic nation wildlif refug or the outer continent shelf __PUNCT__
thei ar not becaus oil is run out __PUNCT__ or becaus of hurrican in the gulf of mexico __PUNCT__
i am here to tell you consum ar hurt becaus u. __PUNCT__ energi market ar not divers and competit __PUNCT__ and becaus we have fed our addict to oil instead of end it __PUNCT__
we ar bleed ourselv to death __PUNCT__ bui up to __NUM__ billion dollar worth of foreign oil everi year __PUNCT__ and spend anoth __NUM__ or __NUM__ billion dollar transport and defend oil around the world __PUNCT__
the potenti for larger price spike and pain is even scarier __PUNCT__
a success terrorist attack on critic oil infrastructur __PUNCT__ for instanc __PUNCT__ could drive price up to __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ or even __MONEY__ a barrel __PUNCT__
we need a bold __PUNCT__ aggress nation energi and climat polici that help american who ar struggl to heat their home and fill their ga tank __PUNCT__ and that move us to safe __PUNCT__ avail altern as quickli as possibl __PUNCT__
that polici will recogn and benefit from the region differ that give the unit state it strength and divers __PUNCT__
these region strength __PUNCT__ from the wind and solar of my own mountain region __PUNCT__ to the biomass and coal of the midwest __PUNCT__ to the tidal forc on the coast __PUNCT__ will help the unit state meet the two great challeng of our era __PUNCT__ energi secur and global warm __PUNCT__
here ar the principl that guid my think __PUNCT__
our energi polici solut must fight global warm __PUNCT__ which threaten human __PUNCT__ ecolog __PUNCT__ and econom catastroph liter everywher on earth __PUNCT__
our energi polici solut must wean us from oil __PUNCT__ becaus ani oil addict pervert our nation strateg object __PUNCT__ limit our option __PUNCT__ and cost us both blood and treasur __PUNCT__
next __PUNCT__ in meet thi challeng __PUNCT__ we must support and help peopl __PUNCT__ commun __PUNCT__ industri __PUNCT__ and small busi who could be hurt by a careless transit __PUNCT__ but ar be terribl hurt by soar price todai __PUNCT__
further __PUNCT__ i am a market __PUNCT__ orient democrat __PUNCT__
i want to set clear regulatori standard and system and incent __PUNCT__ and allow the market to respond __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we must keep the u. __PUNCT__ at the forefront of scienc and technolog develop __PUNCT__ explor frontier __PUNCT__ find solut to our energi and climat challeng __PUNCT__
these ar my bedrock principl __PUNCT__ thei ar not subject to negoti __PUNCT__
we need a man __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ moon program to end thi addict __PUNCT__ thi hemorrhag __PUNCT__
but we need it much faster and much more boldli than peopl ar suggest __PUNCT__
when john f __PUNCT__ kennedi challeng thi countri to reach the moon __PUNCT__ he challeng us to get there in ten year __PUNCT__ not twenti __PUNCT__ or thirti __PUNCT__ or forti __PUNCT__
on energi polici __PUNCT__ we need to chang fast __PUNCT__ or sink slowli __PUNCT__
i am issu a call to action __PUNCT__ for congress __PUNCT__ the energi industri __PUNCT__ and the public __PUNCT__
i am call for a new american revolut __PUNCT__ an energi and climat revolut __PUNCT__
peopl in polit and industri might sai it can't be done __PUNCT__
my goal ar too lofti __PUNCT__
i am not compar myself to jfk __PUNCT__ but i know that when he challeng american to reach the moon in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ america respond by sai __PUNCT__ how can we help __PUNCT__ we didn't sai __PUNCT__ it can't be done __PUNCT__
i bring experi and a record of accomplish to thi challeng __PUNCT__
as governor of new mexico __PUNCT__ i have put renew energi requir in place __PUNCT__ support gener solar tax incent __PUNCT__ elimin sale tax on hybrid vehicl __PUNCT__ set aggress target to reduc global warm pollut __PUNCT__ a list of about __NUM__ import initi __PUNCT__
new mexico is now the clean energi state __PUNCT__
as energi secretari __PUNCT__ even with veri low oil price __PUNCT__ i push for aggress energi effici standard __PUNCT__ conserv in the midst of the california electr crisi __PUNCT__ a nation renew portfolio standard __PUNCT__ and develop of new vehicl technolog __PUNCT__
as a diplomat and negoti __PUNCT__ i have a record of deal successfulli with hostag __PUNCT__ taker and tyrant __PUNCT__
now i want to bring that experi to the task of free the unit state from it statu as intern hostag to costli energi __PUNCT__ and from the tyranni of oil depend __PUNCT__
i have a record __PUNCT__ i have the will __PUNCT__ and i am make thi the central prioriti for new nation polici in my campaign for presid __PUNCT__
when i take offic __PUNCT__ the congress and i will have a second __PUNCT__ first __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__ like fdr __PUNCT__ to focu on chang energi and climat polici right awai __PUNCT__
here is my five __PUNCT__ goal polici framework to break our oil addict __PUNCT__ creat competit and valu for consum __PUNCT__ strengthen our nation secur __PUNCT__ creat american job __PUNCT__ and lead the world to effect climat protect __PUNCT__
it start with goal __NUM__ a dramat reduct in oil consumpt by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the unit state consum about __NUM__ million barrel of oil per dai __PUNCT__
after katrina __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of thi wa import __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ with hard work and the cooper of congress and the american peopl __PUNCT__ we will reduc our oil depend by at least __NUM__ million barrel a dai __PUNCT__ probabl __NUM__ million __PUNCT__ and possibl as much as __NUM__ million __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we need to get low __PUNCT__ and zero __PUNCT__ petroleum plug __PUNCT__ in car into the marketplac __PUNCT__ while sharpli reduc the carbon emiss from our electr sector __PUNCT__
thi is the most import singl step we can take in chang our oil consumpt pattern for the futur __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ thi chang will reduc consumpt by around __NUM__ million barrel a dai __PUNCT__ with far larger reduct in the year after that __PUNCT__
as energi secretari __PUNCT__ i support the electr and plug __PUNCT__ in hybrid vehicl concept __PUNCT__
thei work __PUNCT__
the batteri technolog have come a long wai __PUNCT__
i am talk about two type of vehicl __PUNCT__
the pure __PUNCT__ electr vehicl offer simplic and perform for an averag daili commut in our larger metro area __PUNCT__ like the big citi on the coast and in the midwest __PUNCT__
the plug __PUNCT__ in electr car or truck provid more rang and flexibl for peopl who might drive longer distanc __PUNCT__ and it can extend ga mileag abov __NUM__ mile per gallon __PUNCT__
plug __PUNCT__ in car don't need a whole new refin and retail infrastructur __PUNCT__ like hydrogen __PUNCT__ which ha potenti for the more distant futur __PUNCT__
the infrastructur is there __PUNCT__ in your wall socket __PUNCT__
most consum will love the plug __PUNCT__ in car __PUNCT__
as a consum __PUNCT__ you choos your fuel __PUNCT__
gasolin at __NUM__ mayb __NUM__ dollar a gallon __PUNCT__ or electr __PUNCT__ cost a dollar or two for a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ mile charg __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ of __NUM__ within __NUM__ dai of take offic __PUNCT__ i will hold a two __PUNCT__ dai white hous plug __PUNCT__ in summit with automak __PUNCT__ util __PUNCT__ and labor __PUNCT__
we will lock in the program to get the __NUM__ mile per gallon car on the market across the board __PUNCT__ and to make sure we ar build clean electr to fuel it __PUNCT__
i will push thi plug __PUNCT__ in car concept with signific rebat to consum who bui them __PUNCT__ and by support automak who want to build them __PUNCT__
i expect the big three automak to lead the world in thi technolog __PUNCT__
there ar other manufactur __PUNCT__ includ an electr car manufactur compani in my own state __PUNCT__ who ar fast get into the market __PUNCT__ at detroit peril __PUNCT__
here my second oil __PUNCT__ save initi __PUNCT__
i will push fuel economi standard to __NUM__ mile per gallon by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
as a result __PUNCT__ our convention power automot fleet will reduc it demand by as much __NUM__ million barrel a dai __PUNCT__
what the congress is consid right now __PUNCT__ at thirti __PUNCT__ five mile per gallon __PUNCT__ mark progress after year of inact __PUNCT__ but we made better progress __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ between __NUM__ and __NUM__ the u. __PUNCT__ reduc oil demand by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ without ani of the great new technolog and altern we have avail now __PUNCT__
as the mckinsei report sai __PUNCT__ align u. __PUNCT__ fuel economi standard to intern level could save million of barrel of oil everi dai __PUNCT__
and it will save monei for peopl who us convention fuel vehicl __PUNCT__ perhap as much as __MONEY__ or __MONEY__ a year for peopl who drive long distanc __PUNCT__ as we do out west __PUNCT__
automak __PUNCT__ includ detroit __PUNCT__ can meet these standard by us lighter but safer materi and new engin effici such as ultra __PUNCT__ clean diesel __PUNCT__
here my third oil __PUNCT__ save initi __PUNCT__
we will creat a well __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ wheel low __PUNCT__ carbon fuel requir that reduc the carbon impact of our liquid fuel by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ includ altern fuel that will substitut for about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our gasolin demand __PUNCT__
thi standard will bring our oil consumpt down by anoth __NUM__ million barrel a dai __PUNCT__
these fuel can be produc all over the countri __PUNCT__ creat job in rural area __PUNCT__ and prevent the export of petrodollar to other nation __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we will reduc oil consumpt by non __PUNCT__ auto transport __PUNCT__ ship __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ truck __PUNCT__ and plane __PUNCT__
thi will includ new technolog __PUNCT__ includ some fuel __PUNCT__ switch to electr and renew fuel __PUNCT__ and save anoth __NUM__ barrel a dai __PUNCT__
we will work to increas the effici in non __PUNCT__ transport sector as well __PUNCT__ potenti save anoth __NUM__ barrel per dai __PUNCT__
and i will support smart growth and public transport polici that will reduc drive and save oil __PUNCT__
thi is an integr __PUNCT__ comprehens approach to a tremend nation challeng __PUNCT__
it reli on american technolog __PUNCT__ patriot __PUNCT__ and cooper __PUNCT__
in all __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ with real presidenti leadership and the support of congress and the american peopl __PUNCT__ we will sharpli reduc oil demand by six __PUNCT__ eight or even __NUM__ million barrel a dai __PUNCT__
goal number two is new effici and energi sourc in the electr sector __PUNCT__
i will call for a nation renew portfolio standard of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ rise to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ a renew portfolio standard __PUNCT__ or rp __PUNCT__ requir a certain amount of renew energi to be repres in the electr sold to everi consum __PUNCT__
i know thi is extrem aggress __PUNCT__
but with retir of older __PUNCT__ ineffici power plant __PUNCT__ a new carbon cap and trade system __PUNCT__ and grow demand for electr from plug __PUNCT__ in car __PUNCT__ we must capit on the low __PUNCT__ carbon energi sourc natur provid for us __PUNCT__ wind __PUNCT__ solar __PUNCT__ geotherm __PUNCT__ and biomass __PUNCT__
when i wa chair of the western governor __PUNCT__ associ __PUNCT__ i work close with california governor arnold schwarzenegg to build bipartisan support for __NUM__ megawatt of new renew in the west by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we found that thi amount __PUNCT__ and even more __PUNCT__ would be cost __PUNCT__ effect and achiev __PUNCT__
further __PUNCT__ base on research like the mckinsei report todai __PUNCT__ i will push for a law requir a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ improv in energi product by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
when the western governor __PUNCT__ associ studi my propos to achiev thi __NUM__ by __NUM__ goal __PUNCT__ it found that we could easili achiev those save __PUNCT__ at a __NUM__ to __NUM__ cost __PUNCT__ benefit ratio __PUNCT__ save western custom __MONEY__ billion a year by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
goal three is to reduc greenhous ga emiss at least __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
new scientif evid show that we must move faster than we thought to address climat chang and global warm __PUNCT__
we must show other nation that we will cooper with them to hold atmospher carbon dioxid level under a safe __PUNCT__ accept level __PUNCT__
we will start with a market __PUNCT__ base cap and trade system __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ util and industri will be allow to emit __NUM__ __PUNCT__ as much global warm pollut as thei do todai __PUNCT__ and thei will have to bui right to do so __PUNCT__ creat a real market for pollut reduct __PUNCT__
it like music chair for carbon __PUNCT__
by __NUM__ there will be __NUM__ __PUNCT__ fewer chair __PUNCT__
when these save ar combin with save in the transport sector __PUNCT__ i believ we will reduc greenhous ga emiss overal by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ or more by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
my program allow time for busi and util to prepar and adjust __PUNCT__ and provid time for the feder govern to develop a regim for safe __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ term carbon dispos __PUNCT__ or sequestr __PUNCT__
i believ that coal __PUNCT__ carbon __PUNCT__ clean coal __PUNCT__ will plai a role in our energi futur __PUNCT__ and that we must support the deploy of carbon __PUNCT__ clean coal technolog here and around the world __PUNCT__
we can afford to protect the climat __PUNCT__
given the risk of catastroph climat chang __PUNCT__ we must afford it __PUNCT__
a small commit could save incalcul amount in prevent drought and natur disast __PUNCT__ famin and diseas __PUNCT__ and destruct of coastal area and ocean __PUNCT__
my fourth goal is to capit on our strength in scienc and technolog __PUNCT__
america is the engin room of global innov and ingenu __PUNCT__
whenev i meet our colleg and univers student and faculti __PUNCT__ i see vital new enthusiasm and commit to meet these energi and climat challeng __PUNCT__
it inspir __PUNCT__ but it is also a valuabl resourc __PUNCT__
we have strong educ and research institut __PUNCT__
we have the world best __PUNCT__ train intellectu and academ base __PUNCT__
scientist and technologist from around the world want to studi and work here __PUNCT__
that is a huge strength __PUNCT__ on that we must not wast __PUNCT__ and on that can nourish our growth and leadership in meet the energi and climat challeng __PUNCT__
i don't gener agre with the concept of collect larg sum of feder revenu and put them into vast fund __PUNCT__ hold ten or fifti billion dollar a year __PUNCT__ that the govern would us to pick winner and loser in energi technolog __PUNCT__
but i do think the feder govern must plai a critic role in support and push new technolog __PUNCT__ in collabor with scientist and investor and compani __PUNCT__
i believ we can creat a nation energi innov trust fund with a on __PUNCT__ time fund commit __PUNCT__ a fund that should provid need research and technolog support and that will sustain itself over time by help the privat sector deploi the best energi technolog __PUNCT__
it is here __PUNCT__ in scienc and technolog __PUNCT__ that we have the most potenti to surpris ourselv with larg gain reduc oil consumpt and global warm emiss __PUNCT__
we must invest in our world __PUNCT__ lead institut and program in scienc and technolog __PUNCT__
my fifth goal is to lead by exampl __PUNCT__ make the unit state a beacon of the new energi futur __PUNCT__
we have becom a lone wolf instead of the brave eagl __PUNCT__ at least in the ey of the world __PUNCT__
it is time for us to fly high again __PUNCT__ to see the whole landscap __PUNCT__ to be seen by the world __PUNCT__ to repres freedom __PUNCT__ and human right __PUNCT__
as we implement these far __PUNCT__ reach polici chang at home __PUNCT__ we must immedi return to the intern negoti tabl and support mandatori limit on global warm pollut __PUNCT__ keep atmospher carbon below __NUM__ part per million __PUNCT__
nation such as india and china ar wait to implement big chang in their energi polici becaus the unit state hasn't commit yet __PUNCT__
yet thei know climat protect is in everyon interest __PUNCT__ includ their own __PUNCT__
my intern program will includ work close and bilater with fast __PUNCT__ grow nation like china __PUNCT__ brazil __PUNCT__ south africa __PUNCT__ and india so that thei us new __PUNCT__ low __PUNCT__ carbon technolog to meet their fast __PUNCT__ grow demand __PUNCT__
to achiev thi __PUNCT__ i will cooper with the european union __PUNCT__ the world bank __PUNCT__ the asian partnership __PUNCT__ agenc of the unit nation __PUNCT__ and our alli around the world to help financ the small increment cost of __PUNCT__ do it right __PUNCT__
internation speak __PUNCT__ we must also groom relat with our largest oil supplier __PUNCT__ mexico and canada __PUNCT__ which suppli about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our oil __PUNCT__
my north american energi council will stabil the oil and ga trade __PUNCT__ work on a continent electr grid __PUNCT__ help bring energi resourc and product to market throughout the contin __PUNCT__ and develop a region system for carbon trade __PUNCT__
i know the import of arctic natur ga __PUNCT__ from canada and alaska __PUNCT__ and want to help bring that rel non __PUNCT__ pollut __PUNCT__ plenti __PUNCT__ reliabl resourc to market __PUNCT__
i also know mexico __PUNCT__ and believ that we can have a strong __PUNCT__ construct __PUNCT__ histor relationship with that countri that strengthen it economi and reduc immigr tension __PUNCT__
lastli __PUNCT__ we should work with the gulf nation __PUNCT__ and our partner in consum nation and the unit nation secur council __PUNCT__ to try to creat a multilater system for protect the gulf __PUNCT__
secur the gulf and other oil transport rout __PUNCT__ multilater __PUNCT__ could help stabil oil price and intern peac __PUNCT__
about the oil compani __PUNCT__
i know peopl love to hate the oil compani __PUNCT__
thei have been rake in huge profit __PUNCT__
but i want to invit them to becom energi compani __PUNCT__ and invest in our thrive new energi futur __PUNCT__
the energi industri is invit to the tabl __PUNCT__ but it isn't go to run the tabl the wai it ha in the last five year __PUNCT__
in close __PUNCT__ american need heat and electr in our home __PUNCT__ school and workplac __PUNCT__
we need to get place __PUNCT__
american ar hurt by unpredict and soar energi price __PUNCT__
the wai out is to get off oil __PUNCT__ to creat competit __PUNCT__ to support energi product __PUNCT__ to maxim our strength in scienc and research __PUNCT__ and invest in new technolog and energi sourc __PUNCT__
we can creat a new energi futur __PUNCT__ with broad __PUNCT__ bold stroke __PUNCT__
and we must sharpli reduc our global warm pollut in the process __PUNCT__
a brief __PUNCT__ conceptu speech doesn't provid all the detail __PUNCT__
i know __PUNCT__
so i hope you will go to my websit and look at my new white paper on energi __PUNCT__ secur and climat __PUNCT__
thi is the wai to a bright __PUNCT__ strong __PUNCT__ prosper futur for the unit state __PUNCT__ and for the world __PUNCT__
i call for an energi revolut __PUNCT__ and now __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ i call on you to join it __PUNCT__
thank for your time __PUNCT__
