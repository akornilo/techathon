i recal __PUNCT__ in anoth disast __PUNCT__ when i led an effort in new mexico to help out victim of hurrican katrina in new orlean __PUNCT__
i rememb go out to meet the first plane of refuge and you can feel so helpless in the presenc of peopl that have lost everyth __PUNCT__
we did what a state can do __PUNCT__
new mexico ha experienc the devast and tragedi of huge wildfir and we know well the toll it take on famili and commun __PUNCT__
on a nation level __PUNCT__ i believ that we need to reform our militari to ensur that our nation guard system is never stretch to the break point again __PUNCT__
at the same time that i wa order new mexico fire fighter to california __PUNCT__ the presid deploi three hundr of my state nation guardsmen to iraq __PUNCT__
thi is not what the nation guard wa design for __PUNCT__
the war is leav our homeland vulner to natur disast __PUNCT__
we have to end the war and get all our troop out as soon as possibl __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will get all the troop out within a year after i take offic __PUNCT__
and i go to add fifti thousand troop to the activ __PUNCT__ duti armi and marin corp __PUNCT__ so that the guard can protect american right here at home __PUNCT__

we must make sure that thei have the best equip __PUNCT__ the best health care __PUNCT__ and the best benefit for their famili __PUNCT__
thei deserv noth less __PUNCT__
i deepli believ that the come dai will prove that even the greatest natur destruct __PUNCT__ is no match for the hope will of the american peopl __PUNCT__
we will put the piec back togeth __PUNCT__
we will rebuild peopl home __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we will do it __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i want to talk with you about our foreign polici in our own hemispher __PUNCT__
it is painfulli clear that georg bush disastr invas of iraq ha wreck our intern credibl __PUNCT__
it ha damag our allianc __PUNCT__ embolden our enemi __PUNCT__ deplet our treasuri __PUNCT__ exhaust our arm forc and fuel global anger against us __PUNCT__
the war continu to divert us from the real war against the terrorist who attack us on __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and it ha undermin our abil to lead the world on press issu such as nuclear prolifer and global warm __PUNCT__
less discuss __PUNCT__ but just as import is that the great damag caus by iraq ha extend even to our own back yard __PUNCT__ in latin america __PUNCT__
georg bush cowboi diplomaci ha not just led us to ignor urgent challeng in our own region __PUNCT__ but ha alien our friend in thi hemispher __PUNCT__
as wa so evid when mr __PUNCT__ bush tour latin america last march __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ american is grow at an alarm rate across the region __PUNCT__
through neglect we have turn mani of our natur alli into fair __PUNCT__ weather friend and outright enemi __PUNCT__
the presid onc vow to treat latin america __PUNCT__ not as an afterthought __PUNCT__ but as a fundament commit __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ despit latin america econom and nation __PUNCT__ secur import to the unit state __PUNCT__ he ha neglect to engag the region __PUNCT__
thi polici of neglig is danger __PUNCT__ and it cannot continu __PUNCT__
we need bold action to repair the damag __PUNCT__
the next presid must have a clear plan for engag __PUNCT__ and the experi to implement it __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will focu on seven strategi to rebuild our relationship with the rest of our hemispher __PUNCT__
at all time __PUNCT__ we must preserv our faith in american valu and renew our courag to connect with other nation __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ diplomaci __PUNCT__ we must engag all latin american countri diplomat __PUNCT__ includ troublesom regim like venezuela __PUNCT__
thi doe not mean make concess __PUNCT__
it mean honest talk and tough negoti __PUNCT__
it mean try to find common ground where we can and strengthen our interest where we can't __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we need a realist approach toward cuba __PUNCT__
current our polici with regard to cuba ha been static and reactiv __PUNCT__
what we need is a vibrant and pro __PUNCT__ activ polici that deal sensibl with econom and person issu like trade and famili visit __PUNCT__
presid bush ha been impos sever restrict on famili visit and remitt to cuba __PUNCT__
i strongli oppos these cruel and counterproduct rule __PUNCT__
cuban __PUNCT__ american should be allow to visit their famili __PUNCT__ and thei should be abl to help them out financi __PUNCT__
the bush administr even deni us armi sergeant carlo lazo __PUNCT__ who had won the bronz star in iraq __PUNCT__ permiss to visit hi two son live in cuba __PUNCT__
that is appal __PUNCT__
famili valu must mean actual valu famili __PUNCT__
furthermor __PUNCT__ these restrict bolster castro abil to portrai himself as stand up to the big bulli in washington __PUNCT__
put simpli __PUNCT__ these rule have been good for castro and bad for american and cuban __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will allow unimped famili visit and remitt by cuban __PUNCT__ american to their rel in cuba __PUNCT__
i will work with the cuban __PUNCT__ american commun to heal the bitter divid that inevit cut through thi issu __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we can creat a polici that is good for all american __PUNCT__
and i am readi to reassess the trade embargo __PUNCT__ in exchang for cuba releas all polit prison and make posit move toward democrat freedom __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we should push for a latin american countri to have a perman seat on the un secur council __PUNCT__
mexico __PUNCT__ brazil __PUNCT__ argentina __PUNCT__ and chile ar obviou potenti choic __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ human right __PUNCT__
we need to replac inflammatori rhetor about __PUNCT__ regim chang __PUNCT__ with real promot of human and democrat freedom __PUNCT__
latino admir american democrat valu __PUNCT__ but thei know hypocrisi and thei seen it __PUNCT__
guantanamo __PUNCT__
abu ghraib __PUNCT__
secret prison __PUNCT__
tortur __PUNCT__
let me be clear __PUNCT__ i will be a presid who follow the constitut __PUNCT__
and i will not onli talk about human right __PUNCT__ i will be guid by a strong faith in the univers valu of human digniti __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ fair trade __PUNCT__
we must promot trade agreement that includ strong and enforc labor __PUNCT__ environment __PUNCT__ and human right standard __PUNCT__
free and fair trade can benefit both latin american and us worker __PUNCT__
it will benefit consum throughout the region __PUNCT__
and it will bind closer the nation of the entir hemispher __PUNCT__
sixth __PUNCT__ develop __PUNCT__
we must lead the hemispher in promot econom develop and reduc poverti __PUNCT__
in an interdepend world __PUNCT__ extrem poverti in on nation is the concern of all nation __PUNCT__
strong and equit econom growth in latin america is in the us nation interest __PUNCT__
it must be a prioriti __PUNCT__
those who think we can keep poor immigr out with wall __PUNCT__
do not understand the desper will of starv men and women __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ seventh __PUNCT__ we need comprehens immigr reform that is realist and human __PUNCT__
we need to aggress polic the border and punish employ who hire undocu worker __PUNCT__
but we must also recogn that we simpli can't deport the twelv million who ar alreadi here __PUNCT__
we need a tough __PUNCT__ fair path to legal __PUNCT__
our loftiest ideal ar not inconsist with our most realist polici object __PUNCT__
and after so mani year of a foreign polici that ha ignor both principl and pragmat __PUNCT__ we need a new kind of realism __PUNCT__
thi new realism will go beyond the old __PUNCT__ balanc __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ power polit of the cold war __PUNCT__
we need to understand that what goe on in other countri affect us profoundli __PUNCT__ and that skill american diplomat leadership is need to meet the challeng of an ag of interdepend __PUNCT__
an ag of global warm __PUNCT__
of global terror __PUNCT__
of global pandem __PUNCT__
we need to lead with skill and moral credibl __PUNCT__
across a wide rang of econom __PUNCT__ cultur and polit issu __PUNCT__ our futur prosper and secur is tightli interwoven with that of all the peopl of the america __PUNCT__
venezuela is our fourth largest oil supplier __PUNCT__ provid __NUM__ percent of our annual oil consumpt __PUNCT__
mexico is the third largest market for us __PUNCT__ grown wheat __PUNCT__ corn __PUNCT__ cotton and soybean __PUNCT__
small central american countri such as costa rica __PUNCT__ guatemala and hondura ar major supplier of the fresh fruit american eat __PUNCT__ and argentina __PUNCT__ ecuador __PUNCT__ and peru ar top ten veget supplier __PUNCT__
the presid just doesn't get it __PUNCT__
he seem to think that latin goodwil toward the unit state is someth we can take for grant __PUNCT__
he seem to think that the fact of our geographi guarante the fit of our relationship __PUNCT__
and he continu to believ that region will somehow follow a nation that refus to lead __PUNCT__
thei will not __PUNCT__
in the absenc of principl leadership from us __PUNCT__ thei will turn elsewher __PUNCT__
anywher __PUNCT__ to whoever step up __PUNCT__
hugo chávez of venezuela ha had seriou success nourish anti __PUNCT__ us anger throughout the hemispher __PUNCT__
chávez enhanc hi own power by us our countri as hi whip boi __PUNCT__
like hi friend __PUNCT__ presid ahmadinejad of iran __PUNCT__ he thrive on conflict and incendiari rhetor __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ hi gain ar secur at our expens __PUNCT__
we need a presid who understand intern polit and know how to respond effect to li and provoc __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will stand up for thi countri not by return insult __PUNCT__ but by expos distort __PUNCT__
we need to take leader like chavez serious __PUNCT__ not becaus thei ar truth __PUNCT__ thei ar not __PUNCT__
we need to take them serious becaus thei ar tap into real resent against us __PUNCT__ and then amplifi it for their own purpos __PUNCT__
across the world __PUNCT__ the bush foreign polici ha intensifi anti __PUNCT__ american and plai into the hand of our worst enemi __PUNCT__
the bush administr short __PUNCT__ sight __PUNCT__ clumsi diplomaci ha help leader like chávez and castro creat an axi of anti __PUNCT__ american nation across the region __PUNCT__
with the benefit of venezuela oil wealth __PUNCT__ chávez ha forg ti with leader such as evo moral in bolivia and daniel ortega in nicaragua __PUNCT__
these four countri __PUNCT__ venezuela __PUNCT__ cuba __PUNCT__ bolivia __PUNCT__ and nicaragua __PUNCT__ have form a trade agreement that seek to exclud and undermin us influenc in latin america __PUNCT__
chávez is reach out to long __PUNCT__ stand us partner such as argentina __PUNCT__
hi trade and econom develop propos ar fill the void left by our bankrupt leadership in the region __PUNCT__
in recent year __PUNCT__ venezuela ha purchas more than __MONEY__ billion worth of argentin govern bond and other debt relief instrument __PUNCT__
a few month ago __PUNCT__ argentina presid nestor kirchner met with chávez and evo moral in bolivia __PUNCT__ where progress wa made on a deal to ship more than __MONEY__ billion worth of bolivian natur ga to argentina __PUNCT__
the chávez method of __PUNCT__ checkbook diplomaci __PUNCT__ extend to the aid he provid to peru follow that countri catastroph earthquak in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
hundr of peopl were kill __PUNCT__
thousand more displac __PUNCT__
the nation look to the us for help __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ it wa venezuela that respond with more aid than the bush administr __PUNCT__
we hand chávez yet anoth public relat coup in the region __PUNCT__
i focu on hugo chávez not becaus he is the diseas in latin america __PUNCT__ but becaus he is yet anoth symptom __PUNCT__
the diseas is arrog __PUNCT__
the next presid must take a far more realist look at what is need to restor us stand in our own hemispher __PUNCT__
we need a presid who understand the region and can talk directli to all the player __PUNCT__
and i can speak in spanish when need __PUNCT__
yo hablo el idioma de la diplomacia __PUNCT__
i know such direct engag can work __PUNCT__
i sat down with fidel castro and negoti the releas of cuban polit prison __PUNCT__
the organ of american state ha ask me to serv as special envoi for hemispher affair __PUNCT__ to help renew relat with our friend and restart talk with our foe __PUNCT__
onli seriou dialogu on issu such as immigr and trade can lead to seriou solut and a seriou relationship with latin america __PUNCT__
we must rememb that preserv your popular is no recip for inspir a nation __PUNCT__ let alon a region or a world __PUNCT__
i ow my success in bring peopl togeth and solv problem to take risk __PUNCT__
sometim you have to lai thing on the line to get result __PUNCT__
i recal when on of my constitu wa taken hostag in sudan __PUNCT__
he wa an american journalist from my own state and he wa captur with two aid from the african nation of chad __PUNCT__
thei were imprison on phoni charg of espionag __PUNCT__ i had no reason to be optimist about their releas __PUNCT__
but the journalist wife ask me to go and try to get him out __PUNCT__
so i went __PUNCT__
the dictat of that countri __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ bashir __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ you can have the american __PUNCT__ but the other two from chad __PUNCT__ thei stai __PUNCT__
at thi point i could have left with the american __PUNCT__ but i said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i am bring them all out __PUNCT__
it wa not the easi choic but it wa the right choic __PUNCT__
we went back into the negoti and i left with all three men __PUNCT__
there wa no time then for poll or consult __PUNCT__
nor is thi a time for polit calcul __PUNCT__
we cannot afford leadership that ha not been test __PUNCT__
my colleagu in thi race have my respect __PUNCT__ but it is a simpl fact that the next intern deal negoti by ani on of them will be their first __PUNCT__
we also cannot afford anoth presid who doesn't understand that stubborn is not strength __PUNCT__
consult with friend __PUNCT__ coordin with alli __PUNCT__ and negoti with enemi __PUNCT__ is not weak __PUNCT__
it is what you need to do to get thing done __PUNCT__
it is the basi for restor america intern leadership __PUNCT__
the bush administr ha miss too mani opportun to strengthen us engag __PUNCT__
over and over __PUNCT__ the presid ha fail to address urgent issu __PUNCT__ especi __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ develop and immigr __PUNCT__
thi __PUNCT__ iron triangl __PUNCT__ of concern is tightli weld __PUNCT__ and we need a comprehens vision to tackl them __PUNCT__
at it root __PUNCT__ illeg immigr is an econom problem __PUNCT__ driven by the lack of decent job for peopl in their home countri __PUNCT__
so long as other economi fail to produc job __PUNCT__ peopl will continu to come here __PUNCT__
as long as we have a monopoli on hope __PUNCT__ we will be a magnet for the hope __PUNCT__
if we want to stop illeg immigr __PUNCT__ we need to promot equit develop in latin america __PUNCT__
there is no wai around it __PUNCT__
we need trade agreement that creat good job in all countri __PUNCT__ includ our own __PUNCT__ while promot human and worker right __PUNCT__
we need a comprehens immigr solut in thi countri __PUNCT__ on that includ a path to legal __PUNCT__
part of that is increas border enforc with smarter technolog and more guard __PUNCT__
it work __PUNCT__
but you know what won't work __PUNCT__ thi wall __PUNCT__
i think that senat clinton __PUNCT__ obama __PUNCT__ and biden were wrong to vote to build a wall between the unit state and it neighbor __PUNCT__
thei talk about chang __PUNCT__
but thei vote for the most blatant exampl of old __PUNCT__ style washington solut __PUNCT__ expens __PUNCT__ dumb __PUNCT__ and entir the product of polit calcul __PUNCT__
thei onli fund half the wall __PUNCT__
anyon outsid the beltwai could tell you how well half a wall work __PUNCT__
what next __PUNCT__ fund for half of a dam __PUNCT__ half an airplan __PUNCT__ half a withdraw from iraq __PUNCT__ appar the peopl in washington who want to build a __NUM__ foot wall have never heard of __NUM__ foot ladder __PUNCT__
we need new think in the white hous __PUNCT__ the kind that would never allow such a symbol along our border __PUNCT__
if your latin america polici start with a wall between cultur __PUNCT__
it will quickli collaps into rubbl __PUNCT__
we need new think in the white hous on immigr and trade __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ the indiffer of the bush administr ha enabl chavez and other to convinc mani latino that expand trade with the us is bad for latin america __PUNCT__
the good new is that there ar real opportun to build mutual __PUNCT__ benefici trade and develop partnership with latin american countri __PUNCT__
we can have trade agreement that ar good for worker __PUNCT__ compani __PUNCT__ and nation __PUNCT__
agreement that creat job __PUNCT__ fight poverti __PUNCT__ and reduc the incent for peopl to emigr illeg to the unit state __PUNCT__
other countri ar alreadi take advantag of our miss opportun __PUNCT__
china trade with latin america ha doubl in just the past six year __PUNCT__
the us need to get off the sidelin and back into the game __PUNCT__
it mean job __PUNCT__ here in the u. __PUNCT__ and in latin america __PUNCT__
we also need to recogn that for mani year to come the us economi will continu to attract latino worker __PUNCT__
while our law sai thei cannot come here __PUNCT__ our economi sai thei should __PUNCT__
we need to be realist __PUNCT__
our economi demand these worker __PUNCT__ and it make no sens to have them here illeg rather than legal __PUNCT__
as we crack down on illeg immigr __PUNCT__ we need to allow more legal immigr __PUNCT__
we need a reason guest __PUNCT__ worker program __PUNCT__ and an earn path to legal for those alreadi here __PUNCT__
and we need to work with the mexican govern to get them to stop encourag illeg immigr __PUNCT__ and instead to start creat more job in mexico __PUNCT__
we also need a more effect approach to the problem of illeg drug __PUNCT__
recent action in congress would reduc the emphasi on militari intervent __PUNCT__ and would increas us support for rural develop __PUNCT__ judici reform __PUNCT__ and law enforc assist program __PUNCT__
thi is a need step in the right direct __PUNCT__
our militari cannot solv everi problem by itself __PUNCT__
as with illeg immigr __PUNCT__ we need to recogn that drug ar a develop and econom incent issu __PUNCT__
law enforc is essenti __PUNCT__ but it is not enough __PUNCT__
to fight drug traffick __PUNCT__ we need to arrest and punish dealer __PUNCT__ but we also need to fight the profit of the trade itself __PUNCT__
we need to do more to reduc demand at home i learn thi in new mexico __PUNCT__
as we shut down over __NUM__ meth lab __PUNCT__ reduc suppli __PUNCT__
we also undermin demand by provid qualiti drug treatment to break the addict cycl __PUNCT__
and we must rememb that a farmer who can make a live do someth legal __PUNCT__ is far less like to choos drug product __PUNCT__
a worker with a good job is less like to fall into the clutch of drug smuggler __PUNCT__
stronger latin american economi will be less vulner to drug lord __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ we cannot truli engag latin america if we do not includ the the __NUM__ million indigen peopl who live there __PUNCT__
too mani indigen peopl live in deep poverti __PUNCT__
too mani lack access to the essenti servic that other in their own countri take for grant __PUNCT__
too mani ar ignor by their own govern __PUNCT__
it is essenti that our polici respect indigen tradit and promot the right of indigen peopl __PUNCT__
after year of neglect and miss opportun __PUNCT__ the presid trip last march to latin america wa too littl __PUNCT__ too late __PUNCT__
the next administr must do better __PUNCT__
we will need a renew commit to latin america base upon engag __PUNCT__ dialogu __PUNCT__ and cooper __PUNCT__
we need equit trade agreement __PUNCT__ and comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__
have spent part of my childhood in mexico __PUNCT__ and have travel wide in the region __PUNCT__ i understand the complic dynam of inter __PUNCT__ american relat __PUNCT__
my mexican mother taught me to valu and respect latino cultur __PUNCT__ just as my american father made me so proud to be a citizen of the unit state __PUNCT__
my autobiographi wa titl __PUNCT__ between world __PUNCT__ not becaus we ar world apart __PUNCT__ but rather becaus we ar so close __PUNCT__ and becaus it is so import that we work togeth toward common goal __PUNCT__
woodi allen onc said that eighti percent of success is show up __PUNCT__
these recent year __PUNCT__ we have not shown up in latin america __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we been shown up by lesser leader __PUNCT__
that must chang __PUNCT__
if we do not attempt to succe in the region __PUNCT__ then sure we will fail __PUNCT__
move forward __PUNCT__ we must preserv the share faith of the peopl of thi hemispher __PUNCT__ in the principl of human digniti and democrat freedom __PUNCT__
we must have the simpl courag to be strong __PUNCT__
we must step up and lead __PUNCT__
mucha gracia __PUNCT__ thank you veri much __PUNCT__
