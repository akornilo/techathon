i support school choic through public charter school __PUNCT__
we have mani wonder charter school __PUNCT__ but to ensur qualiti educ for all of our children thei must be held to the same standard of account as the rest of our public school __PUNCT__
parent ar critic to make our school work not onli for new mexico but for our nation __PUNCT__ you as educ cannot do it alon __PUNCT__
we must fund innov parent involv and educ program __PUNCT__

thi fall __PUNCT__ everi elementari school parent will receiv a veri simpl handbook that explicitli tell them how thei can support their child success __PUNCT__
you need their support and thei need your collabor __PUNCT__
when school and famili work togeth the child is the winner __PUNCT__ and thi is what it all about __PUNCT__ our children __PUNCT__ on of the most import task face us todai is make sure our school ar prepar our student for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__

we must also ensur that our high school ar prepar more math and scienc student and i will fight for the creation of new math and scienc academi across the countri __PUNCT__ and i make sure that girl and children of color know thei welcom there as well __PUNCT__
let me close with what at the foremost in your mind __PUNCT__ when elect presid i will get rid of no child left behind it not work __PUNCT__ and it not fair __PUNCT__
now don't get me wrong __PUNCT__ i not against account __PUNCT__ but i believ in account when it is fair and when school ar fund and given the support thei need __PUNCT__
presid bush promis to be the educ presid __PUNCT__
but like mani other promis and thing thi administr ha said it wa go to do __PUNCT__ after the photo __PUNCT__ op __PUNCT__ the polici got stuck in a drawer and forgotten __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we can't afford to forget our children __PUNCT__
in the interest of time here the short list of the mani issu that need to be address __PUNCT__ get rid of the pass/fail model of ayp provid a more meaning and honest pictur of a school that util more than a singl test score us fairer test and realist timelin for our english languag learner and special educ student provid more fund to help our student succe __PUNCT__
