thank you for that kind introduct __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ nuclear deterr work __PUNCT__
in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ it won't __PUNCT__
mutual assur destruct deter the soviet union __PUNCT__ but noth will stop suicid jihadist from us a nuclear bomb if thei get their hand on on __PUNCT__
if al qaeda obtain nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ thei could smuggl them into american citi __PUNCT__ and thei would not hesit to us them with the same ruthless that allow them to fly airplan fill with peopl into build fill with peopl __PUNCT__
we know that al qaeda want nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
we also know that pakistan a.q __PUNCT__
khan sold nuclear materi to rogu state __PUNCT__
we know that part of the former soviet nuclear arsen still ar not secur __PUNCT__ and that there ar poorli __PUNCT__ secur nuclear materi around the world __PUNCT__
the prolifer of nuclear weapon to new countri __PUNCT__ abov all to north korea and pakistan __PUNCT__ ha increas further the opportun for jihadist to obtain them __PUNCT__ as ha the diffus of nuclear energi technolog that can be convert to weapon program __PUNCT__
iran __PUNCT__ a nation with close ti to the world most skill terrorist organ __PUNCT__ hezbollah __PUNCT__ mai be on the verg of enter the nuclear club __PUNCT__
and al qaeda ha said that thei wish to kill __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ million children __PUNCT__
in their mad __PUNCT__ thei claim that such a slaughter of innoc would __PUNCT__ balanc the scale of justic __PUNCT__ for crime that thei alleg we have commit against muslim __PUNCT__
we would be mad not to take them at their word __PUNCT__
you mai have heard me speak elsewher about the need for what i call a __PUNCT__ new realism __PUNCT__ in american foreign polici __PUNCT__
by thi i mean that we need to wake up and see that the greatest threat we face todai __PUNCT__ from global warm to terror __PUNCT__ do not face onli us __PUNCT__ and that thi mean that unilater action usual will not work __PUNCT__
to defend ourselv in the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__ we mai occasion need to act alon __PUNCT__ but usual we must work with other __PUNCT__
build and lead strong intern coalit should be our first thought when we face common challeng __PUNCT__ not an afterthought when our unilater cours ha fail __PUNCT__
a new realism for the __NUM__ centuri also understand that mani threat todai come not from state __PUNCT__ but rather from societi __PUNCT__ includ our own societi __PUNCT__
not from armi mass or nation state target us with missil __PUNCT__ but rather from complex social trend __PUNCT__ such as our own consumpt of fossil fuel __PUNCT__
not so much from hostil state as from hostil individu __PUNCT__ empow by their willing to kill and die for fanat belief __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we must rebuild our militari and be prepar to us it when we must __PUNCT__ but we also must reject the unilateralist illus of recent year __PUNCT__
our remark militari power give us the abil to lead __PUNCT__
but other follow us not becaus we intimid them with the argument of our power __PUNCT__ but becaus we inspir them with the power of our argument __PUNCT__
defend ourselv from new danger requir new think __PUNCT__ new strategi and new tactic __PUNCT__
we need to adapt our idea about nation secur to an ag in which the nuclear threat come not from a missil __PUNCT__ but from a suitcas or a cargo hull __PUNCT__
not from a nation __PUNCT__ which can be deter by the threat of retali __PUNCT__ but from a shadowi terrorist network with no return address __PUNCT__
that a small group of stateless terrorist could destroi new york or washington with a black __PUNCT__ market nuclear bomb epitom just how much the world ha chang __PUNCT__ and how urgent it is that we lead other nation with a comprehens global plan to lock down all of the world fission materi __PUNCT__
quickli __PUNCT__
befor terrorist get their hand on a nuclear bomb __PUNCT__
and i would add anoth point __PUNCT__ meet the challeng of nuclear terror is not just a nation secur imper for the unit state __PUNCT__ it also is a moral imper __PUNCT__
we creat the first atom bomb __PUNCT__ becaus we fear that hitler would get them first __PUNCT__
we ar the onli countri that ever ha us them __PUNCT__ to end world war ii __PUNCT__
dure the cold war __PUNCT__ we and the soviet built enough thermonuclear weapon to destroi all human life on the planet sever time over __PUNCT__
for six decad __PUNCT__ all of human ha live with the knowledg that everyth we know could end in a flash of light __PUNCT__
america led the world into the ag of nuclear fear becaus we were compel to do so by totalitarian enemi __PUNCT__
we now have the urgent moral duti to lead the world out of the ag of nuclear fear __PUNCT__ iron becaus we confront a veri new and differ kind of totalitarian enemi __PUNCT__
i wa energi secretari under presid clinton __PUNCT__
my depart wa respons for the design __PUNCT__ manufactur and mainten of our stockpil of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
these weapon ar not abstract to me __PUNCT__ to see on of them is to be astound that million of death can be compress into such a tini packag __PUNCT__
to know intim our nuclear arsen is to know intim how our speci could destroi itself __PUNCT__
sam nunn put it succinctli __PUNCT__ at the dawn of a new centuri __PUNCT__ we find ourselv in a new arm race __PUNCT__
terrorist ar race to get weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ we ought to be race to stop them __PUNCT__
thi is an existenti problem __PUNCT__
it is urgent __PUNCT__
we need to free human from the threat of nuclear destruct __PUNCT__
the unit state cannot do thi alon __PUNCT__
but it certainli cannot be done without american leadership __PUNCT__
i believ that if we give thi matter the attent it deserv __PUNCT__ we can prevent a nuclear __NUM__ __PUNCT__
the reason i am optimist is becaus there is a finit amount of fission materi in the world __PUNCT__ and make it is well beyond the capabl of terrorist group __PUNCT__
therefor __PUNCT__ if we lock down all the nuclear weapon and bomb __PUNCT__ grade materi which exist __PUNCT__ and also make sure that all futur nuclear fuel and spent __PUNCT__ fuel is secur __PUNCT__ we can prevent what former assist secretari of defens graham allison ha call __PUNCT__ the ultim prevent catastroph __PUNCT__
secur all the world nuke will be a huge task __PUNCT__ but not an imposs on __PUNCT__
a lot of good thing alreadi have been done __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ nunn __PUNCT__ lugar cooper threat program ha deactiv and destroi hundr of missil and thousand of warhead __PUNCT__ and ha improv secur for much of the former soviet arsen __PUNCT__
and the bush administr ha done some good thing __PUNCT__ such as the prolifer secur initi __PUNCT__ the global threat initi __PUNCT__ and the __NUM__ bratislava accord between bush and putin on nuclear secur __PUNCT__
when i wa energi secretari under presid clinton __PUNCT__ doe also did mani thing to secur russian nuke __PUNCT__
we increas fund __PUNCT__ from __MONEY__ million to __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__ for doe materi protect __PUNCT__ control and account program __PUNCT__ to protect russian nuclear warhead and weapon __PUNCT__ grade fissil materi from fall into the hand of terrorist or black market dealer __PUNCT__
i also sign the implement agreement for the mpc&ampa program __PUNCT__ which put the program on a secur foot with the russian __PUNCT__
and we got an emerg __MONEY__ million supplement to dispos of russian weapon __PUNCT__ usabl plutonium __PUNCT__
we work close with the russian ministri of atom energi to determin how to us these fund to elimin __NUM__ ton of russian plutonium __PUNCT__
but i am sorri to sai that the bush administr got entangl in delai and conflict with the russian __PUNCT__ and still ha not spent thi __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
those __NUM__ ton of plutonium ar still there __PUNCT__ and now it even appear that fund is in danger in congress __PUNCT__
i strongli urg congress to fund thi import nonprolifer program __PUNCT__
dure my tenur at doe __PUNCT__ our nuclear citi initi __PUNCT__ nci __PUNCT__ actual got the russian to agre to close down their avangard nuclear weapon plant __PUNCT__ as we fund the transit of displac weapon worker to non __PUNCT__ militari job __PUNCT__
thi wa monei well spent to protect america and the world __PUNCT__
we should have expand thi program __PUNCT__ but instead the bush administr allow the nci agreement to laps when it came up for renew in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ befor __NUM__ the bush administr even plan to kill both the plutonium disposit program and the nuclear citi initi __PUNCT__ and to thi dai thei continu to under __PUNCT__ fund both program __PUNCT__
meanwhil __PUNCT__ we ar spend __MONEY__ billion a month on iraq __PUNCT__
of the mani wai in which mr __PUNCT__ bush ill __PUNCT__ conceiv war ha distract us from our real nation secur need __PUNCT__ thi is the most danger __PUNCT__
we must do more __PUNCT__ much more __PUNCT__ to secur russian nuclear materi __PUNCT__
at of the end of fy __NUM__ u.s. __PUNCT__ fund secur and account upgrad had been complet for bare half of former soviet at __PUNCT__ risk site __PUNCT__ leav mani site vulner even to rel unsophist terrorist or traffick __PUNCT__
and even the upgrad build remain vulner to well __PUNCT__ train attack __PUNCT__ of the sort we have seen in action in russia in recent year __PUNCT__
we need more rapid progress in consolid nuclear weapon and materi into a smaller number of site __PUNCT__ and in make sure that everi site is secur __PUNCT__
we and the russian also should take our nuclear weapon off hair __PUNCT__ trigger alert statu __PUNCT__
not onli is thi cold war relic unnecessari todai __PUNCT__ but it also prevent us from secur all of the russian arsen __PUNCT__ as thei don't want to provid us with total inform on their nuclear weapon when we have thousand of our own readi to be launch at them on a minut notic __PUNCT__
the situat in some other part of the world is even more danger than in russia __PUNCT__
in sever countri __PUNCT__ civilian nuclear facil often ar less secur than a groceri store __PUNCT__ and even weapon __PUNCT__ grade nuclear materi ar vulner to theft __PUNCT__
pakistan weapon ar the most like to fall into the wrong hand __PUNCT__
thei could be raid by al qaeda group or sold by insid __PUNCT__
and we cannot exclud the possibl that jihadist could come to power __PUNCT__
we need to work __PUNCT__ perhap quietli __PUNCT__ with gener musharraf to insur that __PUNCT__ in the event of a coup __PUNCT__ jihadist would not be abl to us the pakistani nuclear arsen __PUNCT__
the global threat reduct initi ha acceler the remov of nuclear materi from site around the world __PUNCT__ but huge secur gap remain __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ two __PUNCT__ third of u.s. __PUNCT__ suppli highli enrich uranium __PUNCT__ heu __PUNCT__ still is not cover by the u. __PUNCT__ take __PUNCT__ back offer __PUNCT__ and there ar too mani reactor in the world still us bomb __PUNCT__ grade fuel __PUNCT__
a comprehens global plan we can do better __PUNCT__
we can prevent the ultim prevent catastroph and end the era of nuclear fear __PUNCT__
but we need to realli focu on it __PUNCT__ and do the hard work that need to be done __PUNCT__
it is a question of commit __PUNCT__ of leadership __PUNCT__
of not take our ey off the ball __PUNCT__
as i said __PUNCT__ some good thing have alreadi been done __PUNCT__ but thei have been piecem and inadequ __PUNCT__
it took a manhattan project to creat the bomb __PUNCT__
we need a new manhattan project to stop the bomb __PUNCT__ a comprehens program to secur all nuclear weapon and all weapon __PUNCT__ usabl materi __PUNCT__ worldwid __PUNCT__
the unit state must lead a global coalit to establish effect __PUNCT__ univers nuclear secur standard that reduc the number of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and make sure that those that exist ar safe from theft or divers __PUNCT__
we also must secur all fission materi associ with nuclear energi and research __PUNCT__ with a __PUNCT__ global clean __PUNCT__ out __PUNCT__ which remov all weapon __PUNCT__ grade materi world __PUNCT__ wide from vulner site __PUNCT__ and consolid it into a limit number of highli __PUNCT__ secur facil __PUNCT__
a comprehens strategi must focu on four kei task __PUNCT__
if we accomplish them all __PUNCT__ it is unlik that terrorist will get a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
if we fail to do them __PUNCT__ sooner or later thei will __PUNCT__
we need to __PUNCT__ halt nuclear weapon prolifer halt nuclear weapon product and reduc the size of nuclear arsen halt or secur civilian program that requir or produc bomb __PUNCT__ grade materi consolid and secur all exist fissil materi and all futur product associ with nuclear energi and research worldwid the first task __PUNCT__ halt nuclear weapon prolifer __PUNCT__ is urgent and immedi __PUNCT__ becaus we ar on the edg of a precipic with north korea and iran __PUNCT__
if we don't stop them __PUNCT__ sever other nation __PUNCT__ especi their neighbor __PUNCT__ mai decid to go nuclear as well __PUNCT__
and the more state that have nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ the greater the risk that terrorist will acquir them __PUNCT__
in deal with difficult regim like iran and north korea __PUNCT__ we must rememb that no nation ha ever been forc to renounc nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ but that mani nation have been convinc to renounc them __PUNCT__
if we unit the world behind the right carrot and stick __PUNCT__ and provid the north korean and the iranian with face __PUNCT__ save wai to step back from the nuclear brink __PUNCT__ we will prevail __PUNCT__
some good step have been taken recent __PUNCT__ and there ar sign that we mai succe __PUNCT__
meaning sanction accompani by posit incent and secur guarante lessen the paranoia and strengthen the pragmatist __PUNCT__
the kei is convinc these regim that thei will be more secur without nuclear weapon than with them __PUNCT__
to convinc them __PUNCT__ we absolut need russia and china __PUNCT__
to implement the recent agreement with north korea __PUNCT__ and to get them to dismantl the devic thei alreadi have __PUNCT__ china is the kei __PUNCT__
to stop iran from enrich uranium __PUNCT__ it russia __PUNCT__
whenev the un secur council is involv __PUNCT__ we need both russia and china __PUNCT__
thi is why the current administr allergi to strateg diplomaci ha been so destruct __PUNCT__
if we had threaten the iranian and north korean less __PUNCT__ talk to them more __PUNCT__ and built stronger relat with the other great power __PUNCT__ the world would be a safer place todai __PUNCT__
we need to get back on the diplomat track __PUNCT__ and stai there __PUNCT__ if we ar to prevent further nuclear prolifer __PUNCT__
we also need to strengthen the npt regim __PUNCT__ which ha been weaken in recent year __PUNCT__ as india and pakistan and north korea have gone nuclear __PUNCT__ and as iran attempt to do so __PUNCT__
we need a new global non __PUNCT__ prolifer agreement which prevent state from develop nuclear fuel __PUNCT__ enrich capabl __PUNCT__ and then abandon the npt as thei rush to make bomb __PUNCT__
we also need to negoti a tough univers verif system that give intern inspector immedi and unfett access to all site __PUNCT__ worldwid __PUNCT__
get all nation to agre to a stronger nonprolifer regim will requir skill diplomaci and new think __PUNCT__
which bring me to the second task __PUNCT__ the nuclear state must stop make new weapon and must reduc the size of their exist arsen __PUNCT__
the non __PUNCT__ prolifer treati commit non __PUNCT__ nuclear state to forego nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and it also commit the nuclear weapon state to the goal of nuclear disarma __PUNCT__
to get other to take the npt serious __PUNCT__ we need to take it serious ourselv __PUNCT__
we should re __PUNCT__ affirm our commit to the long __PUNCT__ term goal of global nuclear disarma __PUNCT__ and we should invit the russian to join us in a moratorium on all new nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
and we should negoti further stage reduct in our arsen __PUNCT__ beyond what ha alreadi been agre __PUNCT__ over the next decad __PUNCT__
in a world in which nuclear terror rather than war with russia is the main threat __PUNCT__ reduc all nuclear arsen __PUNCT__ in a care __PUNCT__ orderli wai __PUNCT__ make everyon safer __PUNCT__
negoti to reduc our arsen also ar our diplomat ac __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ hole __PUNCT__
we can leverag our own propos reduct to get the other nuclear power to do the same __PUNCT__ and simultan get the non __PUNCT__ nuclear power to forego both weapon and nuclear fuel enrich __PUNCT__ and to agre to rigor global safeguard and verif procedur __PUNCT__
the unit state also should ratifi the comprehens test ban treati __PUNCT__ not onli becaus it is good polici __PUNCT__ but also to send a signal to the world that america ha turn a corner __PUNCT__ and onc again will be a global leader __PUNCT__ not a unilateralist loner __PUNCT__
our third task is to put the lid on the most danger civilian technolog __PUNCT__
current __PUNCT__ there ar over __NUM__ ton of heu in civilian power and research program in over __NUM__ nation __PUNCT__
it take as littl as __NUM__ kg to produc a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
there ar no fewer than __NUM__ oper research reactor __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ countri __PUNCT__
some __NUM__ of these have __NUM__ kg or more of heu stock __PUNCT__
mani ar poorli secur __PUNCT__
civilian plutonium is even more worrisom __PUNCT__
commerci reprocess plant in britain __PUNCT__ franc __PUNCT__ and russia separ about __NUM__ ton of civilian plutonium from spent fuel each year __PUNCT__ but most of it is not us as civilian reactor fuel __PUNCT__
rather __PUNCT__ it accumul __PUNCT__ as do the risk of it fall into the wrong hand __PUNCT__
todai there ar well over __NUM__ ton of separ plutonium in civilian stockpil around the world __PUNCT__
thi is a catastroph wait to happen __PUNCT__
we need to close down or phase out as mani of these facil as we can __PUNCT__ and rapidli secur all materi of potenti interest to terrorist __PUNCT__
negoti to accomplish thi will be veri difficult __PUNCT__ but a comprehens strategi to stop nuclear terror must __PUNCT__ at a minimum __PUNCT__ stop the construct of new facil that us bomb __PUNCT__ grade fuel __PUNCT__ and establish rigor intern secur standard and monitor procedur for those facil that alreadi exist __PUNCT__
our fourth task is to consolid all exist fissil materi __PUNCT__ and all futur uranium enrich and spent __PUNCT__ fuel dispos in a limit number of highli secur facil in the nuclear state __PUNCT__
uranium enrich for nuclear energi is inher danger __PUNCT__
it is too easi to convert into a weapon program __PUNCT__ and the more place it happen __PUNCT__ the more opportun there ar for terrorist to acquir fissil materi __PUNCT__
accordingli __PUNCT__ the nuclear weapon state should agre to an intern program that provid non __PUNCT__ nuclear weapon state with leu nuclear fuel at stabl price __PUNCT__ and which then receiv all spent fuel for dispos in a limit number of highli secur facil in the nuclear state __PUNCT__
such a program would elimin the econom rational for non __PUNCT__ nuclear weapon state to enrich their own uranium __PUNCT__
the obstacl to accomplish these multipli goal ar mani and intertwin __PUNCT__
to prevent nuclear terror we will need to overcom vest interest __PUNCT__ old suspicion and habit __PUNCT__ ideolog rigid __PUNCT__ religi and ethnic rivalri __PUNCT__ bureaucrat inertia and nation pride __PUNCT__
the onli wai to cut thi nuclear gordian knot __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__ will be through a focus global effort led by a unit state govern fulli commit to solv thi problem __PUNCT__ and will to listen as well as to talk __PUNCT__
and thi will requir american leader who recogn that the nuclear postur and polici which work in the last centuri will not work in thi new centuri __PUNCT__
some have said that nuclear terror is just inevit __PUNCT__ that we can never put the lid back on the pandora box of nuclear technolog __PUNCT__
thei ar right that we cannot turn back the clock __PUNCT__
but we can greatli reduc the risk of nuclear terror __PUNCT__ just as the __NUM__ the geneva protocol greatli reduc the us of chemic and biolog weapon __PUNCT__ and cold war arm talk reduc the threat of war between the us and the ussr __PUNCT__
we can prevent the ultim prevent catastroph if we have the courag to recogn and embrac the challeng __PUNCT__
thi is what the new realism is all about __PUNCT__
it about not deni danger __PUNCT__ but rather move forward to meet them __PUNCT__
it about recogn that time have chang __PUNCT__ that we live in a differ world than our parent did __PUNCT__ and that we must act decis if we wish to leav thi world intact to our children __PUNCT__
we need to look at the world through cool ey and see it for what it realli is __PUNCT__
but we also must have the vision and the optim and the courag to do what we can to make it a safer place __PUNCT__
