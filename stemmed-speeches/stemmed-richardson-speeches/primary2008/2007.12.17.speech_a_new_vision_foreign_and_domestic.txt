thank so much for have me here todai __PUNCT__
i have to sai __PUNCT__ i pretti impress with myself __PUNCT__ a presidenti candid who onli minut late __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ there realli onli on politician that the american peopl need to be on time __PUNCT__
and that in __NUM__ hour when georg bush ha to leav the white hous __PUNCT__
forev __PUNCT__
the next dai we start repair the damag and restor the american dream __PUNCT__
and the most import part of restor that dream is end the war in iraq __PUNCT__
in so mani wai __PUNCT__ it is the linchpin to everyth we want to do as a countri __PUNCT__
it is the kei to heal our divis and bring america togeth again __PUNCT__
it is the basi for restor american leadership around the world __PUNCT__
it is the foundat upon which we can rebuild our faith in american leader __PUNCT__
and it is the necessari first step for creat good job __PUNCT__ a qualiti educ system __PUNCT__ and a strong middl class __PUNCT__
some of my fellow candid have decid to stop talk about iraq __PUNCT__
their campaign strategi have shift to other issu __PUNCT__
over the last few debat and on the campaign trail __PUNCT__ our brave troop in iraq seem to have been forgotten __PUNCT__
i do believ that we need to talk about domest issu __PUNCT__
too mani american ar worri about keep their job and their home __PUNCT__
too mani american ar worri that their children ar not get the qualiti educ that thei need to compet in the world __PUNCT__
but the fact __URL__ cannot move forward on ani of these issu while our troop ar left behind in iraq __PUNCT__
some have said that we can chang america at home __PUNCT__ while we keep troop in iraq for perhap five year or longer __PUNCT__
that not an equat that add up __PUNCT__
it doesn't add up financi __PUNCT__
it doesn't add up moral __PUNCT__
it doesn't add up for america __PUNCT__
and let me sai that the nation media deserv it fair share of blame for forget our troop as well __PUNCT__
perhap thei think the casualti ar old new __PUNCT__
perhap thei think that cover silli food fight between candid will get them better rate __PUNCT__
perhap thei think that becaus fewer of our troop have di late __PUNCT__ that american don't care anymor __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we do __PUNCT__
and i dare the media to tell the famili of the __NUM__ troop who were kill last month that thi issu doesn't deserv front __PUNCT__ page coverag __PUNCT__
i think about a young man from la mesa __PUNCT__ new mexico name jame pirtl __PUNCT__ an armi specialist who serv in iraq __PUNCT__
on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ he wa kill in action __PUNCT__ he wa the first new mexican kill there __PUNCT__
and i think about hi mother __PUNCT__ who sent me a letter afterward ask me to make sure that her son sacrific for thi countri never be forgotten __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we will not forget __PUNCT__
the most import issu in thi race to decid who will go up against republican next fall is not some abstract notion of the word chang __PUNCT__
it not about who said what in kindergarten __PUNCT__
it not about past drug us __PUNCT__
it about our brave troop be kill in the middl of a civil war __PUNCT__
and it about who go to put an end to it __PUNCT__
my disagr with my oppon in thi race ar not person __PUNCT__
i refus to engag in neg charact attack __PUNCT__
but there is a profound differ on the war in iraq __PUNCT__
in a recent debat __PUNCT__ senat clinton __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ and senat edward were ask to pledg to have all our troop out by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__
thei would not do so __PUNCT__
i have made that pledg __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i will get them all out in under a year __PUNCT__
__NUM__ is over five year from now __PUNCT__
if we still have troop in iraq in __NUM__ the iraqi sure won't think the war is over __PUNCT__
and neither will the american peopl __PUNCT__
five more year of our brave troop be kill and wound __PUNCT__
i won't allow it __PUNCT__
our troop have done a magnific job __PUNCT__
thei deserv to come home __PUNCT__
senat clinton __PUNCT__ senat obama __PUNCT__ and senat edward ar sai it mai take them longer to end the war in iraq than it took fdr to win world war ii __PUNCT__
that not leadership __PUNCT__
we have to be bolder for the sake of our peopl in harm wai __PUNCT__
we can get out faster __PUNCT__
i tire of the naysay who sai we can't do it __PUNCT__
the expert know it __PUNCT__
i read the brief __PUNCT__
i talk to my militari advisor __PUNCT__
i know we can do __URL__ the american peopl know it too __PUNCT__
and we don't just wave goodby __PUNCT__
i call a reconcili confer to implement accord to end the war __PUNCT__
i establish an intern donor confer and build a un __PUNCT__ sanction predominantli muslim peacekeep forc __PUNCT__
that how we fix iraq __PUNCT__
but we can't do it until all of our troop ar on their wai out __PUNCT__
the death of our troop will not bring the parti togeth __PUNCT__
but diplomaci will __PUNCT__
i know it will becaus i work in the region __PUNCT__
as un ambassador __PUNCT__ i spent eighti percent of my time on iraq and the middl east __PUNCT__
as a special envoi __PUNCT__ i negoti with saddam hussein himself __PUNCT__
the bottom line is thi __PUNCT__ our presenc in iraq is block reconcili by the parti and fuel hatr of the unit state around the world __PUNCT__
we ar less safe stai in iraq than we ar leav __PUNCT__
we need to get our troop out in order to focu on our real secur need __PUNCT__ and upon our need at home __PUNCT__
if we get our troop out and give diplomaci a chanc __PUNCT__ then we can give educ a chanc __PUNCT__
we can give health care a chanc __PUNCT__
and we can give our economi a chanc __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we can't move forward on these issu __PUNCT__ becaus iraq is poison the relationship between congress and the presid __PUNCT__
domest invest ar be held hostag by republican who ar demand unfett war spend __PUNCT__
and thei ar be back up by a stubborn presid with noth to lose __PUNCT__
thei ar refus to move on ani of our countri urgent domest need __PUNCT__ until thei get billion of dollar in war monei __PUNCT__
just look at the last twelv month __PUNCT__
we still have nine million children with no health insur __PUNCT__
we still have the fail polici call no child left behind __PUNCT__
we still have no comprehens immigr reform __PUNCT__
we still have guantanamo and tortur and eavesdrop __PUNCT__
we still have too mani famili worri about lose their home to foreclosur __PUNCT__
the economi mai be slip into a recess __PUNCT__
million of american ar worri about their qualiti of life __PUNCT__
million of american no longer have faith in their govern __PUNCT__
thei elect thi congress to the end the war __PUNCT__
thei have not done so __PUNCT__
and thei see a presid more concern about hi legaci and hi pride than about end a war that continu to take too mani live and too mani billion of dollar __PUNCT__
we all know the terribl human cost of thi war __PUNCT__
some of america children __PUNCT__ who will know their father and mother onli through pictur and newspap stori __PUNCT__
know those cost all too well __PUNCT__
but it is also clear that there ha been a grievou financi cost to our countri __PUNCT__
we spent __MONEY__ billion dollar on thi war alreadi __PUNCT__
the war true cost could be closer to __NUM__ trillion dollar __NUM__ when you look at disabl care for our wound vet __PUNCT__
and make no mistak __PUNCT__ those return from iraq absolut must get the best care __PUNCT__
closer to two trillion dollar when you consid that instabl in the middl east caus by the war ha driven oil price close to a hundr dollar a barrel __PUNCT__
and that not an abstract number for famili here in iowa try to keep their home warm thi winter __PUNCT__
closer to two trillion dollar when you consid the econom product that ha vanish becaus of the live lost to thi war __PUNCT__
think of what we could have done with two trillion dollar __PUNCT__ we could have had univers health care __PUNCT__
we could have fulli fund social secur for gener __PUNCT__
we could have rais the salari of everi teacher in america __PUNCT__
we could have been well on our wai to energi independ __PUNCT__
just two week of the iraq war cost us more than we spend on cancer research in a whole year __PUNCT__
now think of what we will fail to __URL__ we stai in iraq for anoth five year __PUNCT__ as some of my democrat colleagu ar will to do __PUNCT__
or even decad as some republican have said we must do __PUNCT__
it time for a new vision __PUNCT__
thi vision is not a republican dream __PUNCT__
it not a democrat dream __PUNCT__
it not a black dream __PUNCT__
it not a brown dream __PUNCT__
it not a white dream __PUNCT__
it not a poor dream __PUNCT__
it not a rich dream __PUNCT__
it an american dream __PUNCT__ in which all of our troop ar come home __PUNCT__
in which our govern work for the middl class __PUNCT__
to those who sai our student can't do ani better __PUNCT__ i sai thei can __PUNCT__
i have a sixti __PUNCT__ billion dollar plan to improv educ from pre __PUNCT__ k to colleg and beyond __PUNCT__
on no child left behind __PUNCT__ i don't think __PUNCT__ reform __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ tweak __PUNCT__ it is enough __PUNCT__
i think we need to be bolder __PUNCT__
i would scrap it __PUNCT__
we need to rais teacher salari and focu on scienc and math __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i would set a new nation goal __PUNCT__ that american student be number on in scienc and math within __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
part of that is put art back into the school __PUNCT__
art and music help kid with math and scienc __PUNCT__
i know we can do it becaus in my state __PUNCT__ we rais teacher salari __PUNCT__ establish a statewid pre __PUNCT__ k program __PUNCT__ and made colleg more afford __PUNCT__
to those who sai we can't beat the lobbi and pass health care reform __PUNCT__ i know we can __PUNCT__ becaus i did it __PUNCT__
all kid twelv and under in my state todai have access to health insur __PUNCT__ and we ar go cover everyon els by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ everi famili will have access to the same health insur that congress and the presid have __PUNCT__ and our veteran will have a hero health card so that thei can the care thei deserv wherev thei need it __PUNCT__
we go to requir full __PUNCT__ mandatori fund of the va health care system __PUNCT__
and we go to start treat mental trauma such as ptsd the same wai we treat physic wound __PUNCT__ like the battlefield injuri that thei ar __PUNCT__
and we ar go to do right by the famili of the men and women serv in our nation arm forc __PUNCT__
our militari famili make enorm sacrific everydai on behalf of the nation __PUNCT__
it is not uncommon that spous and parent ar forc to leav their job to care for their return wound __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will offer up to on year of paid disabl insur for the famili member who leav a job to care for an injur veteran __PUNCT__
to those who sai we can't creat high __PUNCT__ qualiti job here in america anymor __PUNCT__ i sai we can __PUNCT__
when i took offic as governor __PUNCT__ new mexico economi had stall __PUNCT__
moral wa low __PUNCT__
we had no thrive industri __PUNCT__ no plan for growth and a tax polici that discourag invest and job creation __PUNCT__
so i pass a tax credit for compani to creat job that pai abov the prevail wage __PUNCT__
we pass a perman rural job tax credit __PUNCT__
we enact a three __PUNCT__ year tax holidai for high __PUNCT__ tech startup __PUNCT__
rather than us tax cut to reward the wealthi __PUNCT__
i us them to reward put peopl to work __PUNCT__
i focus on growth industri like clean energi __PUNCT__ wind and solar __PUNCT__ aviat and high tech __PUNCT__
we end up creat over __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
we have the lowest unemploy rate in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and we seventh in the nation for incom growth __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ we ar the democrat parti __PUNCT__
we stand for job __PUNCT__
we stand for the right of work american __PUNCT__
and we stand for fair and opportun __PUNCT__
and we can never forget that __PUNCT__
it why i proud to offer the most detail job plan of ani candid for presid __PUNCT__
and i proud to be the onli democrat in thi race with a record of creat job and turn an economi around __PUNCT__
i know that we can do the same thing across the countri __PUNCT__
i __URL__ in iowa i see peopl who haven't given up on the american dream __PUNCT__
despit the failur in washington __PUNCT__ i see peopl more commit than ever to give their kid a better life than thei had __PUNCT__
restor the strength of our economi is go to requir fiscal respons __PUNCT__
the singl most fiscal irrespons act in american histori ha been georg bush unfund war in iraq __PUNCT__
balanc the budget is invest in the futur __PUNCT__
it mean that we ar pai for what we get todai __PUNCT__ so our children don't have to __PUNCT__
and that why i support a constitut amend to balanc the budget __PUNCT__
and a line __PUNCT__ item veto __PUNCT__
we allow the republican to spend recklessli for too long __PUNCT__
i know how to balanc a budget __PUNCT__ i done it five time as governor __PUNCT__
i also know that in a __NUM__ centuri economi __PUNCT__ govern must act as a partner to help unleash the innov and the job creation potenti of the privat sector __PUNCT__
i will restor and increas fund for feder research and develop program __PUNCT__
i will creat a feder angel investor tax credit to encourag invest in high __PUNCT__ tech startup __PUNCT__
and i will make perman and doubl the research and experiment tax credit __PUNCT__
we must provid incent for invest in cut __PUNCT__ edg research and manufactur __PUNCT__
while we build for the futur and repair the damag of the past __PUNCT__ we must also invest in our peopl now __PUNCT__
we need to move aggress to creat high __PUNCT__ qualiti job and expand econom opportun __PUNCT__
the american dream ha alwai been big __PUNCT__ big enough for all of us __PUNCT__
but for too mani these dai __PUNCT__ the dream is shrink and shut them out __PUNCT__
that is unaccept __PUNCT__
everi american deserv the opportun to succe __PUNCT__
we need to get back to big dream and bold idea __PUNCT__
in addit to creat new high __PUNCT__ qualiti job __PUNCT__ we need to preserv the on we alreadi have __PUNCT__
we should restor america focu on protect our labor forc __PUNCT__
i have stood with work men and women who belong to labor union my entir career __PUNCT__
thei plai a vital role in advanc the right of american worker __PUNCT__
a union job mean a good __PUNCT__ pai __URL__ good benefit __PUNCT__
i believ employe and worker have a fundament right to organ and bargain collect __PUNCT__ which is why the second bill i sign as governor restor collect bargain right to new mexico public employe __PUNCT__
we negoti the first project labor agreement in my state histori __PUNCT__ and we made our prevail wage a union wage __PUNCT__
and when i am presid __PUNCT__ my secretari of labor will be a union member __PUNCT__ and i will fire all the union __PUNCT__ bust lawyer at the nlrb __PUNCT__
and i will push for and sign the employe free choic act __PUNCT__
we must move beyond the tire debat over __PUNCT__ free trade __PUNCT__ versu __PUNCT__ protection __PUNCT__
instead we have to roll up our sleev and pursu better trade agreement __PUNCT__ agreement that enhanc rather than erod u. __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__
washington ha fail to help famili with the rise cost of live __PUNCT__
expens for health care __PUNCT__ child care __PUNCT__ and a colleg educ ar rise faster than wage __PUNCT__
our next presid must focu on make these more afford __PUNCT__
and the war in iraq ha help push oil price through the roof __PUNCT__
the price of keep a home warm is a terribl pressur on american famili __PUNCT__
our nation strength is our peopl __PUNCT__ and we must do whatev it take to protect that resourc __PUNCT__
now is a time for bold leadership __PUNCT__
washington should not be bicker while our troop ar dy in the field __PUNCT__
the next presid is go to have to bring thi countri togeth __PUNCT__
think of our troop in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
thei do not serv as democrat or as republican __PUNCT__ thei serv as american __PUNCT__
we must do the same here at home __PUNCT__
but thi war ha divid us __PUNCT__
