nearli six year ago __PUNCT__ __NUM__ al qaeda terrorist commit the largest mass murder in our countri histori __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ more than __NUM__ dai later __PUNCT__ those who organ __NUM__ hide along the pakistan/afghanistan border __PUNCT__
our intellig agenc tell us that al qaeda todai is more diffus and danger than ever __PUNCT__
al qaeda is not the onli terrorist group __PUNCT__
but it is uniqu __PUNCT__ it ha declar war on america __PUNCT__ it ha attack us on our soil __PUNCT__ and it continu to plan anoth spectacular domest attack like __NUM__ or wors __PUNCT__
the leader of al qaeda sai thei wish to kill __NUM__ million american __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ million children __PUNCT__
in their mad __PUNCT__ thei claim that such a slaughter of innoc would __PUNCT__ balanc the scale of justic __PUNCT__ for crime that thei alleg we have commit against muslim __PUNCT__
we would be mad not to take them at their word __PUNCT__
so i want to focu my comment todai on what we need to do to defeat al qaeda __PUNCT__
that is not to ignor other group __PUNCT__
inde much of what we do to destroi al qaeda will help defeat other terrorist __PUNCT__
rather __PUNCT__ it is to recogn what thi administr seem never to have understood __PUNCT__ the uniqu danger pose to our countri by al qaeda and it sympath __PUNCT__
al qaeda first attack america in __NUM__ in east africa __PUNCT__
month befor that attack __PUNCT__ presid clinton sent me to afghanistan to press the taliban to hand over osama bin laden __PUNCT__
thei refus __PUNCT__
so we impos tough un sanction on them __PUNCT__
when the bush administr came into offic thei seem not to understand how seriou the threat we face wa __PUNCT__
thei ignor dire warn from the cia and other terrorist expert __PUNCT__
the __DATE__ presidenti daili brief read __PUNCT__ bin laden determin to strike in us __PUNCT__
the presid fail to understand what thi meant __PUNCT__
after __DATE__ __PUNCT__ he seem final to get it __PUNCT__
i support the liber of afghanistan __PUNCT__
i had seen with my own ey the taliban repress of women __PUNCT__ their paranoid intoler of all dissent and all divers __PUNCT__
i knew thei were unlik to respond to reason __PUNCT__
if onli the presid had kept hi ey on the ball and finish the job when he had the chanc __PUNCT__
al qaeda wa on the rope in __NUM__ corner in the badland between afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
if our troop had been given the resourc thei need __PUNCT__ we could have finish them off __PUNCT__
but the presid chose instead to divert our resourc from that necessari war to a war of choic __PUNCT__
we know that there wa no al qaeda in iraq befor __NUM__ and no iraqi connect to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
extens studi by the __NUM__ commiss and other ha confirm that __PUNCT__
even the presid admit it __PUNCT__
and we know now that iraq had no wmd __PUNCT__
iraq divert critic intellig and militari resourc from the fight against al qaeda __PUNCT__
we let up the pressur and al qaeda recov __PUNCT__ and struck back __PUNCT__
sinc __NUM__ al qaeda and it affili have carri out attack in algier __PUNCT__ casablanca __PUNCT__ madrid __PUNCT__ london __PUNCT__ istanbul __PUNCT__ riyadh __PUNCT__ tel aviv __PUNCT__ jeddah __PUNCT__ karachi __PUNCT__ sharm al shaykh __PUNCT__ taba __PUNCT__ mombassa __PUNCT__ kuwait __PUNCT__ mumbai __PUNCT__ new delhi __PUNCT__ dacca __PUNCT__ bali and elsewher __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ the presid reject the sage advic of those who argu that we need a care plan for what to do after we reach baghdad __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ bush did not have a plan __PUNCT__
but al qaeda did __PUNCT__
after the us invas __PUNCT__ it sent fighter to iraq with the goal of provok a civil war __PUNCT__
it carri out hundr of attack on shia shrine __PUNCT__ leader and innoc to provok the sectarian bloodbath we face todai __PUNCT__
it wa an evil plan __PUNCT__ but a predict on __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ lost in hi delus of an easi peac __PUNCT__ presid bush did not figur out what wa happen until it wa too late __PUNCT__
iraq wa now in a civil war __PUNCT__ and there wa noth we could do to stop it __PUNCT__
so the result todai is an al qaeda which is more diffus and more deadli than ever __PUNCT__
it ha a stronghold in south asia and a boom franchis in iraq __PUNCT__
it is rais so much monei in iraq that it cannot spend it all there __PUNCT__ and it us it to fund other oper around the world __PUNCT__
and sooner or later al qaeda will attack america at home again __PUNCT__
we have alreadi foil plot to do so __PUNCT__
we know that thei take their time __PUNCT__ and slowli and method plan and then execut spectacular attack __PUNCT__
we know thei have tri to acquir nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
our fbi director sai he stai up at night worri about an al qaeda nuclear attack on america __PUNCT__
we need to address thi threat with the focu it deserv __PUNCT__
we need a grand strategi for defeat al qaeda __PUNCT__
the past five year have demonstr that a primarili militari strategi will not work __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ the botch occup of iraq ha plai into the hand of the jihadist __PUNCT__ bolster their propaganda that the us want to kill muslim __PUNCT__ and that we want to control the muslim world to exploit it resourc __PUNCT__
never ha america been as unpopular as it is todai __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ and in mani other muslim countri __PUNCT__ poll show that our credibl ha plummet __PUNCT__
as a direct result of the iraq occup __PUNCT__ larg major of muslim now sai thei distrust america __PUNCT__
such sentiment facilit jihadist recruit and boost their popular support __PUNCT__
a new grand strategi against the qaeda movement must repair thi damag that the bush polici have done to our intern reput __PUNCT__
in particular __PUNCT__ we need to reach out to muslim __PUNCT__ and demonstr __PUNCT__ by our action as well as our word __PUNCT__ that we respect muslim cultur and valu muslim life __PUNCT__
we need to earn back our alli __PUNCT__ confid in american leadership __PUNCT__ and diplomat resolv the conflict that fuel al qaeda recruit in the muslim world __PUNCT__
we must overcom those who call for the destruct of israel __PUNCT__ and achiev a just __PUNCT__ two __PUNCT__ state solut which guarante israel secur __PUNCT__
intellig effort need to focu on the al qaeda leadership __PUNCT__ and on break up cell befor thei act __PUNCT__
thi will requir more human intellig and more arab __PUNCT__ speak expert __PUNCT__ as well as better intellig coordin with our alli and arab friend __PUNCT__
the target of our militari strategi need to be the al qaeda leadership __PUNCT__
as long as these men ar activ __PUNCT__ thei symbol the success of resist to america __PUNCT__ and attract new recruit __PUNCT__
it is not good enough to have them __PUNCT__ hide in cave __PUNCT__
the death or captur of osama bin ladin and hi associ in pakistan and afghanistan will not end the al qaeda movement __PUNCT__ but it will deal it a seriou setback __PUNCT__
so how do we do it __PUNCT__ a critic first step is to enhanc our commit __PUNCT__ militari __PUNCT__ polit and econom __PUNCT__ to afghanistan __PUNCT__
to defeat the resurg taliban will requir a signific increas in nato forc along the afghanistan __PUNCT__ pakistan border __PUNCT__ and that will requir american leadership __PUNCT__
we urgent must redirect our militari effort awai from iraq __PUNCT__ where al qaeda leadership is not locat __PUNCT__ and toward the afghanistan __PUNCT__ pakistan border __PUNCT__ where thei ar locat __PUNCT__
when our alli see that we have final gotten our prioriti straight __PUNCT__ that we have reviv our commit to go after the al qaeda leadership where it is __PUNCT__ onli then will thei provid enough troop and equip to overwhelm the enemi __PUNCT__
it is also critic that we engag muslim countri in thi effort __PUNCT__ to the extent that the troop root out al qaeda and the taliban ar muslim __PUNCT__ the jihadist cannot portrai the effort to defeat them as on of __PUNCT__ the west against islam __PUNCT__
the us therefor should encourag our muslim and arab partner __PUNCT__ especi egypt __PUNCT__ jordan __PUNCT__ tunisia __PUNCT__ algeria and morocco __PUNCT__ to offer troop to help stabil afghanistan __PUNCT__
nato should creat a contact group __PUNCT__ led by a senior nato diplomat __PUNCT__ to engag all of afghanistan neighbor on border stabil __PUNCT__ especi along the __NUM__ mile long pakistan border __PUNCT__
thi group should includ iran and india __PUNCT__
we need a much bigger econom reconstruct program for afghanistan __PUNCT__
humanitarian and econom aid foster goodwil and bolster support for our effort __PUNCT__
noth is more effect against our enemi than the memori of american aid worker who save a child or rebuilt a villag after an earthquak or a tsunami __PUNCT__
save afghanistan will requir a multilater marshal plan __PUNCT__ an effort on the scale of what rebuilt europ after the second world war __PUNCT__
the us should lead a coalit to rebuild thi countri that ha been ravag by three decad of war __PUNCT__
russia __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ europ __PUNCT__ india and other should contribut __PUNCT__
such a marshal plan must includ a program to provid all afghan children with educ and free lunch __PUNCT__
too mani children fall into the hand of islam school __PUNCT__ some of which teach violenc __PUNCT__ becaus it is their onli educ option __PUNCT__
the long __PUNCT__ term defeat of al qaeda depend on teach hope __PUNCT__ rather than hate __PUNCT__ to the next gener __PUNCT__
these effort also must extend into pakistan __PUNCT__
the border region ar poverti __PUNCT__ stricken breed ground for jihad __PUNCT__
we need to read the riot act to dick chenei pal __PUNCT__ presid musharraf __PUNCT__
we have provid him with __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__ in mostli militari aid __PUNCT__
futur aid must be link to a real crackdown on terrorist __PUNCT__ includ arab __PUNCT__ afghan and kashmiri __PUNCT__
musharraf also doesn't seem to care much for democraci __PUNCT__
we need to insist that pakistan have free elect thi year __PUNCT__
some have argu that democraci could bring radic islamist to power __PUNCT__
that is nonsens __PUNCT__
poll show that most pakistani favor the mainstream parti __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ the narrow polit base of the musharraf govern is a kei reason why the taliban and al qaeda ar grow in influenc __PUNCT__
pakistan need a repres govern and a free and vibrant civil societi __PUNCT__ if it is to resist the siren call of the jihadist __PUNCT__
iraq is also a critic battlefield in the fight against jihad __PUNCT__ becaus it prevent us from fulli engag the core al qaeda leadership in afghanistan and pakistan __PUNCT__
our enemi want us to remain bog down in iraq __PUNCT__
let me sai that again __PUNCT__ al qaeda benefit from our be trap in iraq __PUNCT__ and want us to stai there __PUNCT__
thei know that if we were not stuck in iraq __PUNCT__ we could go after them where thei ar __PUNCT__
thei know that the shia and the kurd in iraq don't want them there __PUNCT__ and that mani sunni iraqi toler them onli becaus thei ar alli against us __PUNCT__
when we leav __PUNCT__ thei know the iraqi will drive them out of iraq __PUNCT__
we cannot defeat al qaeda until we get out of iraq __PUNCT__
an orderli __PUNCT__ phase and complet troop withdraw could be complet rapidli __PUNCT__ and it is imper that it be complet __PUNCT__
the kei to an exit strategi is to exit __PUNCT__
we don't need a south korea __PUNCT__ like solut as the presid suggest __PUNCT__ an open __PUNCT__ end militari base in iraq that will alien succeed gener of iraqi and other muslim __PUNCT__
thi mondai sandi berger and bruce riedel wrote an op __PUNCT__ ed in the financi time that endors thi posit __PUNCT__
thei wrote __PUNCT__ a clear u. __PUNCT__ commit to a complet __PUNCT__ irrevers withdraw from iraq mai now be the onli wai to develop a region concert of power that could work with iraqi to try to stabil the countri and cauter the conflict __PUNCT__
more and more ar agre with me __PUNCT__
we must remov all of our troop __PUNCT__
i hope congress will de __PUNCT__ author thi war and forc presid bush to start bring them out thi year __PUNCT__
the sooner we ar out of iraq __PUNCT__ the sooner we can begin to win the real war against the real terrorist who attack thi countri on __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we cannot win the war against al qaeda alon __PUNCT__
it is urgent that we rebuild our allianc __PUNCT__ so that we can onc again lead other nation __PUNCT__
trust is critic to get alli to work with us in the secret world of counter terror and in the open world of public diplomaci __PUNCT__
thi administr ha driven awai our alli with swagger and saber rattl __PUNCT__
i will rebuild our allianc by make common caus with partner who share our valu and interest __PUNCT__
we also need to win the war of idea with al qaeda __PUNCT__
simpli call for democraci is not enough __PUNCT__ becaus action speak louder than word __PUNCT__
and the action of the bush administr have not match it rhetor __PUNCT__
militari tactic which have result in the death of thousand of civilian have fed the percept __PUNCT__ fan by the jihadist __PUNCT__ propaganda __PUNCT__ that we don't care about muslim life __PUNCT__
human right abus at abu ghraib __PUNCT__ guantanamo and elsewher have sulli our reput __PUNCT__
when peopl see these imag __PUNCT__ thei associ america not with human right and freedom __PUNCT__ but rather with secret prison and tortur __PUNCT__
america is better than the bush __PUNCT__ chenei administr __PUNCT__
if we want to win the war of idea __PUNCT__ we need to return to our proud tradit as a countri that respect human right __PUNCT__
i have spoken befor of the ideolog war that is go on in the islam world todai between fanat like bin laden and moder like jordan king abdullah and morocco king muhammad __PUNCT__ who have a progress view of islam __PUNCT__
we need to stand by these leader in their effort to defeat extrem __PUNCT__
as presid i will person engag in a new middl east peac process __PUNCT__ and i will make achiev a two __PUNCT__ state solut my highest diplomat prioriti __PUNCT__
presid clinton came veri close to a deal in __NUM__ and the bush administr disengag for six year allow the situat to drift and degener __PUNCT__
to revers thi damag __PUNCT__ as presid i would appoint a full __PUNCT__ time high __PUNCT__ level envoi dedic to improv our relationship with the muslim world __PUNCT__
thi person would be fluent in the cultur __PUNCT__ languag and custom of the arab street __PUNCT__ and serv as an attaché help to bridg the divid the bush administr fail polici have help to creat __PUNCT__
the presid should also us our enhanc relationship with india in the wake of the nuclear deal sign last year to encourag the nascent indo __PUNCT__ pakistani dialogu __PUNCT__
kashmir is kei to break the pakistani connect to terror __PUNCT__
i have been to islamabad and i have listen to pakistani leader plead with america to do someth about kashmir __PUNCT__
it is a caus which fuel resent of the west in their countri __PUNCT__ and push peopl to support terrorist __PUNCT__
the time for prevent diplomaci on the subcontin is now __PUNCT__ while pakistan and india ar talk to each other __PUNCT__
homeland secur we also must address homeland secur much more strateg than we have __PUNCT__
a biolog or nuclear attack could be as horrif as hiroshima __PUNCT__ and terror expert agre that sooner or later such an attack is like __PUNCT__
we must do everyth we can to prevent thi __PUNCT__ and we must improv our abil to respond quickli if an attack occur __PUNCT__ to assist the victim __PUNCT__ and to recov __PUNCT__
a strong civil defens system is essenti not just to save live after an attack __PUNCT__ but also to help prevent attack __PUNCT__
that is becaus __PUNCT__ to the extent that we can surviv and rebuild __PUNCT__ rather than panic __PUNCT__ the attack lose some of it militari valu to the terrorist __PUNCT__
thi is what expert call __PUNCT__ resili __PUNCT__
accordingli __PUNCT__ we must rememb that civil defens measur ar not just plai defens __PUNCT__
thei ar essenti compon of a grand strategi to defeat al qaeda __PUNCT__
state and local govern have role to plai in homeland secur __PUNCT__
in new mexico we have taken mani step to make our citizen more secur __PUNCT__
we pass a statewid mutual aid law so that commun can assist on anoth without bureaucrat red tape __PUNCT__ and we made emerg manag and homeland secur an independ __PUNCT__ cabinet __PUNCT__ level depart __PUNCT__
we also establish a robust border secur program __PUNCT__ and establish a fund stream to help border commun polic more effect __PUNCT__
we pass a law provid job protect to volunt emerg respond __PUNCT__ and we increas supplement life insur for our nation guard __PUNCT__
but protect american citizen from terrorist attack is fundament the respons of the feder govern __PUNCT__
onli the feder govern can protect our border and our port __PUNCT__ fund cut __PUNCT__ edg technolog __PUNCT__ and undertak mani other function that need to be done at the nation and intern level __PUNCT__
while the bush administr ha taken some measur to improv secur __PUNCT__ particularli of air travel __PUNCT__ there ar mani thing which __PUNCT__ nearli six year after __NUM__ __PUNCT__ have not been done to protect the american peopl __PUNCT__
by far __PUNCT__ the most urgent thing we must do __PUNCT__ and ar not do __PUNCT__ is to vastli improv the surg capac of our public health system __PUNCT__ so that we can respond quickli and effect to a nuclear or biolog attack __PUNCT__
thi administr ha neglect to fund the modern of our abil to take care of american and to recov from an attack at home __PUNCT__
we must revers thi __PUNCT__
we should build mobil hospit that can be brought quickli wherev thei ar need __PUNCT__ and we should stockpil equip __PUNCT__ medicin and vaccin __PUNCT__ and equip standbi hospit __PUNCT__
the feder govern need to provid fund so that everi commun ha an effect disast manag system __PUNCT__ as well as reliabl commun system among all first respond and medic facil __PUNCT__
and we urgent must train more doctor __PUNCT__ paramed and __PUNCT__ especi __PUNCT__ nurs for disast and terror respons __PUNCT__
such personnel __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ can also help improv health care deliveri everi dai to underserv popul __PUNCT__
the feder govern can make thi happen with a medic gi bill __PUNCT__ a scholarship program for nurs and other medic specialist __PUNCT__
a medic gi bill would provid full scholarship in exchang for a commit to serv in poor and rural area __PUNCT__ and to particip in nation disast respons __PUNCT__
we need to be abl to produc larg amount of vaccin for new diseas __PUNCT__ quickli __PUNCT__
flu vaccin ar still manufactur the same wai thei have been for decad __PUNCT__ us egg __PUNCT__ and must be made for specif strain of diseas __PUNCT__
the feder govern can help with more fund for cell __PUNCT__ base vaccin manufactur and recombin dna vaccin __PUNCT__
we also need risk __PUNCT__ base fund for homeland secur __PUNCT__ it is unpatriot for legisl to turn homeland secur dollar into pork __PUNCT__
we need to spend homeland secur fund where thei ar need __PUNCT__ in high __PUNCT__ risk urban area like new york __PUNCT__ chicago __PUNCT__ and la __PUNCT__
we know al qaeda ha sought nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and that if thei obtain them thei will us them with the same ruthless with which thei flew airplan fill with peopl into build fill with peopl __PUNCT__
i have spoken at length elsewher about how to prevent thi __PUNCT__ ultim prevent catastroph __PUNCT__
prevent a terrorist nuclear attack requir urgent action on mani front __PUNCT__ first and foremost __PUNCT__ we must keep nuclear materi out of the hand of terrorist __PUNCT__ both through counter __PUNCT__ prolifer __PUNCT__ and by secur all fission materi worldwid __PUNCT__
thi is a huge task __PUNCT__ but not an imposs on __PUNCT__
the unit state must lead a comprehens global effort to secur all nuclear weapon and all nuclear fuel and spent fuel __PUNCT__
thi is the onli wai to keep nuke out of the wrong hand __PUNCT__
good thing alreadi have been done __PUNCT__ such as the nunn __PUNCT__ lugar program and doe materi protect __PUNCT__ control and account program __PUNCT__
but we must do more to secur nuclear arsen __PUNCT__ abov all those of russia and pakistan __PUNCT__
now that we ar final talk to the north korean __PUNCT__ we need to make sure that thei desist from traffick and that thei realli dismantl their nuke __PUNCT__
and we must not relent in lead intern effort to stop iran nuclear enrich program __PUNCT__ with diplomaci combin tough sanction and posit incent __PUNCT__
and we need a global fuel __PUNCT__ bank arrang that insur that nuclear fuel is enrich and spent __PUNCT__ fuel is dispos of in a limit number of highli __PUNCT__ secur site __PUNCT__
such a comprehens and global diplomat effort to secur the nuclear materi al qaeda want must be a top prioriti of the next presid __PUNCT__
as a former energi secretari __PUNCT__ i understand the urgenc of thi __PUNCT__
as a diplomat and former us ambassador to the un __PUNCT__ i believ we can do it __PUNCT__
we also need to prevent nuclear weapon from get past our border __PUNCT__ not with wall __PUNCT__ but with vastli improv detect effort on the canadian and mexican border __PUNCT__ at our sea and land port __PUNCT__ and on the high sea __PUNCT__
thi will take major invest in technolog __PUNCT__ intellig gather and personnel __PUNCT__ includ nation guard and border secur __PUNCT__
but it is need to interdict nuclear weapon or materi terrorist will try to smuggl into the countri __PUNCT__
america can and will defeat al qaeda __PUNCT__
becaus at the end of the dai the vast major of muslim do not share their twist vision of jihad __PUNCT__
and with the right american leadership __PUNCT__ the world will follow us as we put these peopl out of busi __PUNCT__
we need leadership that understand the natur of the enemi __PUNCT__ and focus on the real terrorist who attack us on __NUM__ __PUNCT__
leadership that recogn that we must lead by exampl __PUNCT__ that our deed must match our word __PUNCT__ and that we ar strongest __PUNCT__ and safest __PUNCT__ when we us all of our resourc __PUNCT__ militari __PUNCT__ econom __PUNCT__ diplomat __PUNCT__ humanitarian and polit __PUNCT__
with thi kind of leadership __PUNCT__ and with a comprehens global strategi __PUNCT__ we can and will defeat al qaeda __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
