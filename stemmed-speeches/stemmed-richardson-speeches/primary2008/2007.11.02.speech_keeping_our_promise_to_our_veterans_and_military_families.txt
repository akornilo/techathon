thank you for your servic to our nation __PUNCT__
when the presid ask our militari men and women to put themselv in harm wai halfwai around the world __PUNCT__ we do not expect hesit __PUNCT__
we expect the honor choru of __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ sir __PUNCT__ ye ma'am __PUNCT__ for flag __PUNCT__ for countri __PUNCT__ for the defens of freedom __PUNCT__
we expect that while we tend to the everydai busi of our nativ soil __PUNCT__ there ar those who have chosen a differ path __PUNCT__
there ar those who will leav their famili to protect our __PUNCT__
there ar those that carri the proud promis of a righteou defens __PUNCT__
pass down from vallei forg to iwo jima to inchon to hue to todai in the mountain of afghanistan and the desert of iraq __PUNCT__
thi solemn tradit of servic ha stood unbroken for nearli a quarter millennium __PUNCT__
not simpli becaus of a share uniform or joint drill __PUNCT__
thi tradit is bond by a common faith that human digniti and democrat freedom ar worth fight for __PUNCT__
thi promis of protect is kept aliv by gener of courag servicemen and women __PUNCT__
it is a promis that doe not and should not come cheap __PUNCT__
when our troop salut and ship out oversea __PUNCT__ thei ar keep their promis of servic to our nation __PUNCT__
it about time we kept our nation promis to them __PUNCT__
it about time that we said __PUNCT__ ye soldier __PUNCT__ ye sailor __PUNCT__ ye airman __PUNCT__ ye marin __PUNCT__
you and your famili ar entitl to the best health care __PUNCT__
the best benefit __PUNCT__
to the best our nation ha to offer __PUNCT__
presid bush ha fail again and again to keep up hi part of thi promis __PUNCT__
while ask for more and more from our troop and their famili __PUNCT__
he ha given them less and less __PUNCT__
and hi failur ar even more insidi becaus thei ar too often unseen __PUNCT__
the presid ha block out pictur of the flag __PUNCT__ drape coffin come home from afghanistan and iraq __PUNCT__
we do not see our maim vet march in parad __PUNCT__ onli in the occasion new expos√© of decrepit condit __PUNCT__
by now we all seen the disgrac condit at walter reed __PUNCT__
but too few of us have heard about the mental trauma suffer by so mani return combat veteran __PUNCT__
too few have felt the anxieti of militari famili across the countri that can't make end meet while a love on is serv abroad __PUNCT__
put simpli __PUNCT__ the presid ha hidden awai the heroism of our fight men and women __PUNCT__
he ha trade in our troop __PUNCT__ health care for tax cut __PUNCT__ and he ha trade on our veteran __PUNCT__ servic for vote __PUNCT__
it long past time that end __PUNCT__
it long past time we said __PUNCT__ never in america __PUNCT__
never again __PUNCT__
it is the sacr duti of ani command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief to take care of hi or her troop __PUNCT__
and i swear to you that when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will not rest until the promis we made to our veteran and our militari famili is fulfil __PUNCT__
the first step is get all of our troop out of iraq __PUNCT__
all our troop __PUNCT__ with no residu forc left behind __PUNCT__
onli when we make it clear that we ar leav can we expect the iraqi to make the tough choic necessari for reconcili __PUNCT__
onli when all of our troop ar on their wai out __PUNCT__ will other in the region do what thei must to prevent iraq from collaps __PUNCT__
onli our departur will give us the credibl to conven a dayton __PUNCT__ style confer to build a power __PUNCT__ share arrang polic by multilater __PUNCT__ un __PUNCT__ sanction peacekeep __PUNCT__
hillari clinton __PUNCT__ barack obama and john edward have said we have to wait and see how thing go befor we can know how mani troop to bring out and how quickli __PUNCT__
i sai there ha been enough wait and see __PUNCT__
if you haven't seen enough to know that we need to get all the troop out then you aren't watch the same war that i and the rest of america ar see __PUNCT__
senat clinton and obama __PUNCT__ when directli ask __PUNCT__ refus to commit to get all u. __PUNCT__ troop out by __NUM__ __PUNCT__
ten of thousand could remain in iraq through __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and senat clinton said she might have troop in iraq at the end of her second term __PUNCT__
leav troop is just chang the mission __PUNCT__ we need to end thi war and while i respect my democrat colleagu __PUNCT__ their plan simpli will not end thi war __PUNCT__
how mani more mother and father __PUNCT__ brother and sister __PUNCT__ wive __PUNCT__ husband __PUNCT__ and children must lose their love on befor we get our troop out of the crossfir __PUNCT__ how mani more of our young peopl will die befor we recogn that our troop cannot win someon els civil war __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ brave american have lost their live __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ have been wound __PUNCT__
countless more suffer the lone anguish of mental trauma __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ the administr ha shut it ey to the scar and close it ear to the cri for help __PUNCT__
it is absolut unaccept __PUNCT__
our veteran fought the enemi abroad __PUNCT__
thei should not have to fight their govern at home to get the health care thei have earn over and over again __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ almost __NUM__ million veteran ar uninsur __PUNCT__
that is not right __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ all veteran will be offer a hero __PUNCT__ health card __PUNCT__
if it inconveni for them to get to a va hospit or clinic __PUNCT__ you know where thei can get care __PUNCT__ wherev thei need it __PUNCT__
while we expand choic __PUNCT__ we also need to make sure that the va system is the strongest it can be __PUNCT__
i will guarante full mandatori fund for the va __PUNCT__
no more year __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ discretionari fund __PUNCT__
no more polit calcul __PUNCT__
no more game __PUNCT__
the health of our veteran is not option __PUNCT__
the fund must be mandatori __PUNCT__
when we send our troop into harm wai __PUNCT__ we do not ask how much it will cost __PUNCT__
when thei come home wound __PUNCT__ we should not ask __PUNCT__ how much will that cost __PUNCT__ the answer to both question is the same __PUNCT__
whatev it take __PUNCT__
it is essenti that we fix walter reed and the rest of our militari hospit __PUNCT__
the condit that we saw at walter reed were an insult to our veteran and an embarrass to our nation __PUNCT__
the presid should have stood up and taken respons __PUNCT__
he should have said __PUNCT__ the buck stop with me __PUNCT__
thi will be fix __PUNCT__
he didn't __PUNCT__
instead we saw anoth game of washington music chair __PUNCT__
and when the music stop __PUNCT__ the presid scrambl to find himself a comfort place to sit __PUNCT__ well out of the wai __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ when i am presid i will never sit back and watch our veteran suffer __PUNCT__
i will requir a regular brief from the militari senior medic gener offic on the statu of our nation medic facil __PUNCT__
i will stand up __PUNCT__ out front __PUNCT__
everi dai for our fight men and women and their famili __PUNCT__
we all know that when our troop ship out __PUNCT__ thei do not serv alon __PUNCT__
their famili serv with them __PUNCT__
and the power of our militari is a testament to the strength of our militari famili __PUNCT__
when our troop come home wound __PUNCT__ thei cannot heal alon __PUNCT__
we must support the famili that care for our veteran __PUNCT__
our resolv to support these famili bear wit to the charact of our nation __PUNCT__
often __PUNCT__ spous and parent ar forc to leav their job in order to care for a wound troop __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will offer a comprehens disabl insur polici that will averag forti thousand dollar __PUNCT__
it will cover the necessari expens for the next of kin when a spous __PUNCT__ parent __PUNCT__ or other famili member stai by the side of a wound veteran dure the recoveri process __PUNCT__
i will offer up to a year of paid leav __PUNCT__ to ensur the financi stabil of the famili of recov veteran __PUNCT__
and we must recogn that not all injuri can be treat with bandag and stent __PUNCT__
mental trauma __PUNCT__ post __PUNCT__ traumat stress disord __PUNCT__ traumat brain injuri __PUNCT__
these ar battlefield injuri __PUNCT__
we cannot ignor them just becaus we can't see them on a soldier or marin bodi __PUNCT__
there should be an automat presumpt that mental ill ar servic relat __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ we need to revamp our entir veteran __PUNCT__ disabl system __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we have a system that ha been design to protect the financi interest of the govern rather than address the medic condit of our veteran __PUNCT__
that is wrong __PUNCT__
a veteran who ha serv honor should not have to prove he or she is entitl to care __PUNCT__
rather __PUNCT__ the burden of proof should be on the govern to meet it oblig __PUNCT__ and to meet them as fulli and honor as our veteran have met their __PUNCT__
all of them __PUNCT__ all who have serv have commit themselv to the protect of our nation __PUNCT__
mani have risk their live over and over again __PUNCT__
and i believ that we __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__ have a lifelong duti to our veteran __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will reduc feder incom tax by five percent for all veteran for the rest of their live __PUNCT__
senat jim webb __PUNCT__ on of our nation greatest veteran __PUNCT__ is exactli right on thi issu __PUNCT__ and i will fight for hi propos __PUNCT__
i will also elimin feder incom tax for all troop in their first year out of the militari __PUNCT__
it is our respons to eas the frequent __PUNCT__ difficult transit from militari to civilian life __PUNCT__
presid bush cut tax for our nation wealthiest citizen __PUNCT__
i will cut tax for our nation bravest citizen __PUNCT__
i alreadi done it in new mexico __PUNCT__
we elimin the state incom tax for all activ __PUNCT__ duti militari pai __PUNCT__
i led the nation by purchas a __NUM__ dollar life insur premium for each and everi member of the new mexico nation guard __PUNCT__
__NUM__ other state have follow our lead __PUNCT__
guard personnel and their famili around the countri ar now much better protect against the worst __PUNCT__
i grant free tuition to ani new mexico public univers for ani child of a new mexican guardsman kill in action __PUNCT__
educ is the spark that light mind __PUNCT__
and the gi bill wa the fuse to the econom explos that power our nation through the last centuri __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will fight for a new gi bill for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
my nation servic plan will augment the gi bill and the servic __PUNCT__ colleg fund with addit fund for colleg and career educ __PUNCT__ up to __NUM__ dollar in loan forgiv __PUNCT__
furthermor __PUNCT__ my plan will allow a spous or child to us these benefit __PUNCT__ if the servic member doesn't __PUNCT__
and i will make sure that all servic member get the benefit that thei earn __PUNCT__
what happen to the iowa nation guard is outrag __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ it is a perfect exampl of how thi administr talk about support the troop __PUNCT__ and then deni them the benefit thei deserv __PUNCT__
the men and women of the iowa guard serv the longest tour of ani combat unit in iraq __PUNCT__
their deploy wa extend not onc __PUNCT__ but twice __PUNCT__
some were on activ duti for __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ when thei return home the administr told them __PUNCT__ sorri __PUNCT__
you on dai short of get your full benefit __PUNCT__
on dai short __PUNCT__
thi is unconscion __PUNCT__
it is disgrac __PUNCT__
it is just plain wrong __PUNCT__
while i am glad congressman bralei and other ar work hard to fix thi problem for these veteran __PUNCT__ when i am presid i will make sure that thi never happen again for ani veteran __PUNCT__
i will count all dai __PUNCT__ both at home and abroad __PUNCT__ that guard and reserv personnel serv on activ duti dure wartim toward their cumul total of dai serv __PUNCT__
it is enough that thei have serv these dai __PUNCT__ thei should not have to serv them consecut __PUNCT__
i will also guarante __PUNCT__ that employ give mobil member of the guard and reserv their old job back __PUNCT__
no question ask __PUNCT__
and we got to help small busi do their part __PUNCT__
i will offer a tax credit for small busi who go the extra mile and help make up the differ in pai for guard and reserv personnel call to activ __PUNCT__ duti __PUNCT__

i ow my success in bring peopl togeth and solv problem to take risk __PUNCT__
sometim you have to lai thing on the line to get result __PUNCT__
i have negoti with some of the toughest dictat in the world and come home success __PUNCT__
i went to north korea earlier thi year on a bipartisan mission __PUNCT__
i came home with the remain of six soldier miss in action sinc the korean war __PUNCT__
i negoti the releas of american servicemen and civilian from iraq __PUNCT__ north korea __PUNCT__ and cuba __PUNCT__
i recal when on of my constitu wa taken hostag in sudan __PUNCT__
he wa an american journalist from my own state and he wa captur with two aid from the african nation of chad __PUNCT__
thei were imprison on phoni charg of espionag __PUNCT__ i had no reason to be optimist about their releas __PUNCT__
but the journalist wife ask me to go and try to get him out __PUNCT__
so i went __PUNCT__
the dictat of that countri __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ bashir __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ you can have the american __PUNCT__ but the other two from chad __PUNCT__ thei stai __PUNCT__
at thi point i could have left with the american __PUNCT__ but i said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i am bring them all out __PUNCT__
it wa not the easi choic but it wa the right choic __PUNCT__
we went back into the negoti and i left with all three men __PUNCT__

and it sacrific the safeti of our troop __PUNCT__
