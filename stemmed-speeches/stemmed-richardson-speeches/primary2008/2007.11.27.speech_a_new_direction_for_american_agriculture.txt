i know that we can do all of these thing becaus as i travel the countri it ha becom clear to me that american ar readi to act __PUNCT__
what our countri need now is real leadership __PUNCT__
i spent my entir life bring peopl togeth to get thing done __PUNCT__
i ow my success in solv problem to take risk __PUNCT__
earlier in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i took some heat from the smarti __PUNCT__ pant set in washington for sai that iowa should receiv it fair share of anti __PUNCT__ terror fund __PUNCT__
i knew it wouldn't be an easi posit to take __PUNCT__ but i thought it wa clear that we need to protect our nation food suppli from terrorist __PUNCT__
i still feel that wai __PUNCT__
when i presid __PUNCT__ we go to beef up usda inspect of our domest foodstuff __PUNCT__ and we go to get tough on food import from foreign countri __PUNCT__
i go to work to diversifi our stock of food speci __PUNCT__
and i go to make sure that we implement countri of origin label law immedi __PUNCT__
i pledg to the american peopl that i will do whatev it take to keep our food suppli safe __PUNCT__
so even though i took some heat __PUNCT__
i know it wa the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and sometim you have to lai thing on the line to get result __PUNCT__
i rememb when on of my constitu wa taken hostag in sudan __PUNCT__
he wa an american journalist from my own state and he wa captur with two aid from the african nation of chad __PUNCT__
thei were imprison on phoni charg of espionag __PUNCT__
i had no reason to be optimist about their releas __PUNCT__
but the journalist wife ask me to go and try to get him out __PUNCT__
so i went __PUNCT__
the dictat of that countri __PUNCT__ al __PUNCT__ bashir __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ you can have the american __PUNCT__ but the other two from chad __PUNCT__ thei stai __PUNCT__
at thi point i could have left with the american __PUNCT__ but i said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__
i am bring them all out __PUNCT__
it wa not the easi choic but it wa the right choic __PUNCT__
we went back into the negoti and i left with all three men __PUNCT__
there wa no time then for poll or consult __PUNCT__
and now is not the time for polit calcul __PUNCT__
nor is thi a time for the polit of neg __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i haven't read all the other candid __PUNCT__ farm plan __PUNCT__
but from what i can tell __PUNCT__ thei must think you gui have too much dirt out here __PUNCT__ becaus thei bring a lot of it to back to the campaign trail and sling it around at each other __PUNCT__
i sai __PUNCT__ let keep the mud where it belong __PUNCT__
we cannot build america up by tear each other down __PUNCT__
think of our troop in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
thei don't serv as democrat or as republican __PUNCT__ thei serv as american __PUNCT__
we have to do the same here at home __PUNCT__ to build a great american futur __PUNCT__
at the begin of thi race __PUNCT__ i offer a pledg to campaign posit __PUNCT__
i stand by that pledg __PUNCT__
i refus to attack anyon charact __PUNCT__
that is not we need and i call on my colleagu to stop it __PUNCT__
win an elect is not worth sacrif our principl __PUNCT__
that doe not mean we don't have polici differ __PUNCT__ and that what we should be talk about __PUNCT__
our differ vision for bring peac to iraq __PUNCT__
on educ __PUNCT__
on energi __PUNCT__
on stop a war with iran __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ in washington todai there too much neg __PUNCT__
neg over health care __PUNCT__
neg over immigr __PUNCT__
but when i travel around iowa __PUNCT__ i see someth differ __PUNCT__
i am remind again that we ar a posit nation __PUNCT__ found on inspir principl __PUNCT__
i see a place where charact is more than the content of your bank account __PUNCT__
where leadership mean more than a list of thing you plan to do __PUNCT__
where your neighbor word is more import than all the smooth talk in the world __PUNCT__
i see a peopl who reward those who work hard __PUNCT__ but also recogn that even the hardest worker cannot do it alon __PUNCT__
i see a nation attach to our land __PUNCT__ but root in our valu __PUNCT__
i have a vision of america in ascend __PUNCT__
it a vision that all our peopl __PUNCT__ whether thei ar in blue __PUNCT__ red our purpl state can share __PUNCT__
thi is america __PUNCT__
we land a man on the moon __PUNCT__
we built the internet __PUNCT__
we beat the great depress __PUNCT__
we defeat the nazi __PUNCT__
we rout the soviet union in a global battl over the futur of the planet __PUNCT__
so my messag for all those who ar pessimist __PUNCT__ those who ar neg __PUNCT__ those who ar angri is thi __PUNCT__ we can do it __PUNCT__
to those who said i couldn't get those hostag out of sudan __PUNCT__ i said i can __PUNCT__
and i did it __PUNCT__
to those who sai we can't get a fair deal for our famili farmer __PUNCT__ i sai we can __PUNCT__
to those who sai we can't we can't revit our rural economi __PUNCT__ i sai we can __PUNCT__
to those who sai we can't conserv our land and water __PUNCT__ i sai we can __PUNCT__
to those who sai we can't spark a new energi revolut __PUNCT__ i sai we can __PUNCT__
to those who engag in the polit of person attack __PUNCT__ i sai we can do better __PUNCT__
if we work togeth __PUNCT__ we can solv our problem __PUNCT__
we can __PUNCT__
and we will __PUNCT__
