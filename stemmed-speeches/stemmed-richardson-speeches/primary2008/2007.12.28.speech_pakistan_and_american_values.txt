benazir bhutto devot her life to bring democraci to the peopl of pakistan __PUNCT__
peopl who have known far too much of tyranni and violenc and far too littl of liberti __PUNCT__
she could have chosen to live a life of comfort in exil __PUNCT__
but instead __PUNCT__ she risk her life for the thing that she believ in __PUNCT__
the principl of democraci __PUNCT__
the digniti of human be __PUNCT__
these were her ideal __PUNCT__
these ar our ideal __PUNCT__
i repres america around the world __PUNCT__

in the midst of civil war __PUNCT__
and i have learn that peopl ar often sustain and move by littl more than an unshak belief in these ideal __PUNCT__
benazir bhutto assassin were take aim at democraci __PUNCT__
thei have taken side against the global struggl for human right __PUNCT__
america itself is challeng by thi horribl tragedi __PUNCT__
a question is put befor us __PUNCT__
it is a question that is ask us everi dai __PUNCT__ with greater and greater urgenc __PUNCT__
that question is __PUNCT__ what will our nation stand for __PUNCT__ even as we mourn the death of on voic for freedom __PUNCT__
we must answer clearli and forcefulli the question of america role in a danger world __PUNCT__
we must answer __PUNCT__
for though america under bush ha lost it wai as the leader of the world __PUNCT__ billion of peopl still yearn for our basic principl __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__
equal __PUNCT__
human digniti __PUNCT__
these ar the valu that america must stand for __PUNCT__
these ar the valu that i will fight for as presid __PUNCT__
some sai stand for such principl __PUNCT__
weaken us __PUNCT__
thei sai that we cannot fight evil without sacrif our core belief __PUNCT__
thei ar wrong __PUNCT__
if we have learn anyth over the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ it is that when america fail to live up to it own ideal __PUNCT__ we ar weaker __PUNCT__ not stronger __PUNCT__ as a result __PUNCT__
when we live our democrat principl __PUNCT__ as we have in the past __PUNCT__ we ar stronger __PUNCT__
we ar stronger at home __PUNCT__
we ar stronger abroad __PUNCT__
and our strength make us safer __PUNCT__
but histori ha taught us that we ar onli as strong as our leader ar will to be when face with the polit of expedi __PUNCT__ when thei choos power over principl __PUNCT__ tyranni over freedom __PUNCT__
i pledg to you todai __PUNCT__ with all my be and with all my resolv i will never compromis our nation or show weak in the face of tyranni __PUNCT__
america must alwai lead in the name of freedom and we should never allow our nation to perpetu dictatorship or provid support to tyrant to oppress their peopl __PUNCT__
these polici not onli betrai our valu __PUNCT__ thei make us weaker and less safe __PUNCT__ turn whole popul against us __PUNCT__
we ar at our strongest when we stand for principl over power __PUNCT__
yesterdai __PUNCT__ i call for presid musharraf to step down __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ as a nation i am call on the administr to stand firm for our ideal in the face of terror and in respect for the ideal bhutto stood for __PUNCT__
anyth less would send a danger signal to the world that terror alter our resolv __PUNCT__
we must learn that when our polici and our action conflict with the democrat goal of a nation __PUNCT__ of their own peopl __PUNCT__ we fail __PUNCT__
the world look to america for leadership __PUNCT__
but the bush administr ha fail to build a foreign polici worthi of our ideal __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ bush ha given us guantanamo __PUNCT__ abu ghraib __PUNCT__ secret prison __PUNCT__ wiretap __PUNCT__ and tortur __PUNCT__
our moral leadership around the world ha been tarnish __PUNCT__
and make no mistak __PUNCT__ thi administr is lose the war on terror __PUNCT__
yesterdai assassin tell us thi __PUNCT__
the resurg of al qaeda and the taliban __PUNCT__ especi along the pakistan __PUNCT__ afghanistan border __PUNCT__ tell us thi __PUNCT__
our continu presenc in iraq tell us thi __PUNCT__
bush foreign polici ha fail __PUNCT__
but not for lack of opportun to make it better __PUNCT__
when musharraf declar martial law __PUNCT__ we could have stood up __PUNCT__
but we did not __PUNCT__
when he suspend the constitut __PUNCT__ we could have stood up __PUNCT__
but we did not __PUNCT__
now after yesterdai terribl murder __PUNCT__
the unit state must stand up __PUNCT__
presid bush should immedi suspend non __PUNCT__ terror relat militari aid to pakistan until presid musharraf resign __PUNCT__
not on penni more __PUNCT__ until musharraf is gone and the rule of law is restor __PUNCT__
month ago __PUNCT__ when the constitut crisi erupt __PUNCT__
i said that we must stand with the pakistani peopl __PUNCT__
that we must us our militari aid as leverag to forc elect __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ bush chose to continu to support the dictat __PUNCT__ and the terror went on unab __PUNCT__
pakistan is a state with nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and our current polici ar push it in the wrong direct __PUNCT__
we have subsid oppress for too long __PUNCT__ and the cost have not onli been paid in dollar __PUNCT__
we have paid with our secur __PUNCT__
we have paid with the safeti of american live __PUNCT__
some of my democrat oppon have misplac faith in musharraf __PUNCT__
like the bush administr __PUNCT__ thei cling to a misguid notion that musharraf can be trust as an alli to fight terror or to chang hi despot wai __PUNCT__
despit their faith __PUNCT__ musharraf ha thumb hi nose at america again and again __PUNCT__
how mani time doe the washington convent wisdom need to be proven tragic wrong __PUNCT__ befor washington insid give up on it __PUNCT__ musharraf must step asid now __PUNCT__ and allow a technocrat caretak govern to lead the countri until free and fair elect ar held __PUNCT__
and those elect should be held veri soon __PUNCT__
some sai there ar risk to musharraf step down __PUNCT__
but the risk ar greater if he doe not __PUNCT__
hi inadequ attempt to disrupt terrorist activ on pakistan border with afghanistan __PUNCT__
have onli encourag tribal leader to cooper with the taliban __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ the border area ha been turn into a safe haven for terrorist __PUNCT__
and though some stoke the fear of an islamist takeov of pakistan __PUNCT__
the realiti is that the vast major of pakistani will vote for the mainstream democrat parti __PUNCT__ as thei alwai have in the past __PUNCT__
current __PUNCT__ poll show that onli fifteen percent of pakistani would vote for the islamist parti __PUNCT__
but if we continu to support tyranni in pakistan __PUNCT__ that number will onli grow __PUNCT__ a lesson brought home to us all too painfulli by yesterdai violenc __PUNCT__
musharraf narrow polit base plai into the hand of the taliban and al qaeda __PUNCT__
onli a broadli __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ democrat __PUNCT__ elect govern will be abl to wage what musharraf promis __PUNCT__ but did not deliv __PUNCT__ an effect war against al qaeda and the taliban __PUNCT__
presid bush face a choic with pakistan __PUNCT__ he need to choos whether to support the dictat or the pakistani peopl __PUNCT__
he chose the dictat __PUNCT__
repeatedli __PUNCT__
and by do so __PUNCT__ he ha let down both the american and the pakistani peopl __PUNCT__
we cannot afford anoth presid who is a foreign polici novic __PUNCT__
we cannot afford anoth presid who take the easiest path __PUNCT__ rather than the right path __PUNCT__
a presid who make wrong choic __PUNCT__ becaus he doesn't know how to make the hard but right choic __PUNCT__
the next presid must be a leader who ha been test __PUNCT__
in the cours of thi campaign __PUNCT__ all the candid were ask whether there were time when we should put human right befor our secur __PUNCT__
that question is a symptom of the think that is lead us astrai __PUNCT__
it is a fals choic __PUNCT__
our principl ar the backbon of our secur __PUNCT__
thei give us direct __PUNCT__
thei bring us alli __PUNCT__
thei make us strong __PUNCT__
some of us have alwai known that __PUNCT__
nearli ten year ago __PUNCT__ al qaeda first attack america in east africa __PUNCT__
month befor that attack __PUNCT__ i went to afghanistan to press the taliban to hand over osama bin laden __PUNCT__
thei refus __PUNCT__
so we impos tough un sanction on them __PUNCT__ and began build a coalit to keep america safe __PUNCT__
after my trip to afghanistan __PUNCT__ bin laden put out a threat on my life __PUNCT__ but i knew that we were do the right thing __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ presid bush revers cours __PUNCT__
until __NUM__ __PUNCT__ he ignor the mani expert who warn him that al qaeda wa plan to attack us at home __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ after the afghanistan campaign __PUNCT__ he took hi ey off the ball again __PUNCT__
he squander our resourc and intern support by conduct a disastr war of choic in iraq __PUNCT__
becaus of hi inexperi __PUNCT__ he listen to the ideologu __PUNCT__
that war ha divert critic intellig and militari resourc from the fight against al qaeda and terror __PUNCT__
we let up the pressur and al qaeda recov __PUNCT__
so the result todai is an al qaeda which is more diffus and more deadli than ever __PUNCT__
our intellig servic sai it is headquart in pakistan __PUNCT__ along the afghanistan border __PUNCT__ and that it is plan and train to attack america at home again __PUNCT__
we need to address the threat of intern terror with the focu it deserv __PUNCT__
the war against al qaeda is a tough militari fight __PUNCT__ but that it is more than just a militari fight __PUNCT__
it is also a fight for the heart and mind of the world muslim __PUNCT__
and bush botch occup of iraq ha plai right into the hand of the jihadist __PUNCT__ bolster their propaganda that the us want to kill muslim __PUNCT__ and that we invad iraq so that we could control the muslim world oil __PUNCT__
never ha america been as unpopular as it is todai __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ and in mani other muslim countri __PUNCT__ poll show that our credibl ha plummet __PUNCT__
as a direct result of the presid poor choic __PUNCT__ larg major of muslim now sai thei distrust america __PUNCT__
such sentiment facilit jihadist recruit and boost their popular support __PUNCT__
and to hear the republican candid for presid __PUNCT__
thei would continu thi nation on a truli danger path __PUNCT__
thei fail to recogn that the endur power rest not just in our militari strength __PUNCT__ but in our ideal __PUNCT__
we must win the war of idea with al qaeda __PUNCT__
the peopl of the world will embrac us if we return to an american foreign polici base not onli upon our power __PUNCT__ but also upon our valu __PUNCT__
i will close guantanamo and all secret prison __PUNCT__
we will again honor the geneva convent and we will requir other nation to honor the treati in protect our soldier __PUNCT__
when i am presid __PUNCT__ i will put an end to tortur __PUNCT__
and there will be investig __PUNCT__
we will find out who wa respons for the tortur that america ha engag in __PUNCT__ and thei will be prosecut __PUNCT__
no on will be abov the law __PUNCT__
no on __PUNCT__
we will lead the world onc again as a champion of democraci and human right __PUNCT__
we will care about place like darfur __PUNCT__
we will lead the peopl of the world to stop the genocid there __PUNCT__
we will not turn a blind ey to human suffer __PUNCT__
we will again lead the fight against diseas and poverti across the planet __PUNCT__
america is better than the bush __PUNCT__ chenei administr __PUNCT__
to win the war against al qaeda __PUNCT__
we must return to our proud tradit __PUNCT__
to defeat al qaeda __PUNCT__ we must get our troop out of iraq and reinforc our presenc along the afghanistan __PUNCT__ pakistan border __PUNCT__
we must enhanc our commit __PUNCT__ militari __PUNCT__ polit and econom __PUNCT__ to afghanistan __PUNCT__
to final defeat the murder who attack thi countri on __NUM__ __PUNCT__
defeat the resurg taliban will requir a signific increas in nato forc along the afghanistan __PUNCT__ pakistan border __PUNCT__
and that will requir restor american credibl and skill american leadership __PUNCT__
american deserv to know todai __PUNCT__
what the candid __PUNCT__ plan ar __PUNCT__ not the dai on of us is inaugur __PUNCT__
i have been clear __PUNCT__
i believ our obsess with iraq undermin our abil to fight the real terrorist __PUNCT__
we must get all our troop out of iraq and as quickli and respons as possibl __PUNCT__
onli then __PUNCT__ will we have the resourc and credibl to destroi the organ that attack us on 9/11 __PUNCT__
i have also been more specif than my colleagu about afghanistan __PUNCT__
i am call for five addit brigad to be deploi to afghanistan __PUNCT__
that __NUM__ troop __PUNCT__
two brigad should be sent to the border to stop terrorist from infiltr afghanistan through the pakistani border __PUNCT__
i would send two brigad to the south to fight a resurg taliban there __PUNCT__
and on brigad should redeploi to the west to deter iran from ani thought of expansion __PUNCT__
we also need a civilian surg in war against terror __PUNCT__
the militari cannot and should not shoulder the entir burden of our foreign polici __PUNCT__ the whole govern must pitch in __PUNCT__
that mean activ engin __PUNCT__ diplomat __PUNCT__ and other essenti profession to contribut to the broader effort __PUNCT__
we cannot win the war against al qaeda alon __PUNCT__
it is urgent that we rebuild our allianc __PUNCT__ so that we can onc again lead other nation __PUNCT__
trust is critic to get alli to work with us in the secret world of counter terror and in the open world of public diplomaci __PUNCT__
thi administr ha driven awai our alli with swagger and saber rattl __PUNCT__
i will rebuild our allianc by make common caus with partner who share our valu and interest __PUNCT__
the peopl of the world ar thirsti for america to onc again stand for the great ideal of human histori __PUNCT__
american want our global leadership to be worthi of the principl __PUNCT__ valu __PUNCT__ and tradit we have inherit __PUNCT__
our peopl do not lack the courag to stand for a foreign polici that is both strong and decent __PUNCT__
what the american peopl ar miss __PUNCT__
what our countri doe desper need __PUNCT__ is a leader who ha been test __PUNCT__
a presid who ha been there __PUNCT__ and who know what the real choic ar and how to make them __PUNCT__
a presid who ha the experi to lead in danger time __PUNCT__
we need a presid who recogn that thi is not the time for consult and polit calcul __PUNCT__
a presid cannot decid what is right by take a poll __PUNCT__
we need someon who is true to america optimist spirit __PUNCT__
anger __PUNCT__ bicker __PUNCT__ mistrust __PUNCT__
should not defin our nation __PUNCT__
we need to stand unit onc again __PUNCT__ clear about who we ar and what we need to do to meet the seriou challeng we face __PUNCT__
and so todai __PUNCT__ in the wake of tragedi __PUNCT__ i see hope __PUNCT__
i see a new wai forward for american leadership in the world __PUNCT__
