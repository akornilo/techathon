i wa born in the middl of the centuri in the middl of the countri __PUNCT__ a classic babi boomer __PUNCT__
it wa a time when american were return from war and eager to work __PUNCT__
to be an american wa to assum that all thing were possibl __PUNCT__
when presid kennedi challeng american to go to the moon __PUNCT__ the question wasn't whether we get there __PUNCT__ it wa onli when we get there __PUNCT__
the sole of neil armstrong boot on the moon made perman impress on our soul and in our nation psych __PUNCT__

that how i wa brought up __PUNCT__
my dad had been born in mexico and hi famili had to leav dure the mexican revolut __PUNCT__
i grew up with stori of hi famili be fed by the us govern as war refuge __PUNCT__
my dad never made it through colleg and apprent as a lath and plaster carpent __PUNCT__
and he had big dream __PUNCT__
he convinc my mom __PUNCT__ a beauti young actress __PUNCT__ to give up hollywood to marri him __PUNCT__
he move to detroit __PUNCT__ led a great automobil compani and becam governor of the great state of michigan __PUNCT__
we were mormon and grow up in michigan __PUNCT__ that might have seem unusu or out of place but i realli don't rememb it that wai __PUNCT__
my friend care more about what sport team we follow than what church we went to __PUNCT__
my mom and dad gave their kid the greatest gift of all __PUNCT__ the gift of uncondit love __PUNCT__
thei care deepli about who we would be __PUNCT__ and much less about what we would do __PUNCT__
uncondit love is a gift that ann and i have tri to pass on to our son and now to our grandchildren __PUNCT__
all the law and legisl in the world will never heal thi world like the love heart and arm of mother and father __PUNCT__
if everi child could drift to sleep feel wrap in the love of their famili __PUNCT__ and god love __PUNCT__ thi world would be a far more gentl and better place __PUNCT__
mom and dad were marri __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and if you wonder what their secret wa __PUNCT__ you could have ask the local florist __PUNCT__ becaus everi dai dad gave mom a rose __PUNCT__ which he put on her bedsid tabl __PUNCT__
that how she found out what happen on the dai my father di __PUNCT__ she went look for him becaus that morn __PUNCT__ there wa no rose __PUNCT__
my mom and dad were true partner __PUNCT__ a life lesson that shape me by everydai exampl __PUNCT__
when my mom ran for the senat __PUNCT__ my dad wa there for her everi step of the wai __PUNCT__
i can still hear her sai in her beauti voic __PUNCT__ why should women have ani less sai than men __PUNCT__ about the great decis face our nation __PUNCT__
i wish she could have been here at the convent and heard leader like governor mari fallin __PUNCT__ governor nikki halei __PUNCT__ governor susana martinez __PUNCT__ senat kelli ayott and secretari of state condoleezza rice __PUNCT__
as governor of massachusett __PUNCT__ i chose a woman lt __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ a woman chief of staff __PUNCT__ half of my cabinet and senior offici were women __PUNCT__ and in busi __PUNCT__ i mentor and support great women leader who went on to run great compani __PUNCT__
i grew up in detroit in love with car and want to be a car gui __PUNCT__ like my dad __PUNCT__
but by the time i wa out of school __PUNCT__ i realiz that i had to go out on my own __PUNCT__ that if i stai around michigan in the same busi __PUNCT__ i never realli know if i wa get a break becaus of my dad __PUNCT__
i want to go someplac new and prove myself __PUNCT__
those weren't the easiest of dai __PUNCT__ too mani long hour and weekend work __PUNCT__ five young son who seem to have thi need to re __PUNCT__ enact a differ world war everi night __PUNCT__
but if you ask ann and i what we give __PUNCT__ to break up just on more fight between the boi __PUNCT__ or wake up in the morn and discov a pile of kid asleep in our room __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ everi mom and dad know the answer to that __PUNCT__
those dai were toughest on ann __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
she wa heroic __PUNCT__
five boi __PUNCT__ with our famili a long wai awai __PUNCT__
i had to travel a lot for my job then and i call and try to offer support __PUNCT__
but everi mom know that doesn't help get the homework done or the kid out the door to school __PUNCT__
i knew that her job as a mom wa harder than mine __PUNCT__
and i knew without question __PUNCT__ that her job as a mom wa a lot more import than mine __PUNCT__
and as america saw tuesdai night __PUNCT__ ann would have succeed at anyth she want to __PUNCT__
like a lot of famili in a new place with no famili __PUNCT__ we found kinship with a wide circl of friend through our church __PUNCT__
when we were new to the commun it wa welcom and as the year went by __PUNCT__ it wa a joi to help other who had just move to town or just join our church __PUNCT__
we had remark vibrant and divers congreg from all walk of life and mani who were new to america __PUNCT__
we prai togeth __PUNCT__ our kid plai togeth and we alwai stood readi to help each other out in differ wai __PUNCT__
and that how it is in america __PUNCT__
we look to our commun __PUNCT__ our faith __PUNCT__ our famili for our joi __PUNCT__ our support __PUNCT__ in good time and bad __PUNCT__
it is both how we live our live and why we live our live __PUNCT__
the strength and power and good of america ha alwai been base on the strength and power and good of our commun __PUNCT__ our famili __PUNCT__ our faith __PUNCT__
that is the bedrock of what make america __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__
in our best dai __PUNCT__ we can feel the vibranc of america commun __PUNCT__ larg and small __PUNCT__
it when we see that new busi open up downtown __PUNCT__
it when we go to work in the morn and see everybodi els on our block do the same __PUNCT__
it when our son or daughter call from colleg to talk about which job offer thei should take __PUNCT__ and you try not to choke up when you hear that the on thei like is not far from home __PUNCT__
it that good feel when you have more time to volunt to coach your kid soccer team __PUNCT__ or help out on school trip __PUNCT__
but for too mani american __PUNCT__ these good dai ar harder to come by __PUNCT__
how mani dai have you woken up feel that someth realli special wa happen in america __PUNCT__
mani of you felt that wai on elect dai four year ago __PUNCT__
hope and chang had a power appeal __PUNCT__
but tonight i ask a simpl question __PUNCT__ if you felt that excit when you vote for barack obama __PUNCT__ shouldn't you feel that wai now that he presid obama __PUNCT__ you know there someth wrong with the kind of job he done as presid when the best feel you had wa the dai you vote for him __PUNCT__
the presid hasn't disappoint you becaus he want to __PUNCT__
the presid ha disappoint america becaus he hasn't led america in the right direct __PUNCT__
he took offic without the basic qualif that most american have and on that wa essenti to hi task __PUNCT__
he had almost no experi work in a busi __PUNCT__
job to him ar about govern __PUNCT__
i learn the real lesson about how america work from experi __PUNCT__
when i wa __NUM__ i help start a small compani __PUNCT__
my partner and i had been work for a compani that wa in the busi of help other busi __PUNCT__
so some of us had thi idea that if we realli believ our advic wa help compani __PUNCT__ we should invest in compani __PUNCT__
we should bet on ourselv and on our advic __PUNCT__
so we start a new busi call bain capit __PUNCT__
the onli problem wa __PUNCT__ while we believ in ourselv __PUNCT__ nobodi els did __PUNCT__
we were young and had never done thi befor and we almost didn't get off the ground __PUNCT__
in those dai __PUNCT__ sometim i wonder if i had made a realli big mistak __PUNCT__
i had thought about ask my church pension fund to invest __PUNCT__ but i didn't __PUNCT__
i figur it wa bad enough that i might lose my investor __PUNCT__ monei __PUNCT__ but i didn't want to go to hell too __PUNCT__
show what i know __PUNCT__
anoth of my partner got the episcop church pension fund to invest __PUNCT__
todai there ar a lot of happi retir priest who should thank him __PUNCT__
that busi we start with __NUM__ peopl ha now grown into a great american success stori __PUNCT__
some of the compani we help start ar name you know __PUNCT__
an offic suppli compani call stapl __PUNCT__ where i pleas to see the obama campaign ha been shop __PUNCT__ the sport author __PUNCT__ which becam a favorit of my son __PUNCT__
we start an earli childhood learn center call bright horizon that first ladi michel obama rightli prais __PUNCT__
at a time when nobodi thought we ever see a new steel mill built in america __PUNCT__ we took a chanc and built on in a corn field in indiana __PUNCT__
todai steel dynam is on of the largest steel produc in the unit state __PUNCT__
these ar american success stori __PUNCT__
and yet the centerpiec of the presid entir re __PUNCT__ elect campaign is attack success __PUNCT__
is it ani wonder that someon who attack success ha led the worst econom recoveri sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ in america __PUNCT__ we celebr success __PUNCT__ we don't apolog for it __PUNCT__
we weren't alwai success at bain __PUNCT__
but no on ever is in the real world of busi __PUNCT__
that what thi presid doesn't seem to understand __PUNCT__
busi and grow job is about take risk __PUNCT__ sometim fail __PUNCT__ sometim succeed __PUNCT__ but alwai strive __PUNCT__
it is about dream __PUNCT__
usual __PUNCT__ it doesn't work out exactli as you might have imagin __PUNCT__
steve job wa fire at appl __PUNCT__
he came back and chang the world __PUNCT__
it the geniu of the american free enterpris system __PUNCT__ to har the extraordinari creativ and talent and industri of the american peopl with a system that is dedic to creat tomorrow prosper rather than try to redistribut todai __PUNCT__
that is why everi presid sinc the great depress who came befor the american peopl ask for a second term could look back at the last four year and sai with satisfact __PUNCT__ you ar better off todai than you were four year ago __PUNCT__
except jimmi carter __PUNCT__
and except thi presid __PUNCT__
thi presid can ask us to be patient __PUNCT__
thi presid can tell us it wa someon els fault __PUNCT__
thi presid can tell us that the next four year he get it right __PUNCT__
but thi presid cannot tell us that you ar better off todai than when he took offic __PUNCT__
americaha been patient __PUNCT__
american have support thi presid in good faith __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ the time ha come to turn the page __PUNCT__
todai the time ha come for us to put the disappoint of the last four year behind us __PUNCT__
to put asid the divis and the recrimin __PUNCT__
to forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be __PUNCT__
now is the time to restor the promis of america __PUNCT__
mani american have given up on thi presid but thei haven't ever thought about give up __PUNCT__
not on themselv __PUNCT__
not on each other __PUNCT__
and not on america __PUNCT__
