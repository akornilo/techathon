iran ayatollah will not be permit to obtain nuclear weapon on my watch __PUNCT__
a nuclear __PUNCT__ arm iran is not onli a threat to israel __PUNCT__ it is a threat to the entir world __PUNCT__
our friend must never fear that we will not stand by them in an hour of need __PUNCT__
our enemi should never doubt our resolv __PUNCT__

we ar not distinguish from on anoth by our opposit to presid obama __PUNCT__ or even by our support for israel __PUNCT__
what distinguish us is our experi __PUNCT__ our perspect __PUNCT__ and our judgment __PUNCT__
i spent __NUM__ year in busi __PUNCT__

my famili __PUNCT__ my faith __PUNCT__ and our freedom __PUNCT__ these ar endur truth in my life __PUNCT__
my commit ar firm __PUNCT__ and thei do not falter __PUNCT__
when i wa young __PUNCT__ i had the opportun to live abroad __PUNCT__
i recogn that the greatest advantag my parent had given me wa be born in america __PUNCT__
i am passion about the principl that have made thi nation the land of opportun and a shine citi on a hill __PUNCT__
i believ in america __PUNCT__
i believ it is the greatest nation in the histori of the earth __PUNCT__
i believ that the next centuri must be an american centuri __PUNCT__
our highest prioriti must be to maintain a peopl __PUNCT__ an economi __PUNCT__ and a militari so strong that no nation would ever risk challeng it __PUNCT__
my faith in america stem both from my faith in the american peopl __PUNCT__ and from the principl that have made our peopl strong __PUNCT__
we ar a peopl from all part of the world and all walk of life __PUNCT__ but we ar strengthen by our nation uniqu found principl __PUNCT__
it is not accid or luck that made america the greatest nation in the world __PUNCT__ it is the power of our valu and belief __PUNCT__
we weather a great depress __PUNCT__
we emerg victori from two world war __PUNCT__
we face down an evil empir __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ as we face new challeng and threat __PUNCT__ i have everi convict that the american peopl __PUNCT__ edifi by american principl __PUNCT__ will rise to the occas again __PUNCT__ secur our safeti __PUNCT__ our prosper __PUNCT__ and our peac __PUNCT__
on of these principl is a merit __PUNCT__ base societi __PUNCT__
in a merit __PUNCT__ base societi __PUNCT__ peopl achiev success and reward through hard work __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ risk take __PUNCT__ and even a littl luck __PUNCT__
the founder consid thi principl to be on endow by our creator __PUNCT__ and call it the __PUNCT__ pursuit of happi __PUNCT__ we call it opportun __PUNCT__ or we call it the freedom to choos our cours in life __PUNCT__
a merit __PUNCT__ base __PUNCT__ opportun societi gather and creat a citizenri that pioneer __PUNCT__ that invent __PUNCT__ that build and creat __PUNCT__
and as these peopl exert the effort and take the risk inher in invent and creation __PUNCT__ thei emploi and lift the rest of us __PUNCT__ creat prosper for us all __PUNCT__
the reward thei earn do not make the rest of us poorer __PUNCT__ thei make us better off __PUNCT__
american prosper is fulli depend upon our opportun societi __PUNCT__
i don't think presid obama understand that __PUNCT__
i don't think he understand why our economi is the most success in the world __PUNCT__
i don't think he understand america __PUNCT__
he seek to replac our merit __PUNCT__ base societi with an entitl societi __PUNCT__
in an entitl societi __PUNCT__ everyon receiv the same or similar reward __PUNCT__ regardless of educ __PUNCT__ effort and willing to take risk __PUNCT__
that which is earn by some is redistribut to the other __PUNCT__
and the onli peopl to enjoi truli disproportion reward ar the peopl who do the redistribut __PUNCT__ the govern __PUNCT__
entitl societi ar prais in academ circl __PUNCT__ far remov from the realiti of a competit world __PUNCT__
opportun is replac by the certainti that everyon in an entitl societi will enjoi nearli the same reward __PUNCT__
but there is anoth certainti __PUNCT__ thei will be poor __PUNCT__
in an entitl societi __PUNCT__ the invigor pursuit of happi is replac by the deaden realiti that there is no prospect of a better tomorrow __PUNCT__
risk __PUNCT__ take disappear __PUNCT__ innov wither __PUNCT__ and small busi is replac by larg __PUNCT__ govern enterpris __PUNCT__
and the result is a nation that stagnat __PUNCT__ that declin __PUNCT__ that cannot defend itself __PUNCT__
i am convinc that thi is where presid obama __PUNCT__ fundament chang __PUNCT__ is lead america __PUNCT__
and it inform aspect of hi foreign polici __PUNCT__
internation __PUNCT__ presid obama ha adopt an appeas strategi __PUNCT__
appeas betrai a lack of faith in america __PUNCT__ in american strength __PUNCT__ and in america futur __PUNCT__
like other among the washington elit __PUNCT__ he believ that america role as the leader of the world is a thing of the past __PUNCT__ that thi will be a post __PUNCT__ american centuri __PUNCT__ perhap an asian centuri __PUNCT__
american strength __PUNCT__ he imagin __PUNCT__ will eventu or possibl be eclips __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ presid obama seek to appeas those he believ will balanc us or challeng our leadership __PUNCT__
thi appeas by thi administr ha taken mani form __PUNCT__
it includ offer to engag with the world most despic dictat __PUNCT__
it consist of concess to russia to remov our missil defens site from poland and to exclud tactic nuclear weapon from the new __PUNCT__ remark on __PUNCT__ side __PUNCT__ new start treati __PUNCT__
presid obama even look the other wai as china emploi unfair trade tactic that endang our economi and kill job __PUNCT__
thi presid appear more gener to our enemi than he is to our friend __PUNCT__
such is the natur tendenc of someon who is unsur of america strength __PUNCT__ or of america right place in the world __PUNCT__
the cours of appeas and accommod ha long been the path chosen by the weak and the timid __PUNCT__
and histori show it is a path that nation choos at their own peril __PUNCT__
the presid promis that he would fundament chang america __PUNCT__
he is do just that __PUNCT__
at home __PUNCT__ he is chang us from an opportun nation to an entitl nation __PUNCT__
he is build a govern so larg that feed it consum a greater and greater share of the peopl product __PUNCT__
and it is a govern so intrus that it can command free peopl and free enterpris accord to it bureaucrat will __PUNCT__
abroad __PUNCT__ he is weaken america __PUNCT__ shrink our militari __PUNCT__ shrink our commit to our friend __PUNCT__ accommod our foe __PUNCT__ and appeas the compet forc that ar vy for global leadership __PUNCT__
thi elect is not onli a referendum on presid obama failur on employ __PUNCT__ on incom growth __PUNCT__ on hous __PUNCT__ on recoveri __PUNCT__ or on a nuclear __PUNCT__ intent iran __PUNCT__ on an embolden china and on friend like israel be put at greater risk __PUNCT__
thi elect will decid what kind of america we will be __PUNCT__
it is defin __PUNCT__
will we remain an opportun nation or becom an entitl nation __PUNCT__ will we remain the leader of the free world __PUNCT__ or becom a follow in a more danger world __PUNCT__ will america be transform by barack obama __PUNCT__ or will america be restor with the found principl that have made thi the greatest nation histori ha ever known __PUNCT__
mani think that becaus of hi stagger failur __PUNCT__ presid obama will be easili defeat __PUNCT__
but an incumb is rare turn out of the white hous __PUNCT__ and hi resort to class warfar and demagogueri ar power polit weapon __PUNCT__
in less than a year __PUNCT__ american will be ask to make a choic about the kind of countri thei want to live in and the kind of futur thei will bequeath to their children __PUNCT__
it will be a choic between entitl and merit __PUNCT__ between appeas and resolv __PUNCT__
our parti must offer a candid who can make the case for freedom __PUNCT__ opportun and strength __PUNCT__
our nomine must offer american more than just a chanc to vote against presid obama __PUNCT__ our nomine must give american an opportun to vote for a differ path and a better futur __PUNCT__
a path dictat not by govern __PUNCT__ but determin by a free peopl __PUNCT__
a path mark by the virtu of merit __PUNCT__ not by the slow declin of entitl __PUNCT__
a path that achiev prosper through opportun __PUNCT__ and peac through strength __PUNCT__
thi is what american deserv __PUNCT__
thi is what the moment demand __PUNCT__
and thi is what i will deliv __PUNCT__ with your help __PUNCT__
join me __PUNCT__
