these clear measur ar the ultim test of american leadership __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ by these standard __PUNCT__ we haven't seen much in the presid first term that inspir confid in a second __PUNCT__
the presid polici have made it harder to recov from the deepest recess in seventi year __PUNCT__ expos the militari to cut that no on can justifi __PUNCT__ compromis our nation __PUNCT__ secur secret __PUNCT__ and in deal with other nation __PUNCT__ given trust where it is not earn __PUNCT__ insult where it is not deserv __PUNCT__ and apolog where it is not due __PUNCT__

i take pride that throughout histori our power ha brought justic where there wa tyranni __PUNCT__ peac where there wa conflict __PUNCT__ and hope where there wa afflict and despair __PUNCT__
i do not view america as just on more point on the strateg map __PUNCT__ on more power to be balanc __PUNCT__
i believ our countri is the greatest forc for good the world ha ever known __PUNCT__ and that our influenc is need as much now as ever __PUNCT__
and i am guid by on overwhelm convict and passion __PUNCT__ thi centuri must be an american centuri __PUNCT__

across the globe __PUNCT__ thei fought __PUNCT__ thei bled __PUNCT__ thei led __PUNCT__
thei show the world the extraordinari courag of the american heart and the generos of the american spirit __PUNCT__
that courag and generos remain unchang todai __PUNCT__
but sadli __PUNCT__ thi presid ha diminish american leadership __PUNCT__ and we ar reap the consequ __PUNCT__
the world is danger __PUNCT__ destruct __PUNCT__ chaotic __PUNCT__
and the two men run to be your command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief must offer their answer to the challeng we face __PUNCT__
like a watchman in the night __PUNCT__ we must remain at our post __PUNCT__ and keep guard of the freedom that defin and ennobl us __PUNCT__ and our friend __PUNCT__
in an american centuri __PUNCT__ we have the strongest economi and the strongest militari in the world __PUNCT__
in an american centuri __PUNCT__ we secur peac through our strength __PUNCT__
and if by absolut necess we must emploi it __PUNCT__ we must wield our strength with resolv __PUNCT__
in an american centuri __PUNCT__ we lead the free world and the free world lead the entir world __PUNCT__
if we do not have the strength or vision to lead __PUNCT__ then other power will take our place __PUNCT__ pull histori in a veri differ direct __PUNCT__
a just and peac world depend on a strong and confid america __PUNCT__
i pledg to you that if i becom command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ the unit state of america will fulfil it duti __PUNCT__ and it destini __PUNCT__
american leadership depend __PUNCT__ as it alwai ha __PUNCT__ on our econom strength __PUNCT__ on our militari strength __PUNCT__ and on our moral strength __PUNCT__
if ani of these falter __PUNCT__ no skill of diplomaci or presidenti oratori can compens __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the strength of our economi is in jeopardi __PUNCT__
a healthi american economi is what underwrit american power __PUNCT__
when growth is miss __PUNCT__ govern revenu fall __PUNCT__ social spend rise __PUNCT__ and mani in washington look to cut defens spend as an easi out __PUNCT__
that includ our current presid __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we ar just month awai from an arbitrari __PUNCT__ across __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ board budget reduct that would saddl the militari with a trillion dollar in cut __PUNCT__ sever shrink our forc structur __PUNCT__ and impair our abil to meet and deter threat __PUNCT__
don't bother try to find a seriou militari rational behind ani of thi __PUNCT__ unless that rational is wish think __PUNCT__
strategi is not drive presid obama massiv defens cut __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ hi own secretari of defens warn that these reduct would be __PUNCT__ devast __PUNCT__ and he is right __PUNCT__
that devast start at home __PUNCT__
these cut would onli weaken an alreadi stretch va system and impair our solemn commit that everi veteran receiv care second to none __PUNCT__
i will not allow that to happen __PUNCT__
thi is not the time for the presid radic cut in the militari __PUNCT__
look around the globe __PUNCT__
other major power ar rapidli ad to their militari capabl __PUNCT__ some with intent veri differ from our __PUNCT__
the regim in tehran is draw closer to develop a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
the threat of radic islam terror persist __PUNCT__
the threat of weapon of mass destruct prolifer is ever __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__
and we ar still at war and still have uniform men and women in conflict __PUNCT__
all thi and more is ongo in the world __PUNCT__
and yet the presid ha chosen thi moment for wholesal reduct in the nation militari capac __PUNCT__
when the biggest announc in hi last state of the union address on improv our militari wa that the pentagon will start us more clean energi __PUNCT__ then you know it time for a chang __PUNCT__
we not the first peopl to observ thi __PUNCT__
it is report that bob gate __PUNCT__ the presid first secretari of defens __PUNCT__ bluntli address anoth secur problem within thi administr __PUNCT__
after secret oper detail of the bin laden raid were given to report __PUNCT__ secretari gate walk into the west wing and told the obama team to __PUNCT__ shut up __PUNCT__ he ad a color word for emphasi __PUNCT__
live of american servicemen and women ar at stake __PUNCT__
but astonishingli __PUNCT__ the administr fail to chang it wai __PUNCT__
more top __PUNCT__ secret oper were leak __PUNCT__ even some involv covert action in iran __PUNCT__
thi isn't a partisan issu __PUNCT__ it a nation secur crisi __PUNCT__
and yesterdai __PUNCT__ democrat senat diann feinstein __PUNCT__ chairman of the senat intellig committe __PUNCT__ said __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ i think the white hous ha to understand that some of thi is come from their rank __PUNCT__
thi conduct is contempt __PUNCT__
it betrai our nation interest __PUNCT__
it compromis our men and women in the field __PUNCT__
and it demand a full and prompt investig by a special counsel __PUNCT__ with explan and consequ __PUNCT__
obama appointe __PUNCT__ who ar account to presid obama attornei gener __PUNCT__ should not be respons for investig the leak come from the obama white hous __PUNCT__
whoever provid classifi inform to the media __PUNCT__ seek polit advantag for the administr __PUNCT__ must be expos __PUNCT__ dismiss __PUNCT__ and punish __PUNCT__
the time for stonewal is over __PUNCT__
it is not enough to sai the matter is be look into __PUNCT__ and leav it at that __PUNCT__
when the issu is the polit us of highli sensit nation secur inform __PUNCT__ it is unaccept to sai __PUNCT__ we report our find after elect dai __PUNCT__
exactli who in the white hous betrai these secret __PUNCT__ did a superior author it __PUNCT__ these ar thing that american ar entitl to know __PUNCT__ and thei ar entitl to know right now __PUNCT__
if the presid believ __PUNCT__ as he said last week __PUNCT__ that the buck stop with him __PUNCT__ then he ow all american a full and prompt account of the fact __PUNCT__
and let me make thi veri clear __PUNCT__ these event make the decis we face in __DATE__ all the more import __PUNCT__
what kind of white hous would reveal classifi materi for polit gain __PUNCT__ i tell you right now __PUNCT__ mine won't __PUNCT__
the harm done when nation secur secret ar betrai extend __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ to the trust that alli place in the unit state __PUNCT__
the oper principl of american foreign polici ha been to work with our alli so that we can deter aggress befor it break out into open conflict __PUNCT__
that polici depend on nurtur our allianc and stand up for our common valu __PUNCT__
yet the presid ha move in the opposit direct __PUNCT__
it began with the sudden abandon of friend in poland and the czech republ __PUNCT__
thei had courag agre to provid site for our anti __PUNCT__ missil system __PUNCT__ onli to be told __PUNCT__ at the last hour __PUNCT__ that the agreement wa off __PUNCT__
as part of the so __PUNCT__ call reset in polici __PUNCT__ missil defens were sacrif as a unilater concess to the russian govern __PUNCT__
if that gestur wa design to inspir good will from russia __PUNCT__ it clearli miss the mark __PUNCT__
the russian govern defend the dictat in damascu __PUNCT__ arm him as he slaughter the syrian peopl __PUNCT__
we can onli guess what vladimir putin make of the obama administr __PUNCT__
he regain the russian presid in a corrupt elect __PUNCT__ and for that __PUNCT__ he got a congratulatori call from the oval offic __PUNCT__
and then there wa that exchang pick up by a microphon that presid obama didn't know wa on __PUNCT__
we heard him ask dmitri medvedev to tell mr __PUNCT__ putin to give him __PUNCT__ space __PUNCT__ thi is my last elect __PUNCT__ presid obama said __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ after my elect i have more flexibl __PUNCT__
why is flexibl with russian leader more import than transpar to the american peopl __PUNCT__
presid obama had a moment of candor __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ just the other dai __PUNCT__
he said that the action of the venezuelan dictat hugo chavez have not had a seriou nation secur impact on us __PUNCT__
in my view __PUNCT__ invit hezbollah into our hemispher is sever __PUNCT__ seriou __PUNCT__ and a threat __PUNCT__
but at least he wa consist __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ thi is the presid who falter when the iranian peopl were look for support in their struggl against the ayatollah __PUNCT__
that upris wa treat as an inconveni problem for the presid polici of engag __PUNCT__ instead of as a moral and strateg opportun __PUNCT__
that terribl misjudg should never be repeat __PUNCT__
when unarm women and men in tehran find the courag to confront their oppressor __PUNCT__ at risk of tortur and death __PUNCT__ thei should hear the unequivoc voic of an american presid affirm their right to be free __PUNCT__
i will leav reno thi even on a trip abroad that will take me to england __PUNCT__ poland __PUNCT__ and israel __PUNCT__
and sinc i wouldn't ventur into anoth countri to question american foreign polici __PUNCT__ i will tell you right here __PUNCT__ befor i leav __PUNCT__ what i think of thi administr shabbi treatment of on of our finest friend __PUNCT__
presid obama is fond of lectur israel leader __PUNCT__
he wa even caught by a microphon derid them __PUNCT__
he ha undermin their posit __PUNCT__ which wa tough enough as it wa __PUNCT__
and even at the unit nation __PUNCT__ to the enthusiast applaus of israel enemi __PUNCT__ he spoke as if our closest alli in the middl east wa the problem __PUNCT__
the peopl of israel deserv better than what thei have receiv from the leader of the free world __PUNCT__
and the choru of accus __PUNCT__ threat __PUNCT__ and insult at the unit nation should never again includ the voic of the presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
there ar valu __PUNCT__ caus __PUNCT__ and nation that depend on american strength __PUNCT__ on the clariti of our purpos __PUNCT__ and on the reliabl of our commit __PUNCT__
there is work in thi world that onli america and our alli can do __PUNCT__ hostil power that onli we can deter __PUNCT__ and challeng that onli we can overcom __PUNCT__
for the past decad __PUNCT__ among those challeng ha been the war in afghanistan __PUNCT__
as command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ i will have a solemn duti to our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
a presid ow our troop __PUNCT__ their famili __PUNCT__ and the american peopl a clear explan of our mission __PUNCT__ and a commit not to plai polit with the decis of war __PUNCT__
i have been critic of the presid decis to withdraw the surg troop dure the fight season __PUNCT__ against the advic of the command on the ground __PUNCT__
presid obama would have you believ that anyon who disagre with hi decis is argu for endless war __PUNCT__
but the rout to more war __PUNCT__ and to potenti attack here at home __PUNCT__ is a polit time retreat __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ my goal in afghanistan will be to complet a success transit to afghan secur forc by the end of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i will evalu condit on the ground and solicit the best advic of our militari command __PUNCT__
and i will affirm that my duti is not to my polit prospect __PUNCT__ but to the secur of the nation __PUNCT__
we face anoth continu challeng in a rise china __PUNCT__
china is attent to the interest of it govern __PUNCT__ but it too often disregard the right of it peopl __PUNCT__
it is select in the freedom it allow __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ as with it on __PUNCT__ child polici __PUNCT__ it can be ruthless in crush the freedom it deni __PUNCT__
in conduct trade with america __PUNCT__ it permit flagrant patent and copyright violat __PUNCT__ forestal american busi from compet in it market __PUNCT__ and manipul it currenc to obtain unfair advantag __PUNCT__
it is in our mutual interest for china to be a partner for a stabl and secur world __PUNCT__ and we welcom it particip in trade __PUNCT__
but the cheat must final be brought to a stop __PUNCT__
presid obama hasn't done it and won't do it __PUNCT__
i will __PUNCT__
we need that same clariti of purpos and resolv in the middl east __PUNCT__
america cannot be neutral in the outcom there __PUNCT__
we must clearli stand for the valu of repres govern __PUNCT__ econom opportun __PUNCT__ and human right __PUNCT__
and we must stand against the extens of iranian or jihadist influenc __PUNCT__
egypt is at the center of thi histor drama __PUNCT__
in mani wai __PUNCT__ it ha the power to tip the balanc in the arab world toward freedom and modern __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will not onli direct the billion in assist we give to egypt toward that goal __PUNCT__ but i will also work with partner nation to place condit on their assist as well __PUNCT__
unifi our collect influenc behind a common purpos will foster the develop of a govern that repres all egyptian __PUNCT__ maintain peac with israel __PUNCT__ and promot peac throughout the region __PUNCT__
the unit state is will to help egypt support peac and prosper __PUNCT__ but we will not be complicit in oppress and instabl __PUNCT__
there is no greater danger in the world todai than the prospect of the ayatollah in tehran possess nuclear weapon capabl __PUNCT__
yet for all the talk and confer __PUNCT__ all of the extens and assur __PUNCT__ can anyon sai we ar farther from thi danger now than four year ago __PUNCT__
the same ayatollah who each year mark a holidai by lead chant of __PUNCT__ death to america __PUNCT__ ar not go to be talk out of their pursuit of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
what need is all the firm __PUNCT__ clariti __PUNCT__ and moral courag that we and our alli can gather __PUNCT__
sanction must be enforc without except __PUNCT__ cut off the regim sourc of wealth __PUNCT__
negoti must secur full and unhind access for inspect __PUNCT__
as it is __PUNCT__ the iranian regim claim the right to enrich nuclear materi for supposedli peac purpos __PUNCT__
thi claim is discredit by year of decept __PUNCT__
a clear line must be drawn __PUNCT__ there must be a full suspens of ani enrich __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
and at everi turn __PUNCT__ iran must know that the unit state and our alli stand as on in these critic object __PUNCT__
onli in thi wai can we successfulli counter the catastroph threat that iran present __PUNCT__
i pledg to you and to all american that if i becom command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__ i will us everi mean necessari to protect ourselv and the region __PUNCT__ and to prevent the worst from happen while there is still time __PUNCT__
it is a mistak __PUNCT__ and sometim a tragic on __PUNCT__ to think that firm in american foreign polici can bring onli tension or conflict __PUNCT__
the surest path to danger is alwai weak and indecis __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ it is resolv that move event in our direct __PUNCT__ and strength that keep the peac __PUNCT__
i will not surrend america leadership in the world __PUNCT__
we must have confid in our caus __PUNCT__ clariti in our purpos __PUNCT__ and resolv in our might __PUNCT__
thi is veri simpl __PUNCT__ if you do not want america to be the strongest nation on earth __PUNCT__ i am not your presid __PUNCT__
you have that presid todai __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ centuri can and must be an american centuri __PUNCT__
it began with terror __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ and econom calam __PUNCT__
it is our duti to steer it onto the path of freedom __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ and prosper __PUNCT__
fewer member of the greatest gener ar with us todai __PUNCT__ and thei can't hold the torch as high as thei have in the past __PUNCT__
we must now seiz the torch thei carri so gallantli and at such sacrific __PUNCT__
it is an etern torch of decenc __PUNCT__ freedom and hope __PUNCT__
it is not america torch alon __PUNCT__
but it is america duti __PUNCT__ and honor __PUNCT__ to hold it high enough so that all the world can see it light __PUNCT__
believ in america __PUNCT__
thank you and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
