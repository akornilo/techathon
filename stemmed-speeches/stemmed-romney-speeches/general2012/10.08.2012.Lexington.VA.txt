hi commit to peac wa born of hi direct knowledg of the aw cost and consequ of war __PUNCT__
gener marshal onc said __PUNCT__ the onli wai human be can win a war is to prevent it __PUNCT__ those word were true in hi time __PUNCT__ and thei still echo in our __PUNCT__
last month __PUNCT__ our nation wa attack again __PUNCT__
a u. __PUNCT__ ambassador and three of our fellow american ar dead __PUNCT__ murder in benghazi __PUNCT__ libya __PUNCT__
among the dead were three veteran __PUNCT__
all of them were fine men __PUNCT__ on a mission of peac and friendship to a nation that dearli long for both __PUNCT__
presid obama ha said that ambassador chri steven and hi colleagu repres the best of america __PUNCT__
and he is right __PUNCT__
we all mourn their loss __PUNCT__
the attack against us in libya were not an isol incid __PUNCT__
thei were accompani by anti __PUNCT__ american riot in nearli two dozen other countri __PUNCT__ mostli in the middl east __PUNCT__ but also in africa and asia __PUNCT__
our embassi have been attack __PUNCT__
our flag ha been burn __PUNCT__
mani of our citizen have been threaten and driven from their oversea home by viciou mob __PUNCT__ shout __PUNCT__ death to america __PUNCT__ these mob hoist the black banner of islam extrem over american embassi on the anniversari of the __DATE__ attack __PUNCT__
as the dust settl __PUNCT__ as the murder ar buri __PUNCT__ american ar ask how thi happen __PUNCT__ how the threat we face have grown so much wors __PUNCT__ and what thi call on america to do __PUNCT__
these ar the right question __PUNCT__
and i have come here todai to offer a larger perspect on these tragic recent event __PUNCT__ and to share with you __PUNCT__ and all american __PUNCT__ my vision for a freer __PUNCT__ more prosper __PUNCT__ and more peac world __PUNCT__
the attack on america last month should not be seen as random act __PUNCT__
thei ar express of a larger struggl that is plai out across the broader middl east __PUNCT__ a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheav in a centuri __PUNCT__
and the fault line of thi struggl can be seen clearli in benghazi itself __PUNCT__
the attack on our consul in benghazi on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ wa like the work of forc affili with those that attack our homeland on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
thi latest assault cannot be blame on a reprehens video insult islam __PUNCT__ despit the administr attempt to convinc us of that for so long __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ as the administr ha final conced __PUNCT__ these attack were the deliber work of terrorist who us violenc to impos their dark ideolog on other __PUNCT__ especi women and girl __PUNCT__ who ar fight to control much of the middl east todai __PUNCT__ and who seek to wage perpetu war on the west __PUNCT__
we saw all of thi in benghazi last month __PUNCT__ but we also saw someth els __PUNCT__ someth hope __PUNCT__
after the attack on our consul __PUNCT__ ten of thousand of libyan __PUNCT__ most of them young peopl __PUNCT__ held a massiv protest in benghazi against the veri extremist who murder our peopl __PUNCT__
thei wave sign that read __PUNCT__ the ambassador wa libya friend __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ libya is sorri __PUNCT__ thei chant __PUNCT__ no to militia __PUNCT__ thei march __PUNCT__ unarm __PUNCT__ to the terrorist compound __PUNCT__
then thei burn it to the ground __PUNCT__
as on libyan woman said __PUNCT__ we ar not go to go from dark to dark __PUNCT__
thi is the struggl that is now shake the entir middl east to it foundat __PUNCT__
it is the struggl of million and million of peopl __PUNCT__ men and women __PUNCT__ young and old __PUNCT__ muslim __PUNCT__ christian and non __PUNCT__ believ __PUNCT__ all of whom have had enough of the dark __PUNCT__
it is a struggl for the digniti that come with freedom __PUNCT__ and opportun __PUNCT__ and the right to live under law of our own make __PUNCT__
it is a struggl that ha unfold under green banner in the street of iran __PUNCT__ in the public squar of tunisia and egypt and yemen __PUNCT__ and in the fight for liberti in iraq __PUNCT__ and afghanistan __PUNCT__ and libya __PUNCT__ and now syria __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ it is a struggl between liberti and tyranni __PUNCT__ justic and oppress __PUNCT__ hope and despair __PUNCT__
we have seen thi struggl befor __PUNCT__
it would be familiar to georg marshal __PUNCT__
in hi time __PUNCT__ in the ash of world war __PUNCT__ anoth critic part of the world wa torn between democraci and despot __PUNCT__
fortun __PUNCT__ we had leader of courag and vision __PUNCT__ both republican and democrat __PUNCT__ who knew that america had to support friend who share our valu __PUNCT__ and prevent todai crise from becom tomorrow conflict __PUNCT__
statesmen like marshal ralli our nation to rise to it respons as the leader of the free world __PUNCT__
we help our friend to build and sustain free societi and free market __PUNCT__
we defend our friend __PUNCT__ and ourselv __PUNCT__ from our common enemi __PUNCT__
we led __PUNCT__
and though the path wa long and uncertain __PUNCT__ the thought of war in europ is as inconceiv todai as it seem inevit in the last centuri __PUNCT__
thi is what make america except __PUNCT__ it is not just the charact of our countri __PUNCT__ it is the record of our accomplish __PUNCT__
america ha a proud histori of strong __PUNCT__ confid __PUNCT__ principl global leadership __PUNCT__ a histori that ha been written by patriot of both parti __PUNCT__
that is america at it best __PUNCT__
and it is the standard by which we measur everi presid __PUNCT__ as well as anyon who wish to be presid __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ thi presid polici have not been equal to our best exampl of world leadership __PUNCT__
and nowher is thi more evid than in the middl east __PUNCT__
i want to be veri clear __PUNCT__ the blame for the murder of our peopl in libya __PUNCT__ and the attack on our embassi in so mani other countri __PUNCT__ li sole with those who carri them out __PUNCT__ no on els __PUNCT__
but it is the respons of our presid to us america great power to shape histori __PUNCT__ not to lead from behind __PUNCT__ leav our destini at the merci of event __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ that is exactli where we find ourselv in the middl east under presid obama __PUNCT__
the relationship between the presid of the unit state and the prime minist of israel __PUNCT__ our closest alli in the region __PUNCT__ ha suffer great strain __PUNCT__
the presid explicitli state that hi goal wa to put __PUNCT__ daylight __PUNCT__ between the unit state and israel __PUNCT__
and he ha succeed __PUNCT__
thi is a danger situat that ha set back the hope of peac in the middl east and embolden our mutual adversari __PUNCT__ especi iran __PUNCT__
iran todai ha never been closer to a nuclear weapon capabl __PUNCT__
it ha never pose a greater danger to our friend __PUNCT__ our alli __PUNCT__ and to us __PUNCT__
and it ha never act less deter by america __PUNCT__ as wa made clear last year when iranian agent plot to assassin the saudi ambassador in our nation capit __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ when million of iranian took to the street in __DATE__ of __NUM__ when thei demand freedom from a cruel regim that threaten the world __PUNCT__ when thei cri out __PUNCT__ ar you with us __PUNCT__ or ar you with them __PUNCT__ the american presid wa silent __PUNCT__
across the greater middl east __PUNCT__ as the joi born from the downfal of dictat ha given wai to the painstak work of build capabl secur forc __PUNCT__ and grow economi __PUNCT__ and develop democrat institut __PUNCT__ the presid ha fail to offer the tangibl support that our partner want and need __PUNCT__
in iraq __PUNCT__ the costli gain made by our troop ar be erod by rise violenc __PUNCT__ a resurg al __PUNCT__ qaeda __PUNCT__ the weaken of democraci in baghdad __PUNCT__ and the rise influenc of iran __PUNCT__
and yet __PUNCT__ america abil to influenc event for the better in iraq ha been undermin by the abrupt withdraw of our entir troop presenc __PUNCT__
the presid tri __PUNCT__ and fail __PUNCT__ to secur a respons and gradual drawdown that would have better secur our gain __PUNCT__
the presid ha fail to lead in syria __PUNCT__ where more than __NUM__ men __PUNCT__ women __PUNCT__ and children have been massacr by the assad regim over the past __NUM__ month __PUNCT__
violent extremist ar flow into the fight __PUNCT__
our alli turkei ha been attack __PUNCT__
and the conflict threaten stabil in the region __PUNCT__
america can take pride in the blow that our militari and intellig profession have inflict on al __PUNCT__ qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan __PUNCT__ includ the kill of osama bin laden __PUNCT__
these ar real achiev won at a high cost __PUNCT__
but al __PUNCT__ qaeda remain a strong forc in yemen and somalia __PUNCT__ in libya and other part of north africa __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__ and now in syria __PUNCT__
and other extremist have gain ground across the region __PUNCT__
drone and the modern instrument of war ar import tool in our fight __PUNCT__ but thei ar no substitut for a nation secur strategi for the middl east __PUNCT__
the presid is fond of sai that __PUNCT__ the tide of war is reced __PUNCT__ and i want to believ him as much as anyon __PUNCT__
but when we look at the middl east todai __PUNCT__ with iran closer than ever to nuclear weapon capabl __PUNCT__ with the conflict in syria threat to destabil the region __PUNCT__ with violent extremist on the march __PUNCT__ and with an american ambassador and three other dead like at the hand of al __PUNCT__ qaeda affili __PUNCT__ it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the presid took offic __PUNCT__
i know the presid hope for a safer __PUNCT__ freer __PUNCT__ and a more prosper middl east alli with the unit state __PUNCT__
i share thi hope __PUNCT__
but hope is not a strategi __PUNCT__
we cannot support our friend and defeat our enemi in the middl east when our word ar not back up by deed __PUNCT__ when our defens spend is be arbitrarili and deepli cut __PUNCT__ when we have no trade agenda to speak of __PUNCT__ and the percept of our strategi is not on of partnership __PUNCT__ but of passiv __PUNCT__
the greater tragedi of it all is that we ar miss an histor opportun to win new friend who share our valu in the middl east __PUNCT__ friend who ar fight for their own futur against the veri same violent extremist __PUNCT__ and evil tyrant __PUNCT__ and angri mob who seek to harm us __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ so mani of these peopl who could be our friend feel that our presid is indiffer to their quest for freedom and digniti __PUNCT__
as on syrian woman put it __PUNCT__ we will not forget that you forgot about us __PUNCT__
it is time to chang cours in the middl east __PUNCT__
that cours should be organ around these bedrock principl __PUNCT__ america must have confid in our caus __PUNCT__ clariti in our purpos and resolv in our might __PUNCT__
no friend of america will question our commit to support them __PUNCT__ no enemi that attack america will question our resolv to defeat them __PUNCT__ and no on anywher __PUNCT__ friend or foe __PUNCT__ will doubt america capabl to back up our word __PUNCT__
i will put the leader of iran on notic that the unit state and our friend and alli will prevent them from acquir nuclear weapon capabl __PUNCT__
i will not hesit to impos new sanction on iran __PUNCT__ and will tighten the sanction we current have __PUNCT__
i will restor the perman presenc of aircraft carrier task forc in both the eastern mediterranean and the gulf region __PUNCT__ and work with israel to increas our militari assist and coordin __PUNCT__
for the sake of peac __PUNCT__ we must make clear to iran through action __PUNCT__ not just word __PUNCT__ that their nuclear pursuit will not be toler __PUNCT__
i will reaffirm our histor ti to israel and our abid commit to it secur __PUNCT__ the world must never see ani daylight between our two nation __PUNCT__
i will deepen our critic cooper with our partner in the gulf __PUNCT__
and i will roll back presid obama deep and arbitrari cut to our nation defens that would devast our militari __PUNCT__
i will make the critic defens invest that we need to remain secur __PUNCT__
the decis we make todai will determin our abil to protect america tomorrow __PUNCT__
the first purpos of a strong militari is to prevent war __PUNCT__
the size of our navi is at level not seen sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i will restor our navi to the size need to fulfil our mission by build __NUM__ ship per year __PUNCT__ includ three submarin __PUNCT__
i will implement effect missil defens to protect against threat __PUNCT__
and on thi __PUNCT__ there will be no flexibl with vladimir putin __PUNCT__
and i will call on our nato alli to keep the greatest militari allianc in histori strong by honor their commit to each devot __NUM__ percent of their gdp to secur spend __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ onli __NUM__ of the __NUM__ nato nation meet thi benchmark __PUNCT__
i will make further reform to our foreign assist to creat incent for good govern __PUNCT__ free enterpris __PUNCT__ and greater trade __PUNCT__ in the middl east and beyond __PUNCT__
i will organ all assist effort in the greater middl east under on offici with respons and account to priorit effort and produc result __PUNCT__
i will ralli our friend and alli to match our generos with their __PUNCT__
and i will make it clear to the recipi of our aid that __PUNCT__ in return for our materi support __PUNCT__ thei must meet the respons of everi decent modern govern __PUNCT__ to respect the right of all of their citizen __PUNCT__ includ women and minor __PUNCT__ to ensur space for civil societi __PUNCT__ a free media __PUNCT__ polit parti __PUNCT__ and an independ judiciari __PUNCT__ and to abid by their intern commit to protect our diplomat and our properti __PUNCT__
i will champion free trade and restor it as a critic element of our strategi __PUNCT__ both in the middl east and across the world __PUNCT__
the presid ha not sign on new free trade agreement in the past four year __PUNCT__
i will revers that failur __PUNCT__
i will work with nation around the world that ar commit to the principl of free enterpris __PUNCT__ expand exist relationship and establish new on __PUNCT__
i will support friend across the middl east who share our valu __PUNCT__ but need help defend them and their sovereignti against our common enemi __PUNCT__
in libya __PUNCT__ i will support the libyan peopl effort to forg a last govern that repres all of them __PUNCT__ and i will vigor pursu the terrorist who attack our consul in benghazi and kill american __PUNCT__
in egypt __PUNCT__ i will us our influenc __PUNCT__ includ clear condit on our aid __PUNCT__ to urg the new govern to repres all egyptian __PUNCT__ to build democrat institut __PUNCT__ and to maintain it peac treati with israel __PUNCT__
and we must persuad our friend and alli to place similar stipul on their aid __PUNCT__
in syria __PUNCT__ i will work with our partner to identifi and organ those member of the opposit who share our valu and ensur thei obtain the arm thei need to defeat assad tank __PUNCT__ helicopt __PUNCT__ and fighter jet __PUNCT__
iran is send arm to assad becaus thei know hi downfal would be a strateg defeat for them __PUNCT__
we should be work no less vigor with our intern partner to support the mani syrian who would deliv that defeat to iran __PUNCT__ rather than sit on the sidelin __PUNCT__
it is essenti that we develop influenc with those forc in syria that will on dai lead a countri that sit at the heart of the middl east __PUNCT__
and in afghanistan __PUNCT__ i will pursu a real and success transit to afghan secur forc by the end of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
presid obama would have you believ that anyon who disagre with hi decis in afghanistan is argu for endless war __PUNCT__
but the rout to more war __PUNCT__ and to potenti attack here at home __PUNCT__ is a polit time retreat that abandon the afghan peopl to the same extremist who ravag their countri and us it to launch the attack of 9/11 __PUNCT__
i will evalu condit on the ground and weigh the best advic of our militari command __PUNCT__
and i will affirm that my duti is not to my polit prospect __PUNCT__ but to the secur of the nation __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i will recommit america to the goal of a democrat __PUNCT__ prosper palestinian state live side by side in peac and secur with the jewish state of israel __PUNCT__
on thi vital issu __PUNCT__ the presid ha fail __PUNCT__ and what should be a negoti process ha devolv into a seri of heat disput at the unit nation __PUNCT__
in thi old conflict __PUNCT__ as in everi challeng we face in the middl east __PUNCT__ onli a new presid will bring the chanc to begin anew __PUNCT__
there is a long for american leadership in the middl east __PUNCT__ and it is not uniqu to that region __PUNCT__
it is broadli felt by america friend and alli in other part of the world as well __PUNCT__ in europ __PUNCT__ where putin russia cast a long shadow over young democraci __PUNCT__ and where our oldest alli have been told we ar __PUNCT__ pivot __PUNCT__ awai from them __PUNCT__ in asia and across the pacif __PUNCT__ where china recent assert is send chill through the region __PUNCT__ and here in our own hemispher __PUNCT__ where our neighbor in latin america want to resist the fail ideolog of hugo chavez and the castro brother and deepen ti with the unit state on trade __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ and secur __PUNCT__
but in all of these place __PUNCT__ just as in the middl east __PUNCT__ the question is ask __PUNCT__ where doe america stand __PUNCT__
i know mani american ar ask a differ question __PUNCT__ why us __PUNCT__ i know mani american ar ask whether our countri todai __PUNCT__ with our ail economi __PUNCT__ and our massiv debt __PUNCT__ and after __NUM__ year at war __PUNCT__ is still capabl of lead __PUNCT__
i believ that if america doe not lead __PUNCT__ other will __PUNCT__ other who do not share our interest and our valu __PUNCT__ and the world will grow darker __PUNCT__ for our friend and for us __PUNCT__
america secur and the caus of freedom cannot afford four more year like the last four year __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i believ the leader of the free world ha a duti __PUNCT__ to our citizen __PUNCT__ and to our friend everywher __PUNCT__ to us america great influenc __PUNCT__ wise __PUNCT__ with solemn and without fals pride __PUNCT__ but also firmli and activ __PUNCT__ to shape event in wai that secur our interest __PUNCT__ further our valu __PUNCT__ prevent conflict __PUNCT__ and make the world better __PUNCT__ not perfect __PUNCT__ but better __PUNCT__
our friend and alli across the globe do not want less american leadership __PUNCT__
thei want more __PUNCT__ more of our moral support __PUNCT__ more of our secur cooper __PUNCT__ more of our trade __PUNCT__ and more of our assist in build free societi and thrive economi __PUNCT__
so mani peopl across the world still look to america as the best hope of humankind __PUNCT__
so mani peopl still have faith in america __PUNCT__
we must show them that we still have faith in ourselv __PUNCT__ that we have the will and the wisdom to reviv our stagnant economi __PUNCT__ to roll back our unsustain debt __PUNCT__ to reform our govern __PUNCT__ to revers the catastroph cut now threaten our nation defens __PUNCT__ to renew the sourc of our great power __PUNCT__ and to lead the cours of human event __PUNCT__
sir winston churchil onc said of georg marshal __PUNCT__ he __PUNCT__ alwai fought victori against defeat __PUNCT__ discourag __PUNCT__ and disillus __PUNCT__ that is the role our friend want america to plai again __PUNCT__
and it is the role we must plai __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ centuri can and must be an american centuri __PUNCT__
it began with terror __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ and econom calam __PUNCT__
it is our duti to steer it onto the path of freedom __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ and prosper __PUNCT__
the torch america carri is on of decenc and hope __PUNCT__
it is not america torch alon __PUNCT__
but it is america duti __PUNCT__ and honor __PUNCT__ to hold it high enough that all the world can see it light __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ god bless you __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
