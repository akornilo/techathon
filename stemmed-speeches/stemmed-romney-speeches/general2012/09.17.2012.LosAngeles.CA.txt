the number of peopl on food stamp ha risen by almost __NUM__ million sinc presid obama took offic __PUNCT__
median household incom ha fallen four year in a row __PUNCT__
see such a poor job and incom pictur __PUNCT__ the feder reserv ha announc that it will onc again print more monei __PUNCT__
the fed know thi come with a high cost and risk for the futur __PUNCT__ but it feel it ha no choic __PUNCT__ our leader in washington have fail to produc a real recoveri __PUNCT__
no on is exempt from the pain of thi economi __PUNCT__ but the hispan commun ha been particularli hard hit __PUNCT__
while nation unemploy is __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ hispan unemploy is over __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
over two million more hispan ar live in poverti todai than the dai presid obama took offic __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ candid obama promis us a world of limitless hope __PUNCT__
what we got instead is a world where hope ha pain limit __PUNCT__ limit that make it harder to start a busi __PUNCT__ to grow a busi __PUNCT__ or to find a job __PUNCT__
the administr promis us that it polici would have brought unemploy down to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ by now __PUNCT__
thei have not __PUNCT__
unemploy is still abov __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and the differ between the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thei promis and the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ thei deliv is __NUM__ million more american not work __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million __PUNCT__
i expect the presid __PUNCT__ at hi convent __PUNCT__ to talk about the unemploi and to unveil a job plan __PUNCT__
astonishingli __PUNCT__ he did not __PUNCT__
i have a plan __PUNCT__ and my plan for a stronger middl class will creat __NUM__ million job by the end of my first term __PUNCT__
and it will rais take home pai __PUNCT__
my plan is premis on the convict that it is freedom that drive our economi __PUNCT__ that free peopl __PUNCT__ creat free enterpris __PUNCT__ is what creat good job with good wage __PUNCT__
govern support the job creator __PUNCT__ but it cannot take their place __PUNCT__
my plan ha five step __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we will take full advantag of our oil __PUNCT__ ga __PUNCT__ coal __PUNCT__ nuclear power __PUNCT__ and renew to achiev north american energi independ in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
that will not onli give us the afford __PUNCT__ reliabl energi we need __PUNCT__ it will also creat nearli __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__
and it will help bring manufactur back to our shore __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we must give our fellow citizen the skill thei need for the job of todai __PUNCT__ and give our children the educ thei need for the career of tomorrow __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ too mani of our kid ar trap in fail school __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will fight to ensur that children from everi background receiv a qualiti educ __PUNCT__
i will empow the parent of our low __PUNCT__ incom and special __PUNCT__ need student to choos where their child goe to school __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ we will make trade work for america by forg new agreement with nation that plai by the rule __PUNCT__ while crack down on nation that do not __PUNCT__
we can jumpstart our economi by expand trade with latin america __PUNCT__ and our nation __NUM__ million hispan __PUNCT__ own busi will have the most to gain __PUNCT__
presid obama ha not initi a singl new trade agreement with latin america __PUNCT__
i will __PUNCT__
i will also pursu a comprehens strategi to confront china unfair trade practic from dai on __PUNCT__
presid obama mai think that announc new trade case less than two month from elect dai will distract from hi record __PUNCT__ but the american busi and worker struggl on an uneven plai field know better __PUNCT__
if i known all it took to get him to take action wa to run an ad cite hi inact on china cheat __PUNCT__ i would have run on long ago __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ we must cut the deficit and put america on track to a balanc budget __PUNCT__
i believ that it is immor for us to continu to spend more than we take in __PUNCT__ to pass massiv debt on to our children __PUNCT__
i like to spend some time talk about thi issu in particular __PUNCT__
as businessmen and women __PUNCT__ and as hispan __PUNCT__ you understand the threat presid obama spend pose for our futur __PUNCT__
mani hispan have sacrif greatli to help build our countri and our economi __PUNCT__ and to leav for their children a brighter futur __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ those sacrific ar be put at risk by a presid who cannot stop spend __PUNCT__
the presid like to claim he will reduc the deficit by __MONEY__ trillion __PUNCT__
what he doesn't tell you is that he includ over __MONEY__ trillion in spend cut that have alreadi been enact __PUNCT__ or that he count deficit reduct for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
ye that right __PUNCT__ __NUM__ year after he leav offic __PUNCT__ even if he reelect __PUNCT__
under presid obama __PUNCT__ feder spend peak at __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of gdp __PUNCT__ a level not seen sinc world war ii __PUNCT__
i propos to bring feder spend back to it histor level __PUNCT__ about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of gdp __PUNCT__ and cap it there __PUNCT__
i will pursu a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ cut in non __PUNCT__ secur discretionari spend on my first dai in offic __PUNCT__
it time for a presid who is commit to cut spend and balanc our budget __PUNCT__
i know how to balanc budget __PUNCT__
we balanc our budget in my busi __PUNCT__ at the olymp __PUNCT__ and everi year in my state __PUNCT__
i will put the feder govern on a track to a balanc budget by elimin program that ar not absolut essenti and cut feder subsidi for thing like amtrak __PUNCT__ the corpor for public broadcast __PUNCT__ the legal servic corpor __PUNCT__ and the nation endow for the art and human __PUNCT__
i like some of these thing but we just can't afford them __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ my test is thi __PUNCT__ is the program so critic that it is worth borrow monei from china to pai for it __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ i will send a number of program that have been grow uncontrol fast back to the state where i will limit their fund growth to the rate of inflat __PUNCT__ or in the case of medicaid __PUNCT__ to inflat plu on percent __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ i will look to sharpli increas the product of washington by reduc feder govern employ by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ through attrit __PUNCT__ by combin agenc and depart to reduc overhead __PUNCT__ by crack down on the __MONEY__ billion a year in improp payment in govern program __PUNCT__ and by align govern compens with that of the privat sector __PUNCT__
these thing combin will reduc spend by about __MONEY__ billion a year by the end of my first term __PUNCT__
the presid ha put us on the road to greec __PUNCT__
i will put us back on the road to a stronger america __PUNCT__ on which stop spend more than we take in __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ to get our economi creat the job we need __PUNCT__ we must champion small busi __PUNCT__
i start a busi myself __PUNCT__
we began with ten peopl __PUNCT__ todai it emploi hundr of peopl __PUNCT__
we invest to help start up other small busi __PUNCT__
todai over __NUM__ peopl work at compani we help start __PUNCT__ compani like stapl __PUNCT__ bright horizon __PUNCT__ the sport author __PUNCT__ and steel dynam __PUNCT__
small busi often grow into larg busi __PUNCT__
two __PUNCT__ third of american job creat over the last __NUM__ year were creat by small busi __PUNCT__
i know small busi __PUNCT__ not becaus i studi it in school __PUNCT__ but becaus i live small busi __PUNCT__
and i know that small busi ar be crush by presid obama polici __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ govern regul treat busi like the enemi __PUNCT__ and thei crush them with an avalanch of regul __PUNCT__
and then there ar tax __PUNCT__
i met an electron entrepreneur in st __PUNCT__ loui __PUNCT__
he said that he and hi son calcul how much thei paid to the govern in feder incom tax __PUNCT__ payrol tax __PUNCT__ state incom tax __PUNCT__ gasolin tax __PUNCT__ sale tax and real estat tax __PUNCT__
it amount to over half of what hi busi earn __PUNCT__
over half __PUNCT__ no wonder busi start __PUNCT__ up ar at a thirti __PUNCT__ year low __PUNCT__
but the presid plan to rais the feder incom tax on small busi even more __PUNCT__ from __NUM__ __PUNCT__ up to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
that will kill __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
a recent studi conclud that my plan to reduc the tax rate on small busi will instead creat __NUM__ million job __PUNCT__
and let talk about obamacar for a moment __PUNCT__ and how it is affect job __PUNCT__
the chamber of commerc survei __NUM__ of it member __PUNCT__
it found that three __PUNCT__ quarter of them said thei ar less like to hire peopl becaus of obamacar __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ i know that we need healthcar reform __PUNCT__ but obamacar is the wrong wai to go about it __PUNCT__
obamacar will replac consum choic with govern choic __PUNCT__ it will caus health insur premium to skyrocket __PUNCT__ and it is alreadi depress job creation __PUNCT__
i will repeal and replac obamacar with reform that increas choic __PUNCT__ slow down the runawai growth of insur cost __PUNCT__ and open the door to more new job __PUNCT__
i am confid that if we do those five thing __PUNCT__ take advantag of our energi resourc __PUNCT__ fix our school __PUNCT__ open more trade __PUNCT__ cut the deficit __PUNCT__ and champion small busi __PUNCT__ our economi and our job will come roar back __PUNCT__
we can do better than thi lacklust economi __PUNCT__
my confid come from the entrepreneur i have met across the countri __PUNCT__
we in a room full of hardwork entrepreneur right here __PUNCT__
martha de la torr is here __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ martha co __PUNCT__ found el clasificado __PUNCT__ a spanish __PUNCT__ languag weekli __PUNCT__
classifi ad __PUNCT__ now there a tough busi __PUNCT__
but martha adapt with the time __PUNCT__
she becam an expert in search engin market __PUNCT__
and she turn __URL__ into an onlin powerhous __PUNCT__
we join by anoth success entrepreneur __PUNCT__ doren dominguez __PUNCT__
doren overse on of the nation top construct manag firm __PUNCT__
she been collect so mani award for leadership thi year __PUNCT__ we lucki she didn't have a conflict on her calendar todai __PUNCT__
i believ in entrepreneur like martha and doren __PUNCT__
i believ the credit for their hard work goe to them __PUNCT__ not to the govern __PUNCT__
and i sure don't believ that the govern should take more of what thei earn awai from them __PUNCT__
thi is at the heart of the differ between presid obama vision and mine for the american economi __PUNCT__ he want govern to tax more and regul more becaus he believ govern can do a better job than you can __PUNCT__
i believ in you __PUNCT__
i believ you can do a better job than govern __PUNCT__
i believ that you __PUNCT__ and that your dream and freedom __PUNCT__ will build a stronger futur for all of us __PUNCT__ and for our children __PUNCT__
thi belief in free peopl and free enterpris is the american heritag __PUNCT__
thi is why america ha outperform the world __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ i want to sai a word about immigr __PUNCT__
american mai disagre about how to fix our immigr system __PUNCT__ but i think we can all agre that it is broken __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ republican and democrat seem to have been more interest in plai polit with immigr than with actual fix it __PUNCT__
candid obama said that on of hi highest prioriti would be to fix immigr in hi first year in offic __PUNCT__
despit hi parti have major in both hous of congress __PUNCT__ the presid never even offer up a bill __PUNCT__
like so mani issu confront our nation __PUNCT__ when it come to immigr __PUNCT__ polit ha been put ahead of peopl for too long __PUNCT__
i will work with republican and democrat to perman fix our immigr system __PUNCT__
we will never achiev a legal immigr system that is fair and effici if we do not first get control of our border __PUNCT__
i believ we can all agre that what we need ar fair and enforc immigr law that will stem the flow of illeg immigr __PUNCT__ while strengthen legal immigr __PUNCT__
i want to make the system far more simpl and transpar __PUNCT__ you shouldn't have to hire lawyer to find out how to legal immigr to the unit state __PUNCT__
i will shift our divers visa to instead bring togeth immedi famili member __PUNCT__
i will structur our temporari worker visa program so that it meet the need of our employ __PUNCT__
and if someon get an advanc degre __PUNCT__ i want them to stai here __PUNCT__ so i stapl a green card to their diploma __PUNCT__
america is a nation of immigr __PUNCT__ and immigr is essenti to our econom growth and prosper __PUNCT__
on million immigr legal enter america everi year __PUNCT__ the largest number of ani countri in the world __PUNCT__
i like that __PUNCT__
i want to preserv our heritag of robust legal immigr __PUNCT__
and i want to make sure that those who abid by the law and wait in line to immigr here legal ar not at a disadvantag __PUNCT__
that why i oppos amnesti __PUNCT__ becaus amnesti will make it harder __PUNCT__ not easier to strengthen our legal immigr system __PUNCT__
it also why my administr will establish an employ verif system so that everi busi can know whether the peopl it hire ar legal elig for employ __PUNCT__
if a busi cheat __PUNCT__ there will be strict penalti for that busi __PUNCT__
in the midst of a difficult re __PUNCT__ elect __PUNCT__ presid obama creat what he call a __PUNCT__ stopgap measur __PUNCT__ for children who were brought here illeg __PUNCT__ through no fault of their own __PUNCT__
instead of plai immigr polit with these children __PUNCT__ i will pursu perman immigr reform __PUNCT__ and i will start by ensur that those who serv in our militari have the opportun to becom legal perman resid of the countri thei fought to defend __PUNCT__
those who have risk their live in defens of america have earn the right to make their life in america __PUNCT__
i spoken often about how proud i am of my father __PUNCT__
he wa born to american parent live in mexico __PUNCT__
when he wa five __PUNCT__ thei left everyth behind __PUNCT__ and start over in the unit state __PUNCT__
my dad grew up poor __PUNCT__
but he believ in a countri where the circumst of on birth were not a barrier to achiev __PUNCT__ a place where hard work could turn dream into realiti __PUNCT__
he went from sell paint out of the trunk of hi car to becom the leader of a great car compani and the governor of a great state __PUNCT__
my wife ann father wa a first gener immigr __PUNCT__
he end up found a success manufactur compani that made compon and equip for ship in the unit state navi __PUNCT__
mani of you in thi room have similar stori __PUNCT__
that is the american stori __PUNCT__
it is a stori that is told over and over again __PUNCT__
it is the stori of the american dream __PUNCT__
the american dream is not gone __PUNCT__ it ha just been put a littl further from reach __PUNCT__
i know what it take to bring it back __PUNCT__ to have it inspir our children just as it inspir our father and mother __PUNCT__
thei sacrif so much __PUNCT__ so that we might have it as part of our live __PUNCT__
now it is our turn __PUNCT__ our respons to restor the opportun and prosper and dream that have invigor thi nation from it begin __PUNCT__
it a respons we must fulfil __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and god bless america __PUNCT__
