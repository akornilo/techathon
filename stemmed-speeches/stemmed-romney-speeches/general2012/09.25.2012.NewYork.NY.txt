thank you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__
i appreci the kind word and your invit here todai __PUNCT__
if there on thing we learn thi elect season __PUNCT__ it that a few word from bill clinton can do ani man a lot of good __PUNCT__
after that introduct __PUNCT__ i guess all i have to do is wait a dai or two for the bounc __PUNCT__
sinc serv as presid here in america __PUNCT__ presid clinton ha devot himself to lift the downtrodden around the world __PUNCT__
on of the best thing that can happen to ani caus __PUNCT__ to ani peopl __PUNCT__ is to have bill clinton as it advoc __PUNCT__
that is how needi and neglect caus have becom global initi __PUNCT__
it is that work that invit us here todai __PUNCT__
as i have watch the astound impact of thi initi from afar __PUNCT__ i have been impress by the extraordinari power you have deriv by har togeth differ peopl of differ background __PUNCT__ and differ institut of differ persuas __PUNCT__
you have fashion partnership across tradit boundari __PUNCT__ public and privat __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__ profit and nonprofit __PUNCT__ charit and commerci __PUNCT__
on a smaller scale __PUNCT__ i have seen partnership like thi work befor __PUNCT__
in massachusett __PUNCT__ two social pioneer brought corpor and govern and volunt togeth to form citi year __PUNCT__ the model for americorp __PUNCT__
i sat with then candid for presid bill clinton as he investig the life __PUNCT__ chang success which occur when young peopl came togeth for a year of servic __PUNCT__ link in team with corpor sponsor __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ as the head of the __NUM__ winter olymp game __PUNCT__ i saw again the stun success than come when the dispar element of a commun join togeth in uniti __PUNCT__ to overcom challeng that had seem insurmount befor __PUNCT__
the clinton global initi ha also demonstr the effect of entrepreneurship and social enterpris __PUNCT__
you endeavor to not onli comfort the afflict __PUNCT__ but to also chang live thorough freedom __PUNCT__ free enterpris __PUNCT__ and the incompar digniti of work __PUNCT__
free enterpris ha done more to bless human than ani other econom system not onli becaus it is the onli system that creat a prosper middl class __PUNCT__ but also becaus it is the onli system where the individu enjoi the freedom to guid and build hi or her own life __PUNCT__
free enterpris cannot onli make us better off financi __PUNCT__ it can make us better peopl __PUNCT__
our is a compassion nation __PUNCT__
we look around us and see wither suffer __PUNCT__
our heart break __PUNCT__
while we make up just __NUM__ percent of the world popul __PUNCT__ we donat nearli a quarter of all global foreign aid __PUNCT__ more than twice as much as ani other countri __PUNCT__
and american give more than monei __PUNCT__
pastor like rick warren lead mission trip that send thousand of american around the world __PUNCT__ bring aid and comfort to the poorest place on the planet __PUNCT__
american troop ar first on the scene of natur disast __PUNCT__
an earthquak strike haiti and care packag from america ar among the first to arriv __PUNCT__ and not far behind ar former presid clinton and bush __PUNCT__
but too often our passion for chariti is temper by our sens that our aid is not alwai effect __PUNCT__
we see stori of case where american aid ha been divert to corrupt govern __PUNCT__
we wonder why year of aid and relief seem never to extinguish the hardship __PUNCT__ why the suffer persist decad after decad __PUNCT__
perhap some of our disappoint ar due to our failur to recogn just how much the develop world ha chang __PUNCT__
mani of our foreign aid effort were design at a time when govern develop assist account for roughli __NUM__ percent of all resourc flow to develop nation __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of the resourc flow into the develop world come from the privat sector __PUNCT__
if foreign aid can leverag thi massiv invest by privat enterpris __PUNCT__ it mai exponenti expand the abil to not onli care for those who suffer __PUNCT__ but also to chang live __PUNCT__
privat enterpris is have a greater and greater posit impact in the develop world __PUNCT__
the john deer compani embark upon a pilot project in africa where it develop a suit of farm tool that could be attach to a veri small tractor __PUNCT__
john deer ha also work to expand the avail of capit to farmer so thei can maintain and develop their busi __PUNCT__
the result ha been a good invest for john deer and greater opportun for african farmer __PUNCT__ who ar now abl to grow more crop __PUNCT__ and to provid for more plenti live __PUNCT__
for american foreign aid to becom more effect __PUNCT__ it must embrac the power of partnership __PUNCT__ access the transform natur of free enterpris __PUNCT__ and leverag the abund resourc that can come from the privat sector __PUNCT__
there ar three __PUNCT__ quit legitim __PUNCT__ object of our foreign aid __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ to address humanitarian need __PUNCT__
such is the case with the pepfar initi __PUNCT__ which ha given medic treatment to million suffer from hiv and aid __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ to foster a substanti unit state strateg interest __PUNCT__ be it militari __PUNCT__ diplomat __PUNCT__ or econom __PUNCT__
and there is a third purpos __PUNCT__ on that will receiv more attent and a much higher prioriti in a romnei administr __PUNCT__
and that is aid that elev peopl and bring about last chang in commun and in nation __PUNCT__
mani american ar troubl by the develop in the middl east __PUNCT__
syria ha wit the kill of ten of thousand of peopl __PUNCT__
the presid of egypt is a member of the muslim brotherhood __PUNCT__
our ambassador to libya wa assassin in a terrorist attack __PUNCT__
and iran is move toward nuclear weapon capabl __PUNCT__
we feel that we ar at the merci of event __PUNCT__ rather than shape event __PUNCT__
i am often ask why __PUNCT__ and what can we do to lead the middl east to stabil __PUNCT__ to eas the suffer and the anger and the hate __PUNCT__
religi extrem is certainli part of the problem __PUNCT__
but that not the whole stori __PUNCT__
the popul of the middl east is young __PUNCT__ particularli compar with the popul of the west __PUNCT__
and typic __PUNCT__ these young peopl have few job prospect and the level of youth unemploy across the region ar excess and chronic __PUNCT__
in nation that have undergon a chang in leadership recent __PUNCT__ young peopl have greater access to inform that wa onc carefulli guard by tyrant and dictat __PUNCT__
thei see the good as well as the bad in surround societi __PUNCT__
thei can now organ across vast region __PUNCT__ mobil popul __PUNCT__
idl __PUNCT__ humili by poverti __PUNCT__ and crush by govern corrupt __PUNCT__ their frustrat and anger grow __PUNCT__
in such a set __PUNCT__ for america to chang live __PUNCT__ to chang commun and nation in the middl east __PUNCT__ foreign aid must also plai a role __PUNCT__
and the shape that role should take wa brought into focu by the life and death of muham bouazizi of tunisia __PUNCT__ the street vendor whose self __PUNCT__ immol spark the arab spring __PUNCT__
he wa just __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old __PUNCT__
he had provid for hi famili sinc he wa a young boi __PUNCT__
he work a small fruit stand __PUNCT__ sell to passer __PUNCT__ by __PUNCT__
the regular harass by corrupt bureaucrat wa elev on dai when thei took crate of hi fruit and hi weigh scale awai from him __PUNCT__
on the dai of hi protest __PUNCT__ wit sai that an offic slap bouazizi and he cri out __PUNCT__ why ar you do thi to me __PUNCT__ i a simpl person __PUNCT__ and i just want to work __PUNCT__
i just want to work __PUNCT__
work __PUNCT__
that must be at the heart of our effort to help peopl build economi that can creat job for peopl __PUNCT__ young and old alik __PUNCT__
work build self __PUNCT__ esteem __PUNCT__
it transform mind from fantasi and fanatic to realiti and ground __PUNCT__
work will not long toler corrupt nor quietli endur the brazen theft by govern of the product of hard __PUNCT__ work men and women __PUNCT__
to foster work and enterpris in the middl east and in other develop countri __PUNCT__ i will initi __PUNCT__ prosper pact __PUNCT__ work with the privat sector __PUNCT__ the program will identifi the barrier to invest __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ and entrepreneuri in develop nation __PUNCT__
in exchang for remov those barrier and open their market to u. __PUNCT__ invest and trade __PUNCT__ develop nation will receiv u. __PUNCT__ assist packag focus on develop the institut of liberti __PUNCT__ the rule of law __PUNCT__ and properti right __PUNCT__
we will focu our effort on small and medium __PUNCT__ size busi __PUNCT__
microfin ha been an effect tool at promot enterpris and prosper __PUNCT__ but we must expand support to small and medium __PUNCT__ size busi that ar too larg for microfin __PUNCT__ but too small for tradit bank __PUNCT__
the aim of a much larger share of our aid must be the promot of work and the foster of free enterpris __PUNCT__
noth we can do as a nation will chang live and nation more effect and perman than share the insight that li at the foundat of america own economi __PUNCT__ free peopl pursu happi in their own wai build a strong and prosper nation __PUNCT__
when i wa in busi __PUNCT__ i travel to mani other countri __PUNCT__
i wa often struck by the vast differ in wealth among nation __PUNCT__
true __PUNCT__ some of that wa due to geographi __PUNCT__
rich countri often had natur resourc like miner deposit or ampl waterwai __PUNCT__
but in some case __PUNCT__ all that separ a rich countri from a poor on wa a faint line on a map __PUNCT__
countri that were physic right next to each other were econom world apart __PUNCT__
just think of north and south korea __PUNCT__
i becam convinc that the crucial differ between these countri wasn't geographi __PUNCT__
i notic the most success countri share someth in common __PUNCT__
thei were the freest __PUNCT__
thei protect the right of the individu __PUNCT__
thei enforc the rule of law __PUNCT__
and thei encourag free enterpris __PUNCT__
thei understood that econom freedom is the onli forc in histori that ha consist lift peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__ and kept peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__
a temporari aid packag can jolt an economi __PUNCT__
it can fund some project __PUNCT__
it can pai some bill __PUNCT__
it can emploi some peopl some of the time __PUNCT__
but it can't sustain an economi __PUNCT__ not for long __PUNCT__
it can't pull the whole cart __PUNCT__ becaus at some point __PUNCT__ the monei run out __PUNCT__
but an assist program that help unleash free enterpris creat endur prosper __PUNCT__
free enterpris is base on mutual exchang __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ rather __PUNCT__ million of exchang __PUNCT__ million of peopl trade __PUNCT__ bui __PUNCT__ sell __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ it ha it up and down __PUNCT__
it isn't perfect __PUNCT__
but it more durabl __PUNCT__
it more reliabl __PUNCT__
and ultim __PUNCT__ as histori show __PUNCT__ it more success __PUNCT__
the best exampl of the good free enterpris can do for the develop world is the exampl of the develop world itself __PUNCT__
my friend arthur brook of the american enterpris institut ha point out that befor the year __NUM__ live standard in the west were appal __PUNCT__
a person born in the eighteenth centuri live essenti as hi great __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ grandfath had __PUNCT__
life wa fill with diseas and danger __PUNCT__
but start in __NUM__ the west began two centuri of free enterpris and trade __PUNCT__
live standard rose __PUNCT__
literaci spread __PUNCT__
health improv __PUNCT__
in our own countri __PUNCT__ between __NUM__ and __NUM__ real per capita gdp increas twenti __PUNCT__ two __PUNCT__ fold __PUNCT__
as the most prosper nation in histori __PUNCT__ it is our duti to keep the engin of prosper run __PUNCT__ to open market across the globe and to spread prosper to all corner of the earth __PUNCT__
we should do it becaus it the right moral cours to help other __PUNCT__
but it is also econom the smart thing to do __PUNCT__
in our export industri __PUNCT__ the typic job pai abov what compar worker make in other industri __PUNCT__ and more than on __PUNCT__ third of manufactur job ar ti to export __PUNCT__
sadli __PUNCT__ we have lost over half a million manufactur job over the last three and a half year __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will revers thi trend by ensur we have trade that work for america __PUNCT__
i will negoti new trade agreement __PUNCT__ ask congress to reinstat trade promot author __PUNCT__ complet negoti to expand the tran __PUNCT__ pacif partnership __PUNCT__ and creat what i call a __PUNCT__ reagan econom zone __PUNCT__ where ani nation will to plai by the rule can particip in a new commun commit to fair and free trade __PUNCT__
i laid out a new approach for a new era __PUNCT__
we coupl aid with trade and privat invest to empow individu __PUNCT__ encourag innov __PUNCT__ and reward entrepreneur __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we face a world with unpreced challeng and complex __PUNCT__
we should not forget __PUNCT__ and cannot forget __PUNCT__ that not far from here __PUNCT__ a voic of unspeak evil and hatr ha spoken out __PUNCT__ threaten israel and the civil world __PUNCT__
but we come togeth know that the bitter of hate is no match for the strength of love __PUNCT__
in the week ahead __PUNCT__ i will continu to speak to these challeng and the opportun that thi moment present us __PUNCT__
i will go beyond foreign assist and describ what i believ america strategi should be to secur our interest and ideal dure thi uncertain time __PUNCT__
a year from now __PUNCT__ i hope to return to thi meet as presid __PUNCT__ have made substanti progress toward achiev the reform i outlin __PUNCT__
but i also hope to remind the world of the good and the big of the american heart __PUNCT__
i will never apolog for america __PUNCT__
i believ that america ha been on of the greatest forc for good the world ha ever known __PUNCT__
we can hold that knowledg in our heart with humil and unwav convict __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ and thank you all veri much __PUNCT__
