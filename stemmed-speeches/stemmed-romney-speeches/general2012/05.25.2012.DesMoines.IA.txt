so mani friend here hold a special place in my heart __PUNCT__
i come here todai to talk to you about an issu that affect the veri heart of america __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ iowa is much more than a collect of beauti farm and small town and citi bound by two of america great river __PUNCT__
iowa is a collect of the valu that built america and that have sustain us through good time and bad __PUNCT__
you know them well __PUNCT__ hard work __PUNCT__ take care of our neighbor __PUNCT__ famili __PUNCT__ faith in god and countri __PUNCT__
common sens __PUNCT__ kitchen tabl valu __PUNCT__
not fanci __PUNCT__ but endur __PUNCT__
these aren't the valu that lead to out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ control spend spree __PUNCT__ or to pile up massiv amount of debt you know your children __PUNCT__ and grandchildren __PUNCT__ will have to work all their live to pai off __PUNCT__
these aren't the valu of put off difficult decis with the hope that mayb someon els will solv them __PUNCT__
todai america face a financi crisi of debt and spend that threaten what it mean to be an american __PUNCT__
here in the heartland you know in your heart that it wrong __PUNCT__
we can't spend anoth four year talk about solv a problem that we know we ar make wors everi singl dai __PUNCT__
when the men and women who settl the iowa prairi saw a fire in the distanc __PUNCT__ thei didn't look around for someon els to save them or go back to sleep hope the wind might blow anoth direct __PUNCT__
thei knew that their surviv wa up to them __PUNCT__
a prairi fire of debt is sweep across iowa and our nation and everi dai we fail to act that fire get closer to the home and children we love __PUNCT__
thi is not sole a democrat or a republican problem __PUNCT__
the issu isn't who deserv the most blame __PUNCT__ it who is go to do what it take to put out the fire __PUNCT__
the peopl of iowa and america have watch presid obama for nearli four year __PUNCT__ much of that time with congress control by hi own parti __PUNCT__
and rather than put out the spend fire __PUNCT__ he ha fed the fire __PUNCT__
he ha spent more and borrow more __PUNCT__
the time ha come for a presid __PUNCT__ a leader __PUNCT__ who will lead __PUNCT__
i will lead us out of thi debt and spend inferno __PUNCT__
we will stop borrow unfathom sum of monei we can't even imagin __PUNCT__ from foreign countri we never even visit __PUNCT__
i will bring us togeth to put out the fire __PUNCT__
a lot of peopl think thi is a problem we can't solv __PUNCT__
i reject that kind of __PUNCT__ can't do __PUNCT__ defeatist talk __PUNCT__
it wrong __PUNCT__
what happen here isn't complic __PUNCT__
washington ha been spend too much monei and our new presid made thing much wors __PUNCT__
hi polici have taken us backward __PUNCT__
almost a gener ago __PUNCT__ bill clinton announc that the era of big govern wa over __PUNCT__
even a former mcgovern campaign worker like presid clinton wa signal to hi own parti that democrat should no longer try to govern by propos a new program for everi problem __PUNCT__
presid obama tuck awai the clinton doctrin in hi larg drawer of discard idea __PUNCT__ along with transpar and bipartisanship __PUNCT__
it enough to make you wonder if mayb it wa a person beef with the clinton __PUNCT__ but realli it run much deeper __PUNCT__
presid obama is an old school liber whose first instinct is to see free enterpris as the villain and govern as the hero __PUNCT__
america count on presid obama to rescu the economi __PUNCT__ tame the deficit and help creat job __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he bail out the public __PUNCT__ sector __PUNCT__ gave billion of dollar to the compani of hi friend __PUNCT__ and ad almost as much debt as all the prior presid combin __PUNCT__
the consequ is that we ar endur the most tepid recoveri in modern histori __PUNCT__
the consequ is that half of the kid graduat from colleg can't find a job that us their skill __PUNCT__
half __PUNCT__
the consequ is that retire can no longer get by on save and social secur __PUNCT__
the consequ is that the length of time it take an unemploi worker to find a job is the longest on record __PUNCT__
thi is why even those who vote for barack obama ar disappoint in him __PUNCT__
disappoint is the kei in which the presid re __PUNCT__ elect is be plai __PUNCT__
american will not settl for four more year of the same melancholi song __PUNCT__
we can and we must do better __PUNCT__
presid obama start out with a near trillion __PUNCT__ dollar stimulu packag __PUNCT__ the biggest __PUNCT__ most careless on __PUNCT__ time expenditur by the feder govern in histori __PUNCT__
and rememb thi __PUNCT__ the stimulu wasn't just wast __PUNCT__ it wa borrow and wast __PUNCT__
we still ow the monei __PUNCT__ we still pai interest on it __PUNCT__ and it be that wai long after thi presid end __PUNCT__
then there wa obamacar __PUNCT__
even now nobodi know what it will actual cost __PUNCT__
and that uncertainti ha slow our economi __PUNCT__
employ delai hire and entrepreneur put the brake on start new busi __PUNCT__ becaus of a massiv __PUNCT__ european __PUNCT__ style entitl that american didn't want and can't afford __PUNCT__
when you add up hi polici __PUNCT__ thi presid ha increas the nation debt by five trillion dollar __PUNCT__
let me put that in a wai we can understand __PUNCT__
your household share of govern debt and unfund liabil ha reach more than __MONEY__ under thi presid __PUNCT__
think about what that mean __PUNCT__
your household will be tax year after year with the interest cost of that debt and with the princip payment for those liabil __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ it won't be paid off by the adult in your household __PUNCT__
it will be pass along to your children __PUNCT__
thei will struggl throughout their live with the interest on our debt __PUNCT__ and presid obama is ad to them everi singl dai __PUNCT__
and that the best case scenario __PUNCT__
the interest rate on that debt is bound to go up __PUNCT__ like an adjust mortgag __PUNCT__
and there a good chanc thi debt could caus us to hit a greec __PUNCT__ like wall __PUNCT__
subprim mortgag came close to bring the economi to it knee __PUNCT__
thi debt is america nightmar mortgag __PUNCT__
it is adjust __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ monei down __PUNCT__ and assign to our children __PUNCT__
politician have been try to hide the truth about thi nightmar mortgag for year __PUNCT__ just like liar __PUNCT__ loan __PUNCT__
thi is not just bad econom __PUNCT__ it is immor __PUNCT__
dure my time in busi and in state govern __PUNCT__ i came to see the economi as have three big player __PUNCT__ the privat sector __PUNCT__ the state and local __PUNCT__ and the feder govern __PUNCT__
of these three __PUNCT__ the privat sector is by far the most effici and cost effect __PUNCT__
that becaus score of busi and thousand of entrepreneur ar compet everi dai to find a wai to deliv a product or a servic that is better than anyon els __PUNCT__
think about smart phone __PUNCT__
blackberri got thing go __PUNCT__
then appl introduc the iphon __PUNCT__
now the android platform lead the market __PUNCT__
in the world of free enterpris __PUNCT__ competit bring us better and better product at lower and lower cost __PUNCT__
innov and chang or you go out of busi __PUNCT__
and the custom __PUNCT__ us __PUNCT__ benefit __PUNCT__
govern doesn't begin to compar when it come to chang and improv that provid better and less expens servic and product __PUNCT__
but among govern __PUNCT__ the state and local ar more respons than the feder govern __PUNCT__ probabl becaus there is a degre of competit between them __PUNCT__
the slowest __PUNCT__ least respons sector is the feder govern __PUNCT__
nobodi hear __PUNCT__ washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ and think __PUNCT__ effici __PUNCT__
imagin if the feder govern wa the sole legal supplier of cell phone __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ thei still be under review __PUNCT__ with hear in congress __PUNCT__
when final approv __PUNCT__ the contract to make them would go to an obama donor __PUNCT__
thei be the size of a shoe __PUNCT__ with a collaps solar panel __PUNCT__
and campaign donor would be compet to becom the all __PUNCT__ power app czar __PUNCT__
my point is thi __PUNCT__ as presid obama and old __PUNCT__ school liber absorb more and more of our economi into govern __PUNCT__ thei make what we do more expens __PUNCT__ less effici __PUNCT__ and less us __PUNCT__
thei make america less competit __PUNCT__
thei make govern more expens __PUNCT__
what presid obama is do is not bold __PUNCT__ it old __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will make the feder govern simpler __PUNCT__ smaller __PUNCT__ smarter __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ more in keep with the vision of the framer of our constitut __PUNCT__
thi is why i do not __PUNCT__ for on moment __PUNCT__ share my oppon belief that our spend problem can be solv with more tax __PUNCT__
you do not ow washington a bigger share of your paycheck __PUNCT__
instead of put more limit on your earn and your option __PUNCT__ we need to place clear and firm limit on govern spend __PUNCT__
as a start __PUNCT__ i will lower feder spend to __NUM__ percent of gdp within four year __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ down from the __NUM__ percent todai __PUNCT__
the presid plan assum an endless expans of govern __PUNCT__ with cost rise and rise with the spread of obamacar __PUNCT__
i will halt the expans of govern __PUNCT__ and repeal obamacar __PUNCT__
work togeth __PUNCT__ we can save social secur without make ani chang in the system for peopl in or near retir __PUNCT__
we have two basic option for futur retire __PUNCT__ a tax increas for high __PUNCT__ incom retire __PUNCT__ or a decreas in the benefit growth rate for high __PUNCT__ incom retire __PUNCT__
i favor the second option __PUNCT__ it protect everyon in the system and it avoid higher tax that will drag down the economi __PUNCT__
i have propos a medicar plan that improv the program __PUNCT__ keep it solvent __PUNCT__ and slow the rate of growth in health care cost __PUNCT__
both of these reform ar rel simpl __PUNCT__ compar to the far more difficult choic we face if we do noth __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ medicar and social secur ar also easi to demagogu __PUNCT__ and i expect the presid to continu do that in thi campaign __PUNCT__
but american ar on to that game __PUNCT__ and i not go to insult voter by pretend that we can just keep put off entitl reform __PUNCT__
i will continu to speak honestli __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ if elect __PUNCT__ i will do what is right for the peopl of america __PUNCT__
the presid ha made littl effort to rein in redund and wast __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ the govern account offic found __NUM__ area where agenc __PUNCT__ offic __PUNCT__ or initi in the feder govern had overlap object or were provid similar servic __PUNCT__
the gao estim that fix thi redund could save over __MONEY__ billion __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ on year later __PUNCT__ onli three of these __NUM__ area had been fulli address __PUNCT__
onli on program wa actual defund __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ feder govern agenc gave __MONEY__ billion to more than __NUM__ unit nation program __PUNCT__ billion of it voluntarili __PUNCT__
anoth exampl __PUNCT__ there ar __NUM__ feder program in __NUM__ agenc that encourag __PUNCT__ green __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__
a report found that the result of their initi and invest ar __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ unknown __PUNCT__
we see the same bureaucraci and overhead in our anti __PUNCT__ poverti program __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ the feder govern spent more than __MONEY__ billion on more than __NUM__ differ program that aim to help the poor __PUNCT__
my approach to feder program and bureaucraci is entir differ __PUNCT__
move program to state or to the privat sector where thei can be run more effici and where we can do a better job help the peopl who need our help __PUNCT__
shut down program that aren't work __PUNCT__
and streamlin everyth that left __PUNCT__
it time for the peopl of america to take back the govern of america __PUNCT__
entitl reform __PUNCT__ do awai with redund and wast __PUNCT__ and shift servic and program to the econom player who can deliv them best __PUNCT__ these ar all seriou step toward get our debt and spend under control __PUNCT__
but abov all __PUNCT__ we need to shake off the static big __PUNCT__ govern mindset of these past few year __PUNCT__ and all the limit and regul that go with it __PUNCT__
we need a big turnaround here __PUNCT__ and it requir a focus __PUNCT__ unrel __PUNCT__ long __PUNCT__ term agenda for econom growth __PUNCT__
instead of lead the world in how much we borrow __PUNCT__ america must continu to lead the world in how much we build __PUNCT__ creat __PUNCT__ and invent __PUNCT__
with all that we been through these past few year __PUNCT__ the challeng can seem awfulli big __PUNCT__ and some might look at america and wonder if we have lost our confid __PUNCT__
but confid is not what is miss __PUNCT__
all that lack now is direct and leadership __PUNCT__
these have been year of disappoint and declin __PUNCT__ and soon we can put them behind us __PUNCT__
we can prosper again __PUNCT__ with the power recoveri we all been wait for __PUNCT__ the good job that so mani still need __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ abov all __PUNCT__ the opportun we ow to our children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
all of thi can be more than our hope __PUNCT__ it can be our futur __PUNCT__
it can begin thi year __PUNCT__ in the choic you make __PUNCT__ so i ask for your help __PUNCT__ your support __PUNCT__ and your vote on the sixth of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thank you all __PUNCT__ and god bless america __PUNCT__
