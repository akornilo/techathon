that part of why we face the slowest econom recoveri sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
and it why thi presid and hi parti have fail to address the most seriou problem face our countri __PUNCT__
when the presid took offic __PUNCT__ he face a job crisi __PUNCT__

he face a spend crisi __PUNCT__
it onli gotten wors __PUNCT__
and he face an educ crisi __PUNCT__
i love to stand here todai and join you in celebr the end of our educ crisi __PUNCT__
wouldn't it be great if we could look back on the last four year with confid that the crisi had been confront and we turn the corner toward a brighter futur __PUNCT__
but sadli __PUNCT__ that hasn't happen __PUNCT__
and the tragedi is not just a matter of test score and intern rank __PUNCT__
it the frustrat of a sixth grader who want to learn more __PUNCT__ but is stuck in a class that move too slowli __PUNCT__
it the embarrass of a __NUM__ grader who know he can't read the book he assign __PUNCT__
it the shame of a __NUM__ grader who suppos to be readi to graduat __PUNCT__ but hasn't master the skill he or she need to succe in life __PUNCT__
in thi countri __PUNCT__ we believ everi child ha someth to contribut __PUNCT__
no matter what circumst thei were born into __PUNCT__ everi child ha a dream about where thei can go or what thei can becom __PUNCT__
whether that dream is to invent someth __PUNCT__ start someth __PUNCT__ build someth __PUNCT__ or creat someth __PUNCT__ it all start with the basic skill and confid that onli a good educ can provid __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ too mani dream ar never realiz becaus our educ system is fail __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ our nation pioneer public educ __PUNCT__
we now fallen wai behind __PUNCT__
among develop countri __PUNCT__ the unit state come in __NUM__ of __NUM__ in read __PUNCT__ __NUM__ of __NUM__ in scienc __PUNCT__ and an abysm __NUM__ out of __NUM__ in math __PUNCT__
our public educ system is suppos to ensur that everi child get a strong start in life __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ on in four student fail to attain a high school degre __PUNCT__
and in our major citi __PUNCT__ half of our kid won't graduat __PUNCT__
imagin that __PUNCT__
imagin if your enterpris had a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ failur rate in meet it primari goal __PUNCT__
you would consid that a crisi __PUNCT__
you would make chang __PUNCT__ and fast __PUNCT__
becaus if you didn't __PUNCT__ you go out of busi __PUNCT__
but america public educ establish show no sens of urgenc __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ there is a fierc determin to keep thing the wai thei ar __PUNCT__
here we ar in the most prosper nation __PUNCT__ but million of kid ar get a third __PUNCT__ world educ __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ america minor children suffer the most __PUNCT__
thi is the civil __PUNCT__ right issu of our era __PUNCT__
it the great challeng of our time __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ i spoke about the prairi fire of debt that is spread across our countri __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ i want to talk about our crisi in educ __PUNCT__
with all of our econom troubl __PUNCT__ there a temptat to put off the task of fix our nation __PUNCT__ school for anoth time __PUNCT__
but the job and hous failur of these past few year onli make that task more import __PUNCT__
let not kid ourselv __PUNCT__ we ar in the midst of a nation educ emerg __PUNCT__
the onli reason we don't hear more about it is becaus our econom troubl have taken our nation attent awai from the classroom __PUNCT__
but if unemploy wa where it should be and home valu were go up __PUNCT__ there is no question that the crisi in american educ would be the great caus of thi campaign __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ the job and hous failur of these past few year onli make the need for educ improv all the more critic __PUNCT__
so i be blunt __PUNCT__ i don't like the direct of american educ __PUNCT__ and as presid __PUNCT__ i will do everyth in my power to revers thi declin __PUNCT__
much as you have in your own busi career __PUNCT__ i found that you can't expect dramat differ result unless you ar open to dramat chang __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will pursu bold polici chang that will restor the promis of our nation educ system __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i will expand parent choic in an unpreced wai __PUNCT__
too mani of our kid ar trap in school that ar fail or simpli don't meet their need __PUNCT__
and for too long __PUNCT__ we mere talk about the virtu of school choic __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will give the parent of everi low __PUNCT__ incom and special need student the chanc to choos where their child goe to school __PUNCT__
for the first time in histori __PUNCT__ feder educ fund will be link to a student __PUNCT__ so that parent can send their child to ani public or charter school __PUNCT__ or to a privat school __PUNCT__ where permit __PUNCT__
and i will make that choic meaning by ensur there ar suffici option to exercis it __PUNCT__
to receiv the full complement of feder educ dollar __PUNCT__ state must provid student with ampl school choic __PUNCT__
in addit __PUNCT__ digit learn option must not be prohibit __PUNCT__
and charter school or similar educ choic must be scale up to meet student demand __PUNCT__
instead of elimin the d.c __PUNCT__ opportun scholarship program as presid obama ha propos __PUNCT__ i will expand it to offer more student a chanc to attend a better school __PUNCT__
it will be a model for parent choic program across the nation __PUNCT__
parent choic will hold school respons for result __PUNCT__ but parent can onli exercis that choic effect if thei have good inform __PUNCT__
no child left behind help our nation take a giant step forward in bridg thi inform gap __PUNCT__
but the law is not without it weak __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will break the polit logjam that ha prevent success reform of the law __PUNCT__
i will reduc feder micromanag while redoubl effort to ensur that school ar held respons for result __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ parent shouldn't have to navig a cryptic evalu system to figur out how their kid __PUNCT__ school ar perform __PUNCT__
state must provid a simpl __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ read and wide avail public report card that evalu each school __PUNCT__
these report card will provid accur and easi __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ understand inform about student and school perform __PUNCT__
state will continu to design their own standard and test __PUNCT__ but the report card will provid inform that parent can us to make inform choic __PUNCT__
we will take bold step to ensur our system welcom and reward the best teacher __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will make it my goal to ensur that everi classroom ha a qualiti teacher __PUNCT__
there ar current __NUM__ program in ten agenc that spend __MONEY__ billion on teacher qualiti __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will consolid these program __PUNCT__ and block grant them to state that adopt innov polici __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ state will be reward if thei regularli evalu teacher for their effect and compens the best teacher for their success __PUNCT__
teach is a highli valu profess that must attract and retain the best and brightest __PUNCT__
dramat expand parent choic __PUNCT__ make school respons for result by give parent access to clear and instruct inform __PUNCT__ and attract and reward our best teacher __PUNCT__ these chang can help ensur that everi parent ha a choic and everi child ha a chanc __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ sinc we live in a twenti __PUNCT__ first centuri economi that increasingli demand a colleg educ __PUNCT__ effort at improv can't stop at high school end __PUNCT__
student must have access to a wide varieti of option that will give them the skill thei need for success career __PUNCT__
we must stop fuel skyrocket tuition price that put higher educ out of reach for some and leav other with crush debt __PUNCT__
these ar bold initi that will produc better outcom for our parent and teacher and student __PUNCT__
but accomplish real chang won't be easi __PUNCT__
effort to truli reform our school alwai meet strong resist from entrench interest __PUNCT__
the teacher union ar the clearest exampl of a group that ha lost it wai __PUNCT__
whenev anyon dare to offer a new idea __PUNCT__ the union protest the loudest __PUNCT__
their attitud wa memor express by a long __PUNCT__ time presid of the american feder of teacher __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ when school children start pai union due __PUNCT__ that when i start repres the interest of children __PUNCT__
the teacher union don't fight for our children __PUNCT__
that our job __PUNCT__
and our job keep get harder becaus the union wield outsiz influenc in elect and campaign __PUNCT__
annual __PUNCT__ mani teacher ar forc to pai almost __MONEY__ in union due __PUNCT__
the two major teacher union take in __MONEY__ million each year __PUNCT__
that more revenu than both of the polit parti combin __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ the nation educ associ spent more monei on campaign than ani other organ in the countri __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of those fund went to democrat __PUNCT__
educ is on issu where it should be easi to find common purpos and common solut __PUNCT__
and i believ the presid must be troubl by the lack of progress sinc he took offic __PUNCT__
most like __PUNCT__ he would have like to do more __PUNCT__
but the teacher union ar on of the democrat __PUNCT__ biggest donor __PUNCT__ and on of the presid biggest campaign support __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ presid obama ha been unabl to stand up to union boss __PUNCT__ and unwil to stand up for kid __PUNCT__
the most recent exampl is the opportun scholarship program __PUNCT__
sinc __NUM__ it allow thousand of children in the district of columbia to escap on of the worst school system in the nation and get a world __PUNCT__ class educ __PUNCT__
arm with scholarship of up to __MONEY__ student enrol in privat school __PUNCT__
__NUM__ __PUNCT__ of them were african american or hispan __PUNCT__
after three month __PUNCT__ student could alreadi read at level __NUM__ month ahead of their public __PUNCT__ school peer __PUNCT__
and parent were happi __PUNCT__ for everi spot in the program __PUNCT__ there were __NUM__ applic __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ senat durbin __PUNCT__ a democrat from illinoi __PUNCT__ insert a provis to end the program __PUNCT__
the white hous offer no resist __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the presid ha propos end all fund for opportun scholarship __PUNCT__
it must have gone against hi better instinct __PUNCT__ but the union want it so he went along __PUNCT__
in the opportun scholarship __PUNCT__ the democrat final found the on feder program thei ar will to cut __PUNCT__
why __PUNCT__ becaus success anywher in our public school is a rebuk to failur everywher els __PUNCT__
that why the union oppos even the most common sens improv __PUNCT__
in detroit __PUNCT__ student in the citi fail public school were offer a lifelin by a philanthropist who offer __MONEY__ million to creat __NUM__ charter school __PUNCT__
the teacher union made the state legislatur turn that gift down __PUNCT__
in connecticut __PUNCT__ parent group tri to pass __PUNCT__ parent trigger __PUNCT__ legisl so thei could take over and transform fail school __PUNCT__
a nation teacher union move fast to stop that __PUNCT__
now some union leader will tell you that their object ar misunderstood __PUNCT__
thei argu the issu ar complic __PUNCT__
but realli it simpl __PUNCT__ and it come down to thi __PUNCT__ when your caus in life is prevent parent from have a meaning choic or children from have a real chanc __PUNCT__ then you ar on the wrong side __PUNCT__
you might even be in the wrong vocat __PUNCT__ becaus good teacher put the interest of children first __PUNCT__
the same is true of a good presid __PUNCT__
in hi speech __PUNCT__ presid obama like to tell us __PUNCT__ we can't wait __PUNCT__ if onli he would sai that and mean it about educ reform __PUNCT__ becaus million ar wait for chang __PUNCT__ and so mani ar miss their chanc __PUNCT__
the presid can't have it both wai __PUNCT__ he can't talk up reform __PUNCT__ while indulg the group that block it __PUNCT__
he can't be the voic of disadvantag public __PUNCT__ school kid __PUNCT__ and the protector of special interest __PUNCT__
presid obama ha made hi choic __PUNCT__ and i have made mine __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will be a champion of real educ reform in america __PUNCT__ and i won't let ani special interest get in the wai __PUNCT__
we have to stop put campaign cash ahead of our kid __PUNCT__
thi is a battl we can and must win __PUNCT__
and while a lot need fix __PUNCT__ we get some of the most import thing right __PUNCT__
we have good teacher __PUNCT__ like the on who ar lead new york citi democraci prep __PUNCT__
becaus of them __PUNCT__ kid from the citi poorest commun ar outperform children from the wealthiest __PUNCT__
last summer __PUNCT__ these teacher took over the worst elementari school in harlem rather than let it shut down __PUNCT__
democraci prep is a testament to good peopl who refus to give up on our kid or leav our citi without a fight __PUNCT__
and leadership make a huge differ __PUNCT__
when jeb bush becam governor of florida __PUNCT__ read score of hispan student in that state school system were dismal __PUNCT__
he brought focus innov and passion leadership __PUNCT__
todai those score have risen dramat __PUNCT__
but too often __PUNCT__ new idea __PUNCT__ good teacher __PUNCT__ and dedic parent don't find a welcom partner and true champion in elect offici like governor bush __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ thei ar met with resist and resent from the establish __PUNCT__
i know what it is like to be a governor fight to do thing differ __PUNCT__
you need everi bit of help you can get __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i stand shoulder to shoulder with these reform and innov __PUNCT__
when i becam governor __PUNCT__ we were in the midst of institut tough __PUNCT__ bi __PUNCT__ partisan educ reform __PUNCT__
thei includ the requir that everi student pass a test to graduat from high school __PUNCT__
the test came under attack from the union __PUNCT__
but we stood our ground __PUNCT__
we also offer our best student a four __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ tuition __PUNCT__ free scholarship to the state colleg of their choic __PUNCT__
i call it the john and abigail adam scholarship __PUNCT__ after two massachusett citizen who understood the import of educ to our nation __PUNCT__
everi year i ask a school princip to invit the student who score in the top __NUM__ __PUNCT__ on the exam to a special assembl __PUNCT__
after some word about hard work __PUNCT__ i ask them to reach under their chair and remov an envelop that had been tape there __PUNCT__
and i watch as each of them would open the enclos letter __PUNCT__
everi year __PUNCT__ i stand in front of the room and the same scene would unfold __PUNCT__
at first __PUNCT__ you could hear a pin drop __PUNCT__
then each student ey would get big and proud smile would creep across their face as thei found out how well thei had done on the exam __PUNCT__
and then thei would read the part of the letter where thei learn thei earn an adam scholarship __PUNCT__
the smile turn into cheer __PUNCT__ and the sound wa deafen __PUNCT__
i got more hug on adam scholarship dai than i did at christma __PUNCT__
kid would bring me their cell phone so i could tell their parent the excit new __PUNCT__
and parent __PUNCT__ more than onc __PUNCT__ told me that thei had been worri thei would not be abl to afford colleg and that the scholarship would make a differ __PUNCT__
here in america __PUNCT__ everi child deserv a chanc __PUNCT__
it shouldn't be reserv for the fortun few __PUNCT__
if america is go to continu to lead the world in how much we build __PUNCT__ creat __PUNCT__ and invent __PUNCT__ then we must transform how we teach __PUNCT__ train __PUNCT__ and educ __PUNCT__
we alreadi have good teacher __PUNCT__ engag parent __PUNCT__ and big idea __PUNCT__
what we need now is strong leadership and the polit will __PUNCT__
a choic for everi parent mean a chanc for everi child __PUNCT__
that can be more than our hope __PUNCT__ it can be our futur __PUNCT__
it can begin thi year __PUNCT__ in the choic you make __PUNCT__ so i ask for your help __PUNCT__ your support __PUNCT__ and your vote on the sixth of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thank you all __PUNCT__ and god bless america __PUNCT__
