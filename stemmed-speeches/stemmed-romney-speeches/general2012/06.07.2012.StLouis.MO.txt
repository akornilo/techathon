thank you __PUNCT__
it is great to be here __PUNCT__
we launch thi campaign a littl over a year ago __PUNCT__
it been a remark journei __PUNCT__
i travel across thi great countri and had the privileg to visit with american from everi walk of life __PUNCT__
as those of the travel press corp can attest __PUNCT__ we brought our campaign to everi kind of busi imagin __PUNCT__ from factori floor to lumber yard to warehous of everi shape and size __PUNCT__
but whatev the busi __PUNCT__ everywher i go __PUNCT__ i hear frustrat and disappoint in the lack of econom progress of the past three and a half year __PUNCT__
american ar tire of be tire __PUNCT__
thei tire of work harder for less and now for the first time __PUNCT__ more american ar start to think our futur might not be as bright as our past __PUNCT__
that lack of faith in the futur is a bridg to despair that we cannot cross __PUNCT__
an america that doe not believ that tomorrow and tomorrow tomorrow will be better is not the america we know and love __PUNCT__
i spoken often of the presid failur of polici __PUNCT__
from the stimulu bill that gave us solyndra but left us with record unemploy __PUNCT__ to the job __PUNCT__ crush over __PUNCT__ regul of the epa __PUNCT__ to the smother econom effect of obamacar __PUNCT__ thi presid misguid polici have been muddl __PUNCT__ confus and simpli ineffect __PUNCT__
when you look around at america economi __PUNCT__ three and half year into thi presid __PUNCT__ it painfulli obviou that thi inexperienc presid wa simpli not up to the task of solv a great econom crisi __PUNCT__
but todai i want to speak to the road ahead and why i believ the disappoint of the past year have been a breach of faith with the american peopl __PUNCT__
america is rightli herald as the greatest experi in self __PUNCT__ govern in world histori __PUNCT__
we ar all here todai becaus of a startl convict that free individu could join togeth to decid their fate and that more freedom made us all stronger __PUNCT__
our exampl __PUNCT__ and commit __PUNCT__ to freedom ha chang the world __PUNCT__
but along with the geniu of our declar of independ __PUNCT__ our constitut __PUNCT__ and our bill of right __PUNCT__ is the equal geniu of our econom system __PUNCT__
our found father endeavor to creat a moral and just societi like no other in histori __PUNCT__ and out of that grew a moral and just econom system the like of which the world had never seen __PUNCT__
our freedom __PUNCT__ what it mean to be an american __PUNCT__ ha been defin and sustain by the liber power of the free enterpris system __PUNCT__
that same system ha help lift more peopl out of poverti across the globe than ani govern program or compet econom system __PUNCT__
the success of america free enterpris system ha been a bright beacon of freedom for the world __PUNCT__
it ha signal to oppress peopl to rise up against their oppressor __PUNCT__ and given hope to the onc hopeless __PUNCT__
it is call the free enterpris system becaus we ar both free to engag in enterpris and through those enterpris we ensur our freedom __PUNCT__
but sadli __PUNCT__ it ha becom clear that thi presid simpli doesn't understand or appreci these fundament truth of our system __PUNCT__
over the last three and a half year __PUNCT__ record number of american have lost their job or simpli disappear from the work forc __PUNCT__
record number of american ar live in poverti todai __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ million of our fellow american ar live below the poverti line __PUNCT__
thi is not just a failur of polici __PUNCT__ it is a moral failur of tragic proport __PUNCT__
our govern ha an absolut moral commit to help everi american help themselv and todai __PUNCT__ that fundament commit ha been broken __PUNCT__
i do not believ thi ha been done with evil intent or ill will __PUNCT__
but for a famili watch their hous be sold at foreclosur __PUNCT__ or the famili that is forc to spend their kid colleg save just to make end meet __PUNCT__ the result ar just as devast __PUNCT__
these ar not statist __PUNCT__ these ar our fellow american __PUNCT__
as your presid __PUNCT__ start on dai on __PUNCT__ i will do everyth in my power to end these dai of drift and disappoint __PUNCT__
there is someth fundament wrong when there ar over __NUM__ million american who ar unemploi __PUNCT__ underemploi __PUNCT__ or have stop look for work __PUNCT__ and yet the presid tell us he do a great job __PUNCT__
i will not be that presid of decept and doubt __PUNCT__
i will lead us to a better place __PUNCT__
for three and a half year __PUNCT__ presid obama ha expand govern instead of empow the american peopl __PUNCT__
he put us deeper into debt __PUNCT__
he slow the recoveri and harm our economi __PUNCT__
and he ha attack the cornerston of american prosper __PUNCT__ our econom freedom __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ govern at all level consum __NUM__ percent of the total economi or g.d.p __PUNCT__
if obamacar is allow to stand __PUNCT__ govern will reach half of the american economi __PUNCT__
and through the increas control govern ha impos on industri like energi __PUNCT__ financi servic and automobil __PUNCT__ it will soon effect control the major of our econom activ __PUNCT__
on must ask whether we will still be a free enterpris nation and whether we will still have econom freedom __PUNCT__
america is on the cusp of have a govern __PUNCT__ run economi __PUNCT__
presid obama is transform america into someth veri differ than the land of the free and the land of opportun __PUNCT__
we know where that transform lead __PUNCT__
there ar other nation that have chosen that path __PUNCT__
it lead to chronic high unemploy __PUNCT__ crush debt __PUNCT__ and stagnant wage __PUNCT__
i don't want to transform america __PUNCT__ i want to restor the valu of econom freedom __PUNCT__
so for everi govern __PUNCT__ spend propos __PUNCT__ i will ask the follow question __PUNCT__ is thi program so import that it is worth borrow more monei from china to pai for it __PUNCT__ with our nation face __NUM__ trillion dollar in debt __PUNCT__ most time the answer will be an easi and unqualifi __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ we seen how fast our debt can grow __PUNCT__
it time to see how fast our economi can grow __PUNCT__ and the first step is spend disciplin __PUNCT__
instead of throw more borrow monei at bad idea __PUNCT__ i will lower tax rate __PUNCT__ simplifi the tax code __PUNCT__ and get the american economi run at full strength __PUNCT__
under presid obama __PUNCT__ a singl __PUNCT__ massiv law ha spread so much uncertainti across the economi __PUNCT__ especi to the small compani that emploi about half of america worker and creat most of our new job __PUNCT__
thei have no idea how mani more tax and regul ar come __PUNCT__
and thei sens from washington an outright hostil toward what thei do and what thei hope to achiev __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ as presid __PUNCT__ i will begin with an equal big dose of certainti across our economi __PUNCT__ by grant waiver to all fifti state __PUNCT__ i will start the process of repeal obamacar on dai on __PUNCT__
in a free __PUNCT__ enterpris system __PUNCT__ we don't measur our success in equal outcom __PUNCT__ but instead in how well we preserv and promot the equal of opportun __PUNCT__
and thi system ha result in unriv prosper and made america the greatest nation in histori __PUNCT__
presid obama vision is veri differ __PUNCT__ and deepli flaw __PUNCT__
there is noth fair about a govern that favor polit connect over honest competit and take awai your right to earn your own success __PUNCT__
and there is noth moral right about try to turn govern depend into a substitut for the digniti of work __PUNCT__
where my vision believ in the ingenu of the american peopl __PUNCT__ hi vision trust the wisdom of polit appointe and board __PUNCT__ commiss and czar __PUNCT__
it on in which ordinari american must get permiss from peopl in washington befor thei can bui __PUNCT__ build __PUNCT__ invest or hire __PUNCT__
it a world of feder mandat and waiver __PUNCT__ tax credit and subsidi __PUNCT__ feder grant and loan guarante __PUNCT__
it an economi where a compani lobbyist will be more import than it engin __PUNCT__ and feder complianc lawyer will outnumb patent lawyer __PUNCT__
busi model base on build a better mousetrap will give wai to those that seek the right mix of govern subsidi __PUNCT__ waiver and loan guarante __PUNCT__
and chief govern offic will join the rank of chief financi offic and chief oper offic in corpor america execut rank __PUNCT__
presid obama trust in the wisdom of govern __PUNCT__
i put my trust in the ingenu and creativ and commit to hard work of the american peopl __PUNCT__
look at the sorri econom record of thi administr __PUNCT__ it easi to lose heart __PUNCT__ and even to give up __PUNCT__ as so mani have in their search for a job __PUNCT__
the presid and hi team would like us to believ that somehow it the fault of the free market that thing haven't gone right __PUNCT__
that just anoth wai of sai that it your fault __PUNCT__ and not their __PUNCT__ that the real recoveri hasn't yet arriv __PUNCT__
we have wait __PUNCT__ and wait __PUNCT__ and wait for recoveri __PUNCT__
and enough time ha pass to pronounc judgment on the econom polici of thi administr __PUNCT__
thei have not work __PUNCT__
and you __PUNCT__ the entrepreneur and worker of america __PUNCT__ have not fail these past three and a half year __PUNCT__ your govern ha fail you __PUNCT__
never befor ha feder polici run so contrari to the need __PUNCT__ ideal __PUNCT__ and aspir of the american entrepreneur __PUNCT__
and with all that we been through these past few year __PUNCT__ the challeng can seem awfulli big __PUNCT__
some might wonder if we have lost our confid __PUNCT__
but confid is not what is miss __PUNCT__ all that lack is direct and leadership __PUNCT__
thi presid believ in an america of limit __PUNCT__ where it is more import to focu on alloc the reward of success than help everyon succe __PUNCT__
that is an america of diminish opportun and increas disappoint __PUNCT__ of long unemploy line and small dream __PUNCT__
i believ in a veri differ america __PUNCT__
if we embrac the futur with leadership that doe everyth possibl to unlock the potenti of our econom might __PUNCT__ we can enter a new era of prosper the like of which we have never seen __PUNCT__
we cannot shy awai from great for fear that some might succe more than other __PUNCT__
just as everi american who can't find work make our light shine a littl less bright __PUNCT__ success breed success __PUNCT__
it not just our economi that is hurt __PUNCT__ it is our american spirit __PUNCT__
it doesn't have to be thi wai __PUNCT__
these have been year of disappoint and declin __PUNCT__ and soon we can put them behind us __PUNCT__
we can prosper again __PUNCT__ with the power recoveri we have all been wait for __PUNCT__ the good job that so mani still need __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ abov all __PUNCT__ the opportun we ow to our children and grandchildren __PUNCT__
all of thi can be more than our hope __PUNCT__ it can be our futur __PUNCT__
it can begin thi year __PUNCT__ in the choic you make __PUNCT__ so i ask for your help __PUNCT__ your support __PUNCT__ and your vote on the sixth of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thank you all __PUNCT__ and god bless america __PUNCT__
