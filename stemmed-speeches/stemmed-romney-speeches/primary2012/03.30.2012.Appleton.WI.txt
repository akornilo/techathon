no on can predict the crisi the next presid will confront nor what the world will look like at the end of the next presid term __PUNCT__
in a world in which the economi of athen __PUNCT__ wisconsin and athen __PUNCT__ greec ar connect __PUNCT__ everi decis becom infinit more complex __PUNCT__
but i believ american face a fundament choic in thi elect __PUNCT__ a decis that is much more import than the candid or the polit parti __PUNCT__
we should understand that we ar select not just who should guid us but a choic between two distinct path and destini for our nation __PUNCT__
in the dai and month ahead __PUNCT__ we should ask ourselv some veri fundament question about who we ar as a nation and who we ar becom __PUNCT__
what doe it mean to be an american in __NUM__ __PUNCT__ what will it mean in __NUM__ and beyond __PUNCT__ ar we keep faith with the great legaci __PUNCT__ and trust __PUNCT__ that ha been hand to us by previou gener __PUNCT__ and what america will we leav the next gener __PUNCT__
thi campaign will produc a deafen cacophoni of charg and counter charg and by __DATE__ __PUNCT__ most american will probabl be afraid to turn on their tv __PUNCT__
so now __PUNCT__ in thi quiet befor the storm __PUNCT__ let start with some basic fact about which there can be no debat __PUNCT__
sinc barack obama becam presid __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ american have lost their job __PUNCT__
million of american spent longer look for a job than ever befor __PUNCT__
long __PUNCT__ term unemploy is the worst sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ million american ar now live in poverti __PUNCT__ more than ever befor in our nation histori __PUNCT__

forti __PUNCT__ six and a half million american ar now on food stamp __PUNCT__ anoth record __PUNCT__
__NUM__ million home have been foreclos on __PUNCT__
new busi startup ar at the lowest level in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
over __NUM__ chrysler and gm dealership have close and __NUM__ automobil manufactur plant have been shutter or idl __PUNCT__
our yearli budget deficit ar soar and our nation debt now stand at an all __PUNCT__ time high __PUNCT__
barack obama presid over the first trillion __PUNCT__ dollar deficit in american histori __PUNCT__
and he ha repeat thi dread distinct for each year he ha been in offic __PUNCT__
for the first time sinc world war ii __PUNCT__ our nation debt is greater than the size of our entir economi __PUNCT__
each american share of the nation debt stand at __MONEY__
presid obama did not caus the recess __PUNCT__ but he most certainli fail to lead the recoveri __PUNCT__
hi stimulu protect the govern __PUNCT__ not the peopl __PUNCT__
it wa promis to hold unemploy below eight percent __PUNCT__
it did not __PUNCT__
barack obama stimulu wa as ineffect as it wa expens __PUNCT__
hi obamacar didn't help creat job either __PUNCT__
it discourag small busi and health compani from hire new worker __PUNCT__
and dodd __PUNCT__ frank hurt the commun bank that provid loan to small busi __PUNCT__
but the __PUNCT__ too big to fail __PUNCT__ bank ar even bigger todai __PUNCT__
he fail to deliv on job __PUNCT__ but on hi goal to rais energi price __PUNCT__ he sure came through __PUNCT__
all in all __PUNCT__ presid obama prolong the recess and slow the recoveri __PUNCT__
hi econom strategi is a bust __PUNCT__
these troubl fact ar presid obama legaci and now our share histori __PUNCT__
as much as we would like to __PUNCT__ we can't undo what ha happen these past year __PUNCT__
the famili who have lost their home __PUNCT__ the factori that have close __PUNCT__ the student who had to drop out of colleg and those who never could make it in the door __PUNCT__ all those miss chanc and lost opportun can't be regain __PUNCT__
and that why it is import to understand on astonish fact about thi elect __PUNCT__ presid obama think he do a good job __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i not kid __PUNCT__
he actual think he do a great job __PUNCT__
an histor great job __PUNCT__
accord to the presid __PUNCT__ onli lincoln __PUNCT__ fdr and lyndon johnson have accomplish more __PUNCT__
and no __PUNCT__ he didn't sai that on saturdai night live __PUNCT__
how can thi be __PUNCT__ is it that the presid is just so disconnect from what is happen across america that he doesn't grasp the real consequ of hi failur __PUNCT__
that answer is easi __PUNCT__
the answer is ye __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__
thi is a presid who wa elect not on the strength of a compel record but a compel person and stori __PUNCT__
there wa much about the campaign of barack obama that appeal to mani american __PUNCT__
and though the realiti ha fail the hope and chang he promis __PUNCT__ he remain surround by true believ who attack anyon who challeng their power __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as we see each dai __PUNCT__ thei will fight even more fierc to hold on to that power __PUNCT__
all of thi is to be expect __PUNCT__
that power love power and never let go easili is hardli new __PUNCT__
and that a white hous ha lost touch __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ i think we seen that onc or twice befor __PUNCT__
but we should also rememb that candid barack obama pledg that he want to __PUNCT__ transform thi nation __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ that is exactli what he ha been do __PUNCT__
and that is on more reason why thi elect is so critic __PUNCT__
the choic befor us could not be more profound __PUNCT__
barack obama and i have fundament differ vision for america __PUNCT__
he ha spent the last four year lai the foundat for a new govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__
i will spend the next four year rebuild the foundat of our opportun societi __PUNCT__ led by free peopl and free enterpris __PUNCT__
our differ vision for america ar the product of our valu and our life experi __PUNCT__
barack obama onc said that hi work as a commun organ motiv him to help __PUNCT__ commun that had been ravag by plant close __PUNCT__ hi desir to help other could not be more admir but it clear that he saw free enterpris as the villain and not the solut __PUNCT__
the onli real solut to help those commun devast by lost job is more job __PUNCT__
barack obama seem never to have understood the basic point that a plant close when a busi lose monei __PUNCT__
so when thi presid attack busi for make monei __PUNCT__ and when hi polici make it more difficult for busi to make monei __PUNCT__ he is also attack the veri commun he want to help __PUNCT__
that how it work in america __PUNCT__
or at least that how it work when america is work __PUNCT__
but under barack obama __PUNCT__ america hasn't been work __PUNCT__
the iron tragedi is that the commun organ who want to help those hurt by a plant close becam the presid on whose watch more job were lost than ani time sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
instead of do everyth possibl to promot the power of the free enterpris system to creat job and get us out of thi econom crisi __PUNCT__ barack obama ha promot the power of govern __PUNCT__
the result have been predict dismal __PUNCT__ but he ha __PUNCT__ transform __PUNCT__ us __PUNCT__ as he like to sai __PUNCT__ closer to hi vision of a govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ the govern must do more becaus the economi is doom to do less __PUNCT__
when you attack busi and vilifi success __PUNCT__ you will have less busi and less success __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ of cours the debat becom about how much to extend unemploy insur becaus you have guarante there will be million more unemploi __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ govern natur alloc the reward __PUNCT__
tax break ar bestow not to make us more product or to grow a stronger economi but to reshap the societi into what is current fashion and polit correct __PUNCT__
becaus busi is inher suspect __PUNCT__ govern regul who know better must overse and direct busi decis __PUNCT__ make __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ tax increas becom not onli a necess but also a desir tool for social justic __PUNCT__
in that world of shrink mean __PUNCT__ there a finit amount of monei __PUNCT__ and as someon onc famous said __PUNCT__ you need tax to spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ govern spend will alwai increas becaus there no reason to stop it __PUNCT__
there alwai someon who is entitl to someth more __PUNCT__ and who will vote for anyon who will give them someth more __PUNCT__
in a govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ govern dispens the benefit __PUNCT__ borrow what it can't take __PUNCT__ and consum a greater and greater share of the economi __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ govern at all level consum __NUM__ percent of the total economi or g.d.p __PUNCT__
if obamacar is allow to stand __PUNCT__ govern will directli control almost half of the american economi __PUNCT__
and through the increas control govern ha impos on industri like energi and financi servic __PUNCT__ and automobil __PUNCT__ it will indirectli or directli control well over half of our total economi __PUNCT__
on must ask whether we will still be a free enterpris nation and whether we will still have econom freedom __PUNCT__
america is on the cusp of have a govern __PUNCT__ run economi __PUNCT__
presid obama is transform america into someth veri differ than the land of the free and the land of opportun __PUNCT__
we know where that transform lead __PUNCT__
there ar other nation that have chosen that path __PUNCT__
it lead to chronic high unemploy __PUNCT__ crush debt __PUNCT__ and stagnant wage __PUNCT__
sound familiar __PUNCT__
i don't want to transform america __PUNCT__ i want to restor the valu of econom freedom __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ and small govern that have made thi nation the leader it is __PUNCT__
freedom and opportun have made america the most power economi in the world __PUNCT__
thei ar the foundat of a nation with full employ __PUNCT__ rise wage __PUNCT__ and fiscal stabil __PUNCT__
the best thing we can do for the econom well __PUNCT__ be of the peopl of america is not to grow govern __PUNCT__ it is to restor freedom and opportun __PUNCT__
it is opportun that ha alwai driven america and defin us as american __PUNCT__
my grandfath wa in the construct busi and he never realli made it himself __PUNCT__
but he help convinc my dad that he could accomplish anyth he set hi mind to __PUNCT__
my dad didn't have the chanc to finish colleg and he apprent as a lath and plaster carpent __PUNCT__
base on that excel train __PUNCT__ he went on to turn around a great car compani and later becam governor of michigan __PUNCT__
my father made the most of opportun that came befor him __PUNCT__ and by the time i came along __PUNCT__ i wa the fourth of four brother and sister __PUNCT__ i had the chanc to get the educ my dad couldn't __PUNCT__
i love car and wa tempt to stai in michigan and go into the car busi but i knew i would alwai wonder if ani success i had wa due to my father __PUNCT__
so when i got out of busi school __PUNCT__ i stai in massachusett and got an entri __PUNCT__ level job with the best compani that would hire me __PUNCT__
more importantli __PUNCT__ i wa marri and on the wai to have five son __PUNCT__
over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ my busi career had mani up and down __PUNCT__ great success __PUNCT__ definit failur __PUNCT__ but each step of the wai i learn more about the transform power of our great free enterpris system __PUNCT__
i not naïv enough to believ that free enterpris is the solut to all of our problem __PUNCT__ nor am i naïv enough to doubt that it is on of the greatest forc of good thi world ha ever known __PUNCT__
free enterpris ha done more to lift peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__ to help build a strong middl class __PUNCT__ to help educ our kid __PUNCT__ to make our live better __PUNCT__ than all of the govern program put togeth __PUNCT__
if we becom on of those societi that attack success __PUNCT__ on outcom is certain __PUNCT__ there will be a lot less success __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
the promis of america ha alwai been that if you work hard __PUNCT__ and took some risk __PUNCT__ that there wa the opportun to build a better life for your famili and for the next gener __PUNCT__
it not govern role to guarante that everi on of us will achiev the success we seek __PUNCT__
thi nation wa found on the principl that we have a god __PUNCT__ given right to pursu happi __PUNCT__
it is the pursuit that is guarante __PUNCT__ not the result __PUNCT__
it is the opportun that is guarante __PUNCT__ not the outcom __PUNCT__
we ar an opportun nation __PUNCT__
over the centuri __PUNCT__ men and women pursu happi in their own uniqu wai have made our the lead economi in the world __PUNCT__ and as we look to the futur __PUNCT__ i am absolut confid that the principl that creat our strength ar the veri on that will preserv it __PUNCT__
thi mean that govern must be smaller and have strict limit place on it power __PUNCT__
obamacar violat both principl __PUNCT__
i will repeal it __PUNCT__
tax should be as low as possibl __PUNCT__ in line with those of compet nation __PUNCT__ and design to foster innov and growth __PUNCT__
that why i will cut margin tax rate across the board __PUNCT__
regul ar necessari __PUNCT__ but thei must be continu updat __PUNCT__ streamlin __PUNCT__ and modern __PUNCT__
regul should see part of their job as protect econom freedom __PUNCT__ promot enterpris __PUNCT__ and foster job creation __PUNCT__
worker should have the right to form union __PUNCT__ but union should not be forc upon them __PUNCT__
and union should not have the power to take monei out of their member __PUNCT__ paycheck to bui the support of politician favor by the union boss __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ govern must make america the best place in the world for entrepreneur __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ small busi and big busi __PUNCT__ for job creator of all kind __PUNCT__
busi is not the enemi __PUNCT__
it is the friend of job __PUNCT__ of rise wage __PUNCT__ and of the revenu govern need to care for the poor and the elderli __PUNCT__ and to provid for the nation defens __PUNCT__
out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch liber like barack obama sai thei want a strong economi __PUNCT__ but thei realli don't like busi veri much __PUNCT__
but the economi is simpli the product of all the nation __PUNCT__ busi ad togeth __PUNCT__
so it like sai you love omelett but don't like egg __PUNCT__
to build a strong economi that provid good job and rise wage and that reduc poverti __PUNCT__ we need to build success busi of everi kind imagin __PUNCT__
and presid obama ha been attack success busi of everi kind imagin __PUNCT__
appl comput and microsoft weren't start to save the world and neither were gener motor or alcoa __PUNCT__
nor were some of the compani i help start like stapl or the sport author __PUNCT__
all of these great american enterpris were start becaus innov had great idea and great ambit __PUNCT__
thei becam great commerci ventur __PUNCT__ which is anoth wai of sai thei made a lot of monei __PUNCT__
not just for a few peopl but for mani peopl __PUNCT__
thei help peopl bui home __PUNCT__ go to school __PUNCT__ retir __PUNCT__ start other compani __PUNCT__
we have alwai been the countri where dreamer build dream and where on dream help launch anoth __PUNCT__
and if those dreamer ar reward with prosper __PUNCT__ we view that as a reason other would be encourag to dream big as well __PUNCT__
we have to understand that todai much of the world is hungri for the big dreamer with big idea __PUNCT__
america must fight to grow these dreamer and innov __PUNCT__ and to attract those from other land __PUNCT__
my father had a favorit sai __PUNCT__ noth is as vulner as entrench success __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ becaus america ha been so success for so long __PUNCT__ we seem to have forgotten what brought us here __PUNCT__
america ha becom vulner to new competit __PUNCT__ to loom debt __PUNCT__ and to those who would substitut more govern power for more freedom __PUNCT__
we have made some bad choic and ignor the mount threat __PUNCT__
but if the hill is a littl steeper befor us __PUNCT__ we have alwai been a nation of big stepper __PUNCT__
in thi last year __PUNCT__ i have been all over thi countri __PUNCT__ from student union cafeteria to kitchen tabl __PUNCT__ from factori breakroom to boardroom __PUNCT__ and i heard frustrat and anger but rare hopeless __PUNCT__
mani american have given up on thi presid but thei haven't ever thought about give up __PUNCT__
not on themselv __PUNCT__
not on each other __PUNCT__
and not on america __PUNCT__
we have a sacr duti to restor the promis of america __PUNCT__
and we will do it __PUNCT__
we will do it becaus we believ in america __PUNCT__
thi tuesdai __PUNCT__ join me __PUNCT__
join me in the next step toward that destin of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ when across america we can give a sigh of relief and know that the promis of america ha been kept __PUNCT__
the dreamer can dream a littl bigger __PUNCT__ the help want sign can be dust off __PUNCT__ and we can start again __PUNCT__
and thi time we get it right __PUNCT__
we stop the dai of apolog for success at home and never again apolog for america abroad __PUNCT__
togeth we build the greatest america we have ever known __PUNCT__ where prosper is grown and share __PUNCT__ not limit and divid __PUNCT__ an america that guarante that our is the door that innov and great alwai knock on first __PUNCT__
there wa a time __PUNCT__ not so long ago __PUNCT__ when each of us could walk a littl taller and stand a littl straighter becaus we had a gift that no on els in the world share __PUNCT__
we were american __PUNCT__
that meant someth differ to each of us but it meant someth special to all of us __PUNCT__
we knew it without question __PUNCT__
and so did the world __PUNCT__
those dai ar come back __PUNCT__
that our destini __PUNCT__

and take anoth step everi dai until __DATE__ __PUNCT__
we believ in america __PUNCT__
