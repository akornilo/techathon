thi would be a troubl and threaten world for america __PUNCT__
but it is not unrealist __PUNCT__
these ar onli some of the veri real danger that america face __PUNCT__ if we continu with the feckless polici of the past three year __PUNCT__
but of cours __PUNCT__ it doesn't have to be thi wai __PUNCT__
thi isn't our destini __PUNCT__ it is a choic __PUNCT__
we ar a democraci __PUNCT__
you decid __PUNCT__
in thi campaign for presid __PUNCT__ i will offer a veri differ vision of america role in the world and of america destini __PUNCT__
our next presid will face mani difficult and complex foreign polici decis __PUNCT__
few will be black and white __PUNCT__
but i am here todai to tell you that i am guid by on overwhelm convict and passion __PUNCT__ thi centuri must be an american centuri __PUNCT__
in an american centuri __PUNCT__ america ha the strongest economi and the strongest militari in the world __PUNCT__
in an american centuri __PUNCT__ america lead the free world and the free world lead the entir world __PUNCT__
god did not creat thi countri to be a nation of follow __PUNCT__
america is not destin to be on of sever equal balanc global power __PUNCT__
america must lead the world __PUNCT__ or someon els will __PUNCT__
without american leadership __PUNCT__ without clariti of american purpos and resolv __PUNCT__ the world becom a far more danger place __PUNCT__ and liberti and prosper would sure be among the first casualti __PUNCT__
let me make thi veri clear __PUNCT__
as presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ i will devot myself to an american centuri __PUNCT__
and i will never __PUNCT__ ever apolog for america __PUNCT__
some mai ask __PUNCT__ why america __PUNCT__ why should america be ani differ than score of other countri around the globe __PUNCT__
i believ we ar an except countri with a uniqu destini and role in the world __PUNCT__
not except __PUNCT__ as the presid ha deris said __PUNCT__ in the wai that the british think great britain is except or the greek think greec is except __PUNCT__
in barack obama profoundli mistaken view __PUNCT__ there is noth uniqu about the unit state __PUNCT__
but we ar except becaus we ar a nation found on a preciou idea that wa birth in the american revolut __PUNCT__ and propound by our greatest statesmen __PUNCT__ in our fundament document __PUNCT__
we ar a peopl who threw off the yoke of tyranni and establish a govern __PUNCT__ in abraham lincoln word __PUNCT__ of the peopl __PUNCT__ by the peopl __PUNCT__ and for the peopl __PUNCT__
we ar a peopl who __PUNCT__ in the languag of our declar of independ __PUNCT__ hold certain truth to be self __PUNCT__ evid __PUNCT__ name __PUNCT__ that all men ar endow by their creator with certain unalien right __PUNCT__
it is our belief in the univers of these unalien right that lead us to our except role on the world stage __PUNCT__ that of a great champion of human digniti and human freedom __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
i wa born in __NUM__ a classic babi boomer __PUNCT__
i grew up in a world form by on domin threat to america __PUNCT__ the soviet union and commun __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ duck and cover __PUNCT__ drill we learn in school dure the cuban missil crisi result from a threat by a known __PUNCT__ identifi enemi __PUNCT__ with clear border and establish leader __PUNCT__
we need spy plane to find the hidden missil in cuba but we didn't need them to find nikita khrushchev __PUNCT__
presid reagan could negoti with soviet premier mikhail gorbachev and sign treati for which each side could be held account __PUNCT__
and when we caught the soviet cheat __PUNCT__ we could bring the world attent to their transgress __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ our world is far more chaotic __PUNCT__
we still face grave threat __PUNCT__ but thei come not from on countri __PUNCT__ or on group __PUNCT__ or on ideolog __PUNCT__
the world is unfortun not so defin __PUNCT__
what america and our alli ar face is a seri of threaten forc __PUNCT__ on that overlap and reinforc each other __PUNCT__
to defend america __PUNCT__ and to secur a peac and prosper world __PUNCT__ we need to clearli understand these emerg threat __PUNCT__ grasp their complex __PUNCT__ and formul a strategi that deal with them befor thei explod into conflict __PUNCT__
it is far too easi for a presid to jump from crisi to crisi __PUNCT__ deal with on hot spot after anoth __PUNCT__
but to do so is to be shape by event rather than to shape event __PUNCT__
to avoid thi paralyz seduct of action rather than progress __PUNCT__ a presid must have a broad vision of the world coupl with clariti of purpos __PUNCT__
when i look around the world __PUNCT__ i see a hand of major forc that vie with america and free nation __PUNCT__ to shape the world in an imag of their choos __PUNCT__
these ar not exclus militari threat __PUNCT__
rather __PUNCT__ thei ar determin __PUNCT__ power forc that mai threaten freedom __PUNCT__ prosper __PUNCT__ and america nation interest __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ islam fundament with which we have been at war sinc sept __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ second __PUNCT__ the struggl in the greater middl east between those who yearn for freedom __PUNCT__ and those who seek to crush it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the danger and destabil rippl effect of fail and fail state __PUNCT__ from which terrorist mai find safe haven __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the anti __PUNCT__ american vision of regim in iran __PUNCT__ north korea __PUNCT__ venezuela __PUNCT__ and cuba __PUNCT__ two of which ar seek nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and these forc includ rise nation with hidden and emerg aspir __PUNCT__ like china __PUNCT__ determin to be a world superpow __PUNCT__ and a resurg russia __PUNCT__ led by a man who believ the soviet union wa great __PUNCT__ not evil __PUNCT__
there is no on approach to these challeng __PUNCT__
there is no wall that the next presid can demand to be torn down __PUNCT__
but there is on unifi thread that connect each of these possibl threat __PUNCT__ when america is strong __PUNCT__ the world is safer __PUNCT__
ronald reagan call it __PUNCT__ peac through strength __PUNCT__ and he wa never more right than todai __PUNCT__
it is onli american power __PUNCT__ conceiv in the broadest term __PUNCT__ that can provid the foundat of an intern system that ensur the secur and prosper of the unit state and our friend and alli around the world __PUNCT__
american strength rise from a strong economi __PUNCT__ a strong defens __PUNCT__ and the endur strength of our valu __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ under thi presid __PUNCT__ all three of those element have been weaken __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ on dai on __PUNCT__ i will focu on rebuild america economi __PUNCT__
i will revers presid obama massiv defens cut __PUNCT__
time and again __PUNCT__ we have seen that attempt to balanc the budget by weaken our militari onli lead to a far higher price __PUNCT__ not onli in treasur __PUNCT__ but in blood __PUNCT__
my strategi of american strength is guid by a set of core principl __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ american foreign polici must be prosecut with clariti and resolv __PUNCT__
our friend and alli must have no doubt about where we stand __PUNCT__
and neither should our rival __PUNCT__
if the world know we ar resolut __PUNCT__ our alli will be comfort and those who wish us harm will be far less tempt to test that resolv __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ america must promot open market __PUNCT__ repres govern __PUNCT__ and respect for human right __PUNCT__
the path from authoritarian to freedom and repres govern is not alwai a straight line or an easi evolut __PUNCT__ but histori teach us that nation that share our valu __PUNCT__ will be reliabl partner and stand with us in pursuit of common secur and share prosper __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ the unit state will appli the full spectrum of hard and soft power to influenc event befor thei erupt into conflict __PUNCT__
resort to forc is alwai the least desir and costliest option __PUNCT__
we must therefor emploi all the tool of statecraft to shape the outcom of threaten situat befor thei demand militari action __PUNCT__
the unit state should alwai retain militari supremaci to deter would __PUNCT__ be aggressor and to defend our alli and ourselv __PUNCT__
if america is the undisput leader of the world __PUNCT__ it reduc our need to polic a more chaotic world __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ the unit state will exercis leadership in multilater organ and allianc __PUNCT__
american leadership lend credibl and breed faith in the ultim success of ani action __PUNCT__ and attract full particip from other nation __PUNCT__
american leadership will also focu multilater institut like the unit nation on achiev the substant goal of democraci and human right enshrin in their charter __PUNCT__
too often __PUNCT__ these bodi prize the act of negoti over the outcom to be reach __PUNCT__
and shamefulli __PUNCT__ thei can becom forum for the tantrum of tyrant and the air of the world most ancient of prejudic __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ semit __PUNCT__
the unit state must fight to return these bodi to their proper role __PUNCT__
but know thi __PUNCT__ while america should work with other nation __PUNCT__ we alwai reserv the right to act alon to protect our vital nation interest __PUNCT__
in my first __NUM__ dai in offic __PUNCT__ i will take a seri of measur to put these principl into action __PUNCT__ and place america __PUNCT__ and the world __PUNCT__ on safer foot __PUNCT__
among these action will be to restor america nation defens __PUNCT__
i will revers the hollow of our navi and announc an initi to increas the shipbuild rate from __NUM__ per year to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i will begin revers obama __PUNCT__ era cut to nation missil defens and priorit the full deploy of a multilay nation ballist missil defens system __PUNCT__
i will order the formul of a nation cybersecur strategi __PUNCT__ to deter and defend against the grow threat of militar cyber __PUNCT__ attack __PUNCT__ cyber __PUNCT__ terror __PUNCT__ and cyber __PUNCT__ espionag __PUNCT__
i will enhanc our deterr against the iranian regim by order the regular presenc of aircraft carrier task forc __PUNCT__ on in the eastern mediterranean and on in the persian gulf region __PUNCT__
i will begin discuss with israel to increas the level of our militari assist and coordin __PUNCT__
and i will again reiter that iran obtain a nuclear weapon is unaccept __PUNCT__
i will begin organ all of our diplomat and assist effort in the greater middl east under on offici with the author and account necessari to train all our soft power resourc on ensur that the arab spring doe not fade into a long winter __PUNCT__
i will launch a campaign to advanc econom opportun in latin america __PUNCT__ and contrast the benefit of democraci __PUNCT__ free trade __PUNCT__ and free enterpris against the materi and moral bankruptci of the venezuelan and cuban model __PUNCT__
i will order a full review of our transit to the afghan militari to secur that nation sovereignti from the tyranni of the taliban __PUNCT__
i will speak with our gener in the field __PUNCT__ and receiv the best recommend of our militari command __PUNCT__
the forc level necessari to secur our gain and complet our mission successfulli is a decis i will make free from polit __PUNCT__
and i will bolster and repair our allianc __PUNCT__
our friend should never fear that we will not stand by them in an hour of need __PUNCT__
i will reaffirm as a vital nation interest israel exist as a jewish state __PUNCT__
i will count as dear our special relationship with the unit kingdom __PUNCT__
and i will begin talk with mexico __PUNCT__ to strengthen our cooper on our share problem of drug and secur __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
thi is america moment __PUNCT__
we should embrac the challeng __PUNCT__ not shrink from it __PUNCT__ not crawl into an isolationist shell __PUNCT__ not wave the white flag of surrend __PUNCT__ nor give in to those who assert america time ha pass __PUNCT__
that is utter nonsens __PUNCT__
an eloqu justifi surrend of world leadership is still surrend __PUNCT__
i will not surrend america role in the world __PUNCT__
thi is veri simpl __PUNCT__ if you do not want america to be the strongest nation on earth __PUNCT__ i am not your presid __PUNCT__
you have that presid todai __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ centuri can and must be an american centuri __PUNCT__
it began with terror __PUNCT__ war __PUNCT__ and econom calam __PUNCT__
it is our duti to steer it onto the path of freedom __PUNCT__ peac __PUNCT__ and prosper __PUNCT__
my hope is that our grandchildren will rememb us in the same wai that we rememb the past gener of american who overcam advers __PUNCT__ the gener that fought in world war __PUNCT__ that came through the great depress __PUNCT__ and that gain victori in the cold war __PUNCT__
let futur gener look back on us and sai __PUNCT__ thei rose to the occas __PUNCT__ thei embrac their duti __PUNCT__ and thei led our nation to safeti and to great __PUNCT__
the greatest gener is pass __PUNCT__
but as their light fade __PUNCT__ we must seiz the torch thei carri so gallantli at such sacrific __PUNCT__
it is an etern torch of decenc __PUNCT__ freedom and hope __PUNCT__
it is not america torch alon __PUNCT__
but it is america duti __PUNCT__ and honor __PUNCT__ to hold it high enough that all the world can see it light __PUNCT__
believ in america __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and god bless the unit state of america __PUNCT__
