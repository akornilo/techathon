thank you __PUNCT__ wisconsin __PUNCT__ and maryland __PUNCT__ and washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
we have won a great victori tonight in our campaign to restor the promis of america __PUNCT__
you won't find american with bigger heart than those here in our heartland __PUNCT__
but as i travel across thi beauti state __PUNCT__ i visit with far too mani whose heart ar fill with anxieti about the futur __PUNCT__
so mani good and decent peopl seem to be run harder just to stai in place and __PUNCT__ for mani __PUNCT__ no matter how hard thei run __PUNCT__ everi dai put them just a littl bit further behind __PUNCT__
it that wai across so much of america __PUNCT__
under thi presid watch __PUNCT__ more american have lost their job than dure ani other period sinc the depress __PUNCT__
million have lost their home __PUNCT__ and a record number of american ar live in poverti __PUNCT__
and the most vulner have been hurt the most __PUNCT__ over __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of singl mom ar struggl in poverti __PUNCT__
new busi startup ar at the lowest level in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ and our nation debt is at a record high __PUNCT__
and when you drive home tonight and stop at a ga station __PUNCT__ just take a look at the price and ask yourself __PUNCT__ four more year __PUNCT__
and that why it is import to understand on astonish fact about thi elect __PUNCT__ presid obama think he do a good job __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i not kid __PUNCT__
he actual think he do a great job __PUNCT__
an histor great job __PUNCT__
accord to the presid __PUNCT__ onli lincoln __PUNCT__ fdr and lyndon johnson have accomplish more __PUNCT__
and no __PUNCT__ he didn't sai that on saturdai night live __PUNCT__
it enough to make you think that year of fly around on air forc on __PUNCT__ surround by an ador staff of true believ tell you what a great job you ar do __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ that might be enough to make you a littl out of touch __PUNCT__
thi campaign will deal with mani complic issu but there is a basic choic befor us __PUNCT__
the presid ha pledg to __PUNCT__ transform america __PUNCT__ and he ha spent the last four year lai the foundat for a new govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__
i will spend the next four year rebuild the foundat of our opportun societi __PUNCT__ led by free peopl and free enterpris __PUNCT__
our differ vision for america ar the product of our valu and our life experi __PUNCT__
barack obama onc said that hi work as a commun organ motiv him to help __PUNCT__ commun that had been ravag by plant close __PUNCT__ hi desir to help other could not be more admir but it clear that he saw free enterpris as the villain and not the solut __PUNCT__
he never seem to grasp the basic point that a plant close when a busi lose monei __PUNCT__
so todai when the presid attack busi and when hi polici make it more difficult for busi to grow and prosper __PUNCT__ he is also attack the veri commun he want to help __PUNCT__
that how it work in america __PUNCT__
or at least that how it work when america is work __PUNCT__
but under barack obama __PUNCT__ america hasn't been work __PUNCT__
the iron tragedi is that the commun organ who want to help those hurt by a plant close becam the presid on whose watch more job have been lost than ani time sinc the great depress __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ the govern must do more becaus the economi is doom to do less __PUNCT__
when you attack busi and vilifi success __PUNCT__ you will have less busi and less success __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the debat becom about how much to extend unemploy insur becaus you have guarante there will be million more unemploi __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ tax increas becom not onli a necess __PUNCT__ but also a desir tool for social justic __PUNCT__
in that world of shrink mean __PUNCT__ there a finit amount of monei __PUNCT__ and as someon onc famous said __PUNCT__ you need tax to spread the wealth around __PUNCT__
in barack obama govern __PUNCT__ center societi __PUNCT__ govern spend will alwai increas becaus __PUNCT__ there no reason to stop it __PUNCT__
there alwai someon who is entitl to someth more __PUNCT__ and who will vote for anyon who will give them someth more __PUNCT__
we know where that transform lead __PUNCT__
there ar other nation that have chosen that path __PUNCT__
it lead to chronic high unemploy __PUNCT__ crush debt __PUNCT__ and stagnant wage __PUNCT__
sound familiar __PUNCT__
i don't want to transform america __PUNCT__ i want to restor the valu of econom freedom and opportun and limit govern that have made thi nation the leader it is __PUNCT__
it is opportun that ha alwai driven america and defin us as american __PUNCT__
i not naïv enough to believ that free enterpris is the solut to all of our problem __PUNCT__ nor am i naïv enough to doubt that it is on of the greatest forc of good thi world ha ever known __PUNCT__
free enterpris ha done more to lift peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__ to help build a strong middl class __PUNCT__ to help educ our kid __PUNCT__ and to make our live better __PUNCT__ than all of the govern program put togeth __PUNCT__
if we becom on of those societi that attack success __PUNCT__ on outcom is certain __PUNCT__ there will be a lot less success __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
the promis of america ha alwai been that if you work hard __PUNCT__ and took some risk __PUNCT__ that there wa the opportun to build a better life for your famili and for the next gener __PUNCT__
thi mean that govern must be smaller and have strict limit place on it power __PUNCT__
obamacar violat both principl __PUNCT__
i will repeal it __PUNCT__
tax should be as low as possibl __PUNCT__ in line with those of compet nation __PUNCT__ and design to foster innov and growth __PUNCT__
that why i will cut margin tax rate across the board __PUNCT__
regul ar necessari __PUNCT__ but thei must be continu updat __PUNCT__ streamlin __PUNCT__ and modern __PUNCT__
regul should see part of their job as protect econom freedom __PUNCT__ promot enterpris __PUNCT__ and foster job creation __PUNCT__
worker should have the right to form union __PUNCT__ but union should not be forc upon them __PUNCT__
and union should not have the power to take monei out of their member __PUNCT__ paycheck to bui the support of politician favor by the union boss __PUNCT__
out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch liber like barack obama sai thei want a strong economi __PUNCT__ but thei realli don't like busi veri much __PUNCT__
but the economi is simpli the product of all the nation busi ad togeth __PUNCT__
so it like sai you love omelet but don't like egg __PUNCT__
to build a strong economi that provid good job and rise wage and that reduc poverti __PUNCT__ we need to build success busi of everi kind imagin __PUNCT__
and presid obama ha been attack success busi of everi kind imagin __PUNCT__
we have alwai been the countri where dreamer build dream and where on dream help launch anoth __PUNCT__
and if those dreamer ar reward with prosper __PUNCT__ we view that as a reason other would be encourag to dream big as well __PUNCT__
these last few year have been difficult __PUNCT__ made wors by mistak and failur of leadership __PUNCT__
but if the hill befor us is a littl steeper we have alwai been a nation of big stepper __PUNCT__
in thi last year __PUNCT__ i have been all over thi countri __PUNCT__ from student union cafeteria to kitchen tabl __PUNCT__ from factori break room to boardroom __PUNCT__ and i heard frustrat and anger but rare hopeless __PUNCT__
mani american have given up on thi presid but thei haven't ever thought about give up __PUNCT__
not on themselv __PUNCT__
not on each other __PUNCT__
and not on america __PUNCT__
we have a sacr duti to restor the promis of america __PUNCT__
and we will do it __PUNCT__
we will do it becaus we believ in america __PUNCT__

join me in the next step toward that destin of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ when across america we can give a sigh of relief and know that the promis of america ha been kept __PUNCT__
the dreamer can dream a littl bigger __PUNCT__ the help want sign can be dust off __PUNCT__ and we can start again __PUNCT__
and thi time we get it right __PUNCT__
we stop the dai of apolog for success at home and never again apolog for america abroad __PUNCT__
togeth we build the greatest america we have ever known __PUNCT__ where prosper is grown and share __PUNCT__ not limit and divid __PUNCT__ an america that guarante that our is the door that innov and great alwai knock on first __PUNCT__
there wa a time __PUNCT__ not so long ago __PUNCT__ when each of us could walk a littl taller and stand a littl straighter becaus we had a gift that no on els in the world share __PUNCT__
we were american __PUNCT__
that meant someth differ to each of us __PUNCT__ but it meant someth special to all of us __PUNCT__
