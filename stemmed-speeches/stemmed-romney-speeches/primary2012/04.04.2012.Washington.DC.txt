but i do know thi __PUNCT__ you will continu to find wai to provid the american peopl with reliabl inform that is vital to our live and to our nation __PUNCT__
and i am confid that the press will remain free __PUNCT__
but further __PUNCT__ i salut thi organ and your variou institut in your effort to make it not onli free __PUNCT__ but also respons __PUNCT__ accur __PUNCT__ relev __PUNCT__ and integr to the function of our democraci __PUNCT__
given the number and scale of our nation current challeng __PUNCT__ the __DATE__ elect will have particular consequ __PUNCT__
it will be a defin event __PUNCT__
presid obama and i have veri differ vision for america __PUNCT__ both of what it mean to be an american todai and what it will mean in the futur __PUNCT__
the voter will expect each of us to put our respect view on the tabl __PUNCT__
we will each make our case __PUNCT__ buttress by our experi __PUNCT__
the voter will hear the debat __PUNCT__ be buffet by advertis __PUNCT__ and be inform by your coverag __PUNCT__
and hopefulli after all thi __PUNCT__ thei will have an accur understand of the differ direct we would take and the differ choic we would make __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ for that to happen __PUNCT__ the candid must be candid about their view and plan __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ in that regard __PUNCT__ presid obama comment to presid medvedev ar deepli troubl __PUNCT__
that incid call hi candor into seriou question __PUNCT__
he doe not want to share hi real plan befor the elect __PUNCT__ either with the public or with the press __PUNCT__
by flexibl __PUNCT__ he mean that __PUNCT__ what the american public doesn't know won't hurt him __PUNCT__ he is intent on hide __PUNCT__
you and i will have to do the seek __PUNCT__
barack obama exchang with the russian presid rais all kind of seriou question __PUNCT__ what exactli doe presid obama intend to do differ onc he is no longer account to the voter __PUNCT__ why doe __PUNCT__ flexibl __PUNCT__ with foreign leader requir less account to the american peopl __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ on what other issu will he state hi true posit onli after the elect is over __PUNCT__
but instead of answer those vital question __PUNCT__ presid obama came here yesterdai and rail against argument no on is make __PUNCT__ and critic polici no on is propos __PUNCT__
it on of hi favorit strategi __PUNCT__ set up straw men to distract from hi record __PUNCT__
and while i understand why the presid doesn't want to run on hi record __PUNCT__ he can't run from hi record either __PUNCT__
as i have said mani time befor __PUNCT__ the presid did not caus the econom crisi __PUNCT__ but he made it wors __PUNCT__
he delai the recoveri __PUNCT__ and made it anem __PUNCT__
when he took offic __PUNCT__ million of american look to him to turn around the economi and lead us back to full employ __PUNCT__
he fail these american __PUNCT__
the first three rule of ani turnaround ar focu __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__ and focu __PUNCT__
but instead of focus hi attent on the economi __PUNCT__ he deleg the stimulu to nanci pelosi and harri reid __PUNCT__
the __MONEY__ billion stimulu includ a grab bag of pet project that had languish in congress for good reason __PUNCT__ for year __PUNCT__
it wa less a job plan and more the mother of all earmark __PUNCT__
the administr pledg that it would keep unemploy below __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it ha been abov __NUM__ __PUNCT__ everi month sinc __PUNCT__
the presid attent wa elsewher __PUNCT__ like a govern takeov of healthcar and apolog for america abroad __PUNCT__
he hand out ten of billion of dollar to green energi compani __PUNCT__ includ hi friend and campaign contributor at compani like solyndra that ar now bankrupt __PUNCT__
presid obama answer to our econom crisi wa more spend __PUNCT__ more debt __PUNCT__ and more govern __PUNCT__
by the end of hi term in offic __PUNCT__ he will have ad nearli as much public debt as all the prior presid combin __PUNCT__
no presid had ever run a trillion dollar deficit __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__ new normal __PUNCT__ the presid would have us embrac is trillion dollar deficit and eight percent unemploy __PUNCT__
through it all __PUNCT__ presid obama ha fail to even pass a budget __PUNCT__
in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ he put forward a propos that includ the largest tax increas in histori __PUNCT__ and still left our nation debt spiral out of control __PUNCT__
the hous reject it unanim __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ no fiscal challeng is greater than the on we face with entitl __PUNCT__
as the presid himself acknowledg three year ago __PUNCT__ thi is not a problem that we can kick down the road ani further __PUNCT__
i be will to consid the presid plan __PUNCT__ but he doesn't have on __PUNCT__
that right __PUNCT__ in over three year __PUNCT__ he ha fail to enact or even propos a seriou plan to solv our entitl crisi __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he ha taken a seri of step that end medicar as we know it __PUNCT__
he is the onli presid to ever cut __MONEY__ billion from medicar __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ as a result __PUNCT__ more than half of doctor sai thei will cut back on treat senior __PUNCT__
he is destroi the medicar advantag program __PUNCT__ elimin the coverag that million of senior depend on and reduc choic by two __PUNCT__ third __PUNCT__
to control medicar cost __PUNCT__ he ha creat an unelect __PUNCT__ unaccount panel with the power to prevent medicar from provid certain treatment __PUNCT__
the result will be fewer treatment and servic avail to patient in need __PUNCT__ and nowher els to turn __PUNCT__
a coupl of month ago __PUNCT__ we saw a fascin exchang on capitol hill that epitom not onli thi administr inact on entitl __PUNCT__ but also it appal lack of leadership __PUNCT__
the presid treasuri secretari __PUNCT__ timothi geithner __PUNCT__ wa testifi befor congress __PUNCT__
and congressman paul ryan __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ unlik thi presid __PUNCT__ ha had the courag to offer seriou solut to the problem we face __PUNCT__ wa press geithner on the administr failur to lead on entitl reform __PUNCT__
geithner respons wa thi __PUNCT__ we ar not come befor you todai to sai we have a definit solut to that long term problem __PUNCT__
what we do know is we don't like your __PUNCT__
take a moment and think about that __PUNCT__ we don't have a solut __PUNCT__
all we know is we don't like your __PUNCT__
it almost make on long for the dai when the presid simpli led from behind __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ in the middl of the weakest econom recoveri sinc the great depress __PUNCT__ the presid purport to have experienc a seri of elect __PUNCT__ year convers __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ he ha repeatedli call for tax increas on busi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as candid obama __PUNCT__ he decid that a lower corpor tax rate would be better __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ he ad regul at a stagger rate __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as candid obama __PUNCT__ he sai he want to find wai to reduc them __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ he delai the develop of our oil and coal and natur ga __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as candid obama __PUNCT__ he sai he favor an energi polici that adopt an all __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ abov approach __PUNCT__
nanci pelosi famous said that we would have to pass obamacar to find out what wa in it __PUNCT__
presid obama ha turn that advic into a campaign strategi __PUNCT__ he want us to re __PUNCT__ elect him so we can find out what he will actual do __PUNCT__
with all the challeng the nation face __PUNCT__ thi is not the time for presid obama hide and seek campaign __PUNCT__
presid obama ha said that he want to transform america __PUNCT__
i don't want to transform america __PUNCT__ i want to restor the valu of econom freedom __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ and small govern that have made thi nation the leader it is __PUNCT__
it is opportun that ha alwai driven america and defin us as american __PUNCT__
my grandfath wa in the construct busi and he never realli made it himself __PUNCT__
but he convinc my dad that he could accomplish anyth he set hi mind to __PUNCT__
my dad didn't have the chanc to finish colleg and he apprent as a lath and plaster carpent __PUNCT__
base on that excel train __PUNCT__ he went on to turn around a great car compani and later becam governor of michigan __PUNCT__
my father made the most of opportun that came befor him __PUNCT__ and by the time i came along __PUNCT__ i wa the fourth of four brother and sister __PUNCT__ i had the chanc to get the educ my dad couldn't __PUNCT__
i love car and wa tempt to stai in michigan and go into the car busi but i knew i would alwai wonder if ani success i had wa due to my dad __PUNCT__
so when i got out of busi school __PUNCT__ i stai in massachusett and got a job with the best compani that would hire me __PUNCT__
more importantli __PUNCT__ i wa marri and on the wai to have five son __PUNCT__
over the next __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ my busi career had mani up and down __PUNCT__ great success __PUNCT__ definit failur __PUNCT__ but each step of the wai i learn more about the power of our great free enterpris system __PUNCT__
i not naïv enough to believ that free enterpris is the solut to all of our problem __PUNCT__ nor am i naïv enough to doubt that it is on of the greatest forc of good thi world ha ever known __PUNCT__
free enterpris ha done more to lift peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__ to help build a strong middl class __PUNCT__ to help educ our kid __PUNCT__ to make our live better __PUNCT__ than all of the govern program put togeth __PUNCT__
if we becom on of those societi that attack success __PUNCT__ on outcom is certain __PUNCT__ there will be a lot less success __PUNCT__
that not who we ar __PUNCT__
the promis of america ha alwai been that if you work hard __PUNCT__ and took some risk __PUNCT__ that there wa the opportun to build a better life for your famili and for the next gener __PUNCT__
i offer a clear choic and a differ path __PUNCT__

we eras a __MONEY__ billion budget shortfal and left offic with a __MONEY__ billion raini dai fund __PUNCT__
i cast over __NUM__ veto and cut entir program __PUNCT__
if there wa a program __PUNCT__ an agenc __PUNCT__ or a depart that need cut __PUNCT__ we cut it __PUNCT__
on comment said that i didn't just go after the sacr cow __PUNCT__ i went after the whole herd __PUNCT__
and i can't wait to get my hand on washington __PUNCT__
unlik presid obama __PUNCT__ you don't have to wait until after the elect to find out what i believ in __PUNCT__ or what my plan ar __PUNCT__
i have a pro __PUNCT__ growth agenda that will get our economi back on track __PUNCT__ and get american back to work __PUNCT__
thi administr think our economi is struggl becaus the stimulu wa too small __PUNCT__
the truth is we struggl becaus our govern is too big __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will get the govern out of the wai and unleash the power of american enterpris and innov __PUNCT__
seven month ago __PUNCT__ i present a detail plan for job and econom growth __PUNCT__ includ __NUM__ differ propos that would help strengthen the economi __PUNCT__
i understand some peopl ar amus that i have so mani idea __PUNCT__
but i think the american peopl will prefer it to presid obama grand total of zero __PUNCT__
i will cut margin tax rate across the board for individu and corpor __PUNCT__ and limit deduct and exclus __PUNCT__
i will repeal burdensom regul __PUNCT__ and prevent the bureaucraci from write new on __PUNCT__
i will unleash our domest energi resourc so that we can final get the energi we need at a price we can afford __PUNCT__
instead of pick winner and loser with taxpay dollar __PUNCT__ i will make sure that everi entrepreneur get a fair shot and that everi busi plai by the same rule __PUNCT__
i will creat an environ where our busi and worker can compet and win __PUNCT__
i will welcom the best and the brightest to our shore __PUNCT__ and ensur that we have labor and train polici that help american worker to be more competit __PUNCT__
instead of grow the feder govern __PUNCT__ i will shrink it __PUNCT__
i will repeal obamacar __PUNCT__ and cut program that we cannot afford __PUNCT__
i will send to the state those program thei can implement with better result at lower cost __PUNCT__
i have alreadi propos a plan that will save and strengthen medicar and social secur for futur gener __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ unlik presid obama __PUNCT__ i have the courag to stand behind my plan and the leadership to enact it __PUNCT__
my plan preserv these program for those at or near retir and strengthen them for futur gener __PUNCT__ without tax increas __PUNCT__
i will gradual rais the retir ag for social secur __PUNCT__ and reduc the rate of benefit growth for tomorrow higher incom senior __PUNCT__
i will introduc market competit and consum choic to medicar __PUNCT__ while also preserv tradit medicar coverag as an option __PUNCT__ so that futur senior can get higher qualiti care at lower cost __PUNCT__
thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we will face a defin decis __PUNCT__
our choic will not be on of parti or person __PUNCT__
thi elect will be about principl __PUNCT__
freedom and opportun will be on the ballot __PUNCT__
i am offer a real choic and a new begin __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i have the experi and the vision to get us out of thi mess __PUNCT__
we know what barack obama vision of america is __PUNCT__ we all live it the last three year __PUNCT__
mine is veri differ __PUNCT__
i see an america where we know the prospect for our children will be better than our own __PUNCT__ where the pursuit of success unit us __PUNCT__ not divid us __PUNCT__ where the valu we pass on to our children ar greater than the debt we leav them __PUNCT__ where poverti is defeat by opportun __PUNCT__ not enabl by a govern check __PUNCT__
i see an america that is humbl but never humbl __PUNCT__ that lead but is never lead __PUNCT__
in thi campaign __PUNCT__ i will lead us toward that america __PUNCT__
we wage thi campaign as republican or democrat __PUNCT__ but we share a destini as american __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we will ensur that america greatest dai ar yet ahead __PUNCT__
thank you and god bless __PUNCT__
