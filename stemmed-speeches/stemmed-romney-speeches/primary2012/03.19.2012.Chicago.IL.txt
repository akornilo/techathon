it told the sackett thei weren't allow to go to court __PUNCT__
an unelect govern bureaucrat rob them of their freedom __PUNCT__
thei were given no recours __PUNCT__ no remedi __PUNCT__

under presid obama __PUNCT__ those same bureaucrat ar insinu themselv into everi corner of the economi __PUNCT__
thei prevent drill rig from go to work in the gulf __PUNCT__
thei keep coal from be mine __PUNCT__
thei imped the reliabl suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__

will roger famous said __PUNCT__ thi countri ha come to feel the same when congress is in session as we do when the babi get hold of a hammer __PUNCT__
it just a question of how much damag he can do with it befor you can take it awai from him __PUNCT__
will roger wa concern about the damag congress could do __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ our freedom is never safe __PUNCT__ becaus unelect __PUNCT__ unaccount regul ar alwai on the prowl __PUNCT__
and under presid obama __PUNCT__ thei ar multipli like proverbi rabbit __PUNCT__

for everi regul __PUNCT__ there ar unintend consequ __PUNCT__ underestim cost __PUNCT__ and unwant influenc from special interest __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the bureaucrat impuls is to make more rule __PUNCT__ never to reduc them __PUNCT__
all those regul erod our freedom and stifl prosper __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the obama assault on econom freedom is not limit to action against individu and enterpris __PUNCT__ it extend to it intrus upon the free marketplac itself __PUNCT__
when govern rather than the market routin select the winner and loser __PUNCT__ enterpris cannot predict their prospect __PUNCT__ and free enterpris is replac with croni capit __PUNCT__
solyndra __PUNCT__ ener1 __PUNCT__ fisker __PUNCT__ and tesla ar exampl __PUNCT__
when the govern invest __MONEY__ million in solyndra __PUNCT__ you can imagin that score of other solar energi entrepreneur and enterpris either lost their investor or fail to find ani __PUNCT__
when the nlrb tri to shut down boe plant in south carolina __PUNCT__ it sent a signal dissuad busi of all kind from make similar invest in right to work state __PUNCT__ limit their freedom __PUNCT__
when gener motor share were direct to the uaw __PUNCT__ polit payback replac the rule of law __PUNCT__ and the rule of law is fundament to econom freedom __PUNCT__
when the heavi hand of govern replac the invis hand of the market __PUNCT__ econom freedom is the inevit victim __PUNCT__
for centuri __PUNCT__ the american dream ha meant the opportun to build someth new __PUNCT__
some of america greatest success stori ar of peopl who start out with noth but a good idea and a corner in their garag __PUNCT__
too often todai __PUNCT__ american look at what it take to start a busi and thei don't see promis and opportun __PUNCT__
thei see govern stand in their wai __PUNCT__
the real cost isn't just the tax paid and monei spent compli with the rule __PUNCT__
it the busi that ar never start __PUNCT__ the idea that ar never pursu __PUNCT__ the dream that ar defer __PUNCT__
we onc built the interst highwai system and the hoover dam __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we can't even build a pipelin __PUNCT__
we onc led the world in manufactur __PUNCT__ export __PUNCT__ and infrastructur invest __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we lead the world in lawsuit __PUNCT__
labor union onc serv as a symbol of worker right __PUNCT__ fair treatment __PUNCT__ and a grow middl class __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ thei too often repres the worst of special interest and croni capit __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__ after spend three year attack busi __PUNCT__ presid obama hope to eras hi record with a speech __PUNCT__
in a recent address __PUNCT__ he said that __PUNCT__ we ar inventor __PUNCT__
we ar builder __PUNCT__
we ar maker of thing __PUNCT__
we ar thoma edison __PUNCT__
we ar the wright brother __PUNCT__
we ar bill gate __PUNCT__
we ar steve job __PUNCT__
the realiti is that __PUNCT__ under presid obama administr __PUNCT__ these pioneer would have found it much more difficult __PUNCT__ if not imposs __PUNCT__ to innov __PUNCT__ invent __PUNCT__ and creat __PUNCT__
under dodd __PUNCT__ frank __PUNCT__ thei would have struggl to get loan from their commun bank __PUNCT__
a regul would have shut down the wright brother for their __PUNCT__ dust pollut __PUNCT__
and the govern would have ban thoma edison light bulb __PUNCT__
oh yeah __PUNCT__ obama regul actual did just that __PUNCT__
everi great innov __PUNCT__ everi world __PUNCT__ chang busi breakthrough begin with a dream __PUNCT__
and noth is more fragil than a dream __PUNCT__
it is essenti to the geniu of america that we have develop a cultur that nurtur these dream and dreamer __PUNCT__ that honor them and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ reward them __PUNCT__
there ha alwai been someth uniqu brilliant about america __PUNCT__
i don't believ thi presid understand thi fundament secret of america __PUNCT__
and dai by dai __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ kill regul by regul __PUNCT__ bureaucrat by bureaucrat __PUNCT__ he is crush the dream and the dreamer __PUNCT__
if we continu along thi path __PUNCT__ our live will be rule by bureaucrat and board __PUNCT__ commiss and czar __PUNCT__
that path erod freedom __PUNCT__
it deaden the entrepreneuri spirit __PUNCT__
freedom is becom the victim of unbound govern appetit __PUNCT__ and so is econom growth __PUNCT__ job growth __PUNCT__ and wage growth __PUNCT__
as govern take more and more __PUNCT__ there is less and less incent to take risk __PUNCT__ to invest __PUNCT__ to innov __PUNCT__ and to hire __PUNCT__
the proof is in thi weak recoveri __PUNCT__
thi administr think our economi is struggl becaus the stimulu wa too small __PUNCT__
the truth is we struggl becaus our govern is too big __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i have the experi and the vision to get us out of thi mess __PUNCT__
i am offer a real choic and a new begin __PUNCT__
and i have a conserv econom plan that will deliv more job __PUNCT__ less debt __PUNCT__ and smaller govern __PUNCT__
my agenda take america in the right direct __PUNCT__
it preserv freedom __PUNCT__
it encourag risk and innov __PUNCT__
it foster competit __PUNCT__
it allow american to pursu happi as thei choos __PUNCT__ and will lead to greater opportun __PUNCT__
instead of expand the govern __PUNCT__ i will shrink it __PUNCT__
instead of rais tax __PUNCT__ i will cut them __PUNCT__
instead of ad more regul __PUNCT__ i will reduc them with an overrid concern __PUNCT__ do thei help or do thei hurt job __PUNCT__
that just the begin __PUNCT__
there is still more we can do __PUNCT__
befor we can creat endur prosper __PUNCT__ we must restor our econom freedom __PUNCT__
to build a strong america __PUNCT__ we must empow american to pursu happi as thei choos __PUNCT__ not as govern direct __PUNCT__
we must restor the world most competit economi __PUNCT__ not relinquish it to croni and bureaucrat __PUNCT__
we must elect a presid who put hi faith in free peopl __PUNCT__ in free enterpris __PUNCT__ and in the found principl that made thi countri the greatest nation in histori __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ let restor america promis by renew our econom freedom __PUNCT__
let us affirm our convict that america is a land of opportun and usher in a new era of endur prosper and american leadership __PUNCT__
