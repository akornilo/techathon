these reform will grow our economi __PUNCT__ increas wage __PUNCT__ and creat job __PUNCT__
if we go to get our fiscal hous in order __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ we must also fix our nation balanc sheet __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we face __MONEY__ trillion in unfund promis in our entitl program __PUNCT__
we talk a lot about our __MONEY__ trillion of debt __PUNCT__
and we got to tackl that debt __PUNCT__
but it that __MONEY__ trillion in unfund promis that keep most of us up at night __PUNCT__
a few commonsens reform will ensur we make good on our promis to todai senior while save social secur and medicar for futur gener __PUNCT__
tax hike ar off the tabl __PUNCT__ and there will be no chang for those at or near retir __PUNCT__
but younger gener will enter a system strengthen for the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__

when it come to medicar __PUNCT__ tomorrow senior will have a choic among insur provid __PUNCT__ includ tradit medicar __PUNCT__
as with medicar part d todai __PUNCT__ the privat sector will compet to offer insur coverag at the lowest possibl price __PUNCT__
senior will then receiv govern support to ensur thei can afford that coverag __PUNCT__
and with medicar __PUNCT__ like with social secur __PUNCT__ lower __PUNCT__ incom senior will receiv the most gener benefit __PUNCT__
start in __NUM__ new retire will particip in thi new system __PUNCT__
we will gradual increas the medicar elig ag by on month each year __PUNCT__
in the long run __PUNCT__ the elig ag for both program will be index to longev so that thei increas onli as fast as life expect __PUNCT__
with these commonsens chang __PUNCT__ we will have fix our balanc sheet __PUNCT__
instead of __MONEY__ trillion in unfund commit hang over america futur __PUNCT__ we have a balanc sheet that is actual in balanc __PUNCT__
my administr will also make the hundr of billion of dollar in cut necessari to reduc spend to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of gdp by the end of my first term __PUNCT__
i will cap it there __PUNCT__
and then __PUNCT__ without sacrif our militari superior __PUNCT__ i will balanc the budget __PUNCT__
there ar three wai i get thi done __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i cut program __PUNCT__
i will look at everi govern program and ask thi question __PUNCT__ is thi so critic that it worth borrow monei from china to pai for it __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we start with the easiest cut of all __PUNCT__ obamacar __PUNCT__ a trillion __PUNCT__ dollar entitl we don't want and can't afford __PUNCT__
it bad medicin __PUNCT__ bad polici __PUNCT__ and when i presid __PUNCT__ the bad new of obamacar will be over __PUNCT__
we also cut thing like subsidi to amtrak and fund for plan parenthood __PUNCT__
we repeal the union giveawai call the davi __PUNCT__ bacon act to save taxpay over __MONEY__ billion per year __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we will return feder program to the state __PUNCT__
i will send medicaid back to the state and cap that program rate of growth __PUNCT__
and i will do the same for other program __PUNCT__ like food stamp __PUNCT__ hous subsidi __PUNCT__ and job train __PUNCT__
state ar better equip to perform all these function __PUNCT__
onc the economi is realli grow again __PUNCT__ i believ that we should return spend on these program to pre __PUNCT__ recess level __PUNCT__ cap their rate of growth __PUNCT__ and give the state flexibl and control __PUNCT__
taxpay would save monei __PUNCT__ and those in need would benefit from program that ar more effect __PUNCT__ effici __PUNCT__ and respons __PUNCT__
welfar reform show us how well a state __PUNCT__ led approach can work __PUNCT__
let extend that conserv __PUNCT__ small __PUNCT__ govern philosophi across the entir social safeti net __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ govern itself must be made more effici __PUNCT__
i will shrink the size of the feder workforc by __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and link the pai and benefit of feder employe to those of their peer in the privat sector __PUNCT__
public servant should not make more than the american who pai their salari __PUNCT__
thi is a plan to get america back on track __PUNCT__
and to get michigan on track we also need to see a strong and vibrant auto industri __PUNCT__
let learn from the lesson of the past __PUNCT__
in my view __PUNCT__ the industri got in troubl becaus the uaw ask for too much __PUNCT__ manag gave too much __PUNCT__ and the govern cafe standard hurt domest automak __PUNCT__
the result wa a cost __PUNCT__ penalti per vehicl of about __MONEY__
even the best design and engin could not overcom that kind of cost disadvantag __PUNCT__
as we look forward __PUNCT__ the uaw must not imperil the futur of the industri __PUNCT__
cafe standard must not be overli burdensom __PUNCT__
the compani must invest in new technolog and new market __PUNCT__
we should get govern out of gener motor so that it futur is determin by the demand of the marketplac __PUNCT__ not the prefer of bureaucrat __PUNCT__
and detroit should not just be the motor citi of america __PUNCT__
it must be the motor citi of the world __PUNCT__
my econom plan will strengthen america __PUNCT__ and strengthen michigan __PUNCT__
by make bold cut in spend and commonsens entitl reform __PUNCT__ we will make our govern simpler __PUNCT__ smaller __PUNCT__ and smarter __PUNCT__

these ar conserv __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ growth polici that will not onli jumpstart our economi __PUNCT__ but will stop the danger slide toward a societi that valu entitl over opportun __PUNCT__
we will restor the promis of america __PUNCT__
