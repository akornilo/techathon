you know __PUNCT__ todai we realli ar pois for victori in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
the __PUNCT__
the pundit __PUNCT__ the pundit and the pollster ar sai that we can win the elect __PUNCT__ but we have to tell the nation why we should win the elect __PUNCT__
it up to us to prove that we realli readi to step forward and lead thi countri __PUNCT__

that the easi part __PUNCT__
believ me __PUNCT__ __DATE__ will be the easiest dai our next presid is gonna face __PUNCT__
thi countri we love is in jeopardi __PUNCT__
and it more than just econom statist that we read that tell us that __PUNCT__ it the pain that so mani of us feel in our heart __PUNCT__
for three year we suffer through the failur not onli of a weak leader __PUNCT__ but of a bankrupt ideolog __PUNCT__
i convinc that if we do our job __PUNCT__ if we lead with convict and integr __PUNCT__ that histori will record the obama presid as the last gasp of liber great failur and a turn point for the conserv era to come __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ but it not enough for us just to show how thei fail __PUNCT__
we also have to prove how we will and deserv to lead __PUNCT__
and so i here to ask you todai to stand with me shoulder __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ shoulder as we go forward to fight for america __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as we step forward togeth __PUNCT__ now i think is a time to reaffirm what it mean to be conserv and why thi must be our greatest hour as conserv __PUNCT__
america like no other countri in the histori of the earth __PUNCT__
the veri heart of american conservat is the convict that the principl embodi in the constitut and the declar of independ ar uniqu power __PUNCT__ foundat and defin __PUNCT__
some see the hand of provid in the craft of these principl __PUNCT__
other ar more like to credit the brillianc of the founder themselv __PUNCT__
i think a lot of us __PUNCT__ like me __PUNCT__ see both at plai __PUNCT__
but conserv all agre that depart from these found principl would repres a departur from the great of america __PUNCT__ from our mission __PUNCT__ from our freedom __PUNCT__ from our prosper __PUNCT__ from our purpos __PUNCT__
i __PUNCT__ i know that thi presid will never get it __PUNCT__ but we conserv aren't just proud to cling to our gun and to our religion __PUNCT__
we ar also proud to cling to our constitut __PUNCT__
the wisdom of our found document is that thei see the nation prosper not as a product of govern __PUNCT__ but as the product of individu citizen __PUNCT__ each pursu happi __PUNCT__
the kei to the success of the american experi is thi __PUNCT__ america doesn't just exist for the peopl __PUNCT__ it ha been made except by the peopl __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ it thi brillianc __PUNCT__ a free peopl pursu their own dream __PUNCT__ achiev success in their own wai __PUNCT__ that what propel america and ha made us to be the most prosper nation and most power nation in the histori of the earth __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ there ar a lot of politician on both side of the aisl that have forgotten that __PUNCT__ if thei ever realli understood it at all __PUNCT__
thei fallen under the spell of washington __PUNCT__
politician __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ thei routin elect by promis that thei go to chang washington __PUNCT__
but when thei came here __PUNCT__ thei becam creatur of washington __PUNCT__
thei begin to see govern as the answer to everi challeng and the solut for everi problem __PUNCT__
at everi turn __PUNCT__ thei __PUNCT__ thei try to substitut the heavi hand of govern for free citizen and free enterpris oper in a free manner __PUNCT__
thei think govern know better and can do better than a free peopl exercis their free will __PUNCT__
and thi presid is the worst offend __PUNCT__
barack obama is the poster child for the arrog of govern __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ as i sai across thi countri __PUNCT__ thi elect realli is about a battl for the soul of america __PUNCT__
and it go to come down to a choic __PUNCT__ a choic between whether we want a nation to be of and by washington or a nation of and by a free peopl __PUNCT__
and we conserv believ in freedom and free peopl and free enterpris __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ as conserv __PUNCT__ we unit by a set of core convict __PUNCT__
not everyon ha taken the same path to get here __PUNCT__
there ar colleg student at thi confer who ar read burk and __PUNCT__
my guess is some of you got here by read burk and hayek __PUNCT__
when i wa your ag __PUNCT__ you could told me that thei were infield for the detroit tiger __PUNCT__

as some of you who work in think tank or you follow the write of some of the promin conserv writer current and in the past __PUNCT__ some of you have probabl work in govern or you labor on the front line of conserv caus __PUNCT__
i salut to all of you in achiev your vision of conservat __PUNCT__
my path to conservat came from my famili __PUNCT__ from my faith and from my life work __PUNCT__
i wa rais in a home that wa shape by and root in conserv valu __PUNCT__
my mother father __PUNCT__ my grandfath __PUNCT__ came to america from england __PUNCT__
as a teenag he wa alon in thi new countri __PUNCT__ but he risk it all for the chanc at religi liberti and for econom opportun __PUNCT__
you probabl also heard about my dad and how proud i am of him __PUNCT__
he as born to american parent who were live in mexico __PUNCT__ and then when he wa __NUM__ thei move back to the u. __PUNCT__
hi dad as a contractor __PUNCT__ but he went bust more than onc __PUNCT__
my dad grew up poor __PUNCT__ never had the chanc to finish hi colleg degre __PUNCT__
but he believ in the countri where the circumst of on birth were not __PUNCT__ ph __PUNCT__ a barrier to life achiev __PUNCT__
and so with hard work he becam the head of a car compani __PUNCT__

leadership as a chief execut isn't about get a bill out of confer or give a great speech __PUNCT__
it about set clear goal __PUNCT__ build a terrif team __PUNCT__ overcom constant advers __PUNCT__ and achiev result __PUNCT__
it about share credit when time ar good and about take respons when thei not __PUNCT__

to chang washington __PUNCT__ we go to have to chang the veri relationship between govern and the citizen __PUNCT__
and these ar moral choic that defin our nation and defin us for gener to come __PUNCT__
let me mention a few of them __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__ we borrow __NUM__ cent of everi dollar we spend __PUNCT__
that unconscion __PUNCT__
it unsustain __PUNCT__
it reckless __PUNCT__
it immor __PUNCT__
and it end under my presid __PUNCT__
i approach everi spend decis __PUNCT__ everi budget item with these question __PUNCT__ can we afford it __PUNCT__ and if not __PUNCT__ is it realli worth borrow monei from china to pai for it __PUNCT__

and as presid __PUNCT__ i won't just slow the growth rate of govern __PUNCT__
i will actual cut the spend of govern __PUNCT__
and i won't __PUNCT__

i gonna tie the compens and benefit of feder worker with worker in the privat sector __PUNCT__
the principl here is realli simpl __PUNCT__ and that is public servant should not get a better deal than the citizen that ar pai for __PUNCT__ em __PUNCT__
as import as it is __PUNCT__ cut spend and bureaucraci alon ar not gonna be enough __PUNCT__
in their current form __PUNCT__ we gonna have to recogn that social secur and medicar ar unsustain __PUNCT__ not for the current group of retire __PUNCT__ but for come gener __PUNCT__
and we can't afford to avoid these entitl challeng ani longer __PUNCT__
i the onli candid for presid who ha offer a sweep __PUNCT__ specif plan to save medicar and to reform social secur __PUNCT__

he will not be lectur to us on valu as a man whose ineptitud and failur ha creat so much unnecessari pain for our fellow american __PUNCT__
our will not be the easi cours __PUNCT__ but it will be the right cours __PUNCT__
and i confid that american ar learn __PUNCT__ yearn for a presid who will tell them the truth and do what need __PUNCT__ not just do what expedi __PUNCT__
