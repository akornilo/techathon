if we stai on the present cours __PUNCT__ we will face tomorrow what greec __PUNCT__ itali __PUNCT__ and spain face todai __PUNCT__
but there is no nation big enough to bail us out __PUNCT__
it took __NUM__ presid over __NUM__ year to accumul __MONEY__ trillion of nation debt __PUNCT__

i put my faith in peopl __PUNCT__

thi is not onli good for the economi __PUNCT__ it is a moral imper __PUNCT__
we cannot with moral conscienc borrow trillion of dollar that can onli be repaid by our children __PUNCT__
we cannot so weaken our econom foundat that we jeopard our abil to preserv freedom __PUNCT__
there ar some who argu that fiscal respons is heartless and immor __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ what is heartless is to imperil our children __PUNCT__
and what is immor is to imperil the strength of the nation that wa found __PUNCT__ under god __PUNCT__ and preserv by hi hand __PUNCT__
thi is a pivot moment in the histori of the countri __PUNCT__
we will either be led by men and women who care onli for the present __PUNCT__ who promis more and ask for less __PUNCT__ and who ignor the tighten noos of debt __PUNCT__ or we will be led by those who believ that deficit matter and who have the courag to act with fiscal respons __PUNCT__

we stop rent fanci confer room for board meet and charg board member __MONEY__ for a can of coke and __MONEY__ for a slice of pizza __PUNCT__
we cut the budget for thing like decor __PUNCT__ brochur __PUNCT__ travel __PUNCT__ and motiv speaker __PUNCT__
we could get all the motiv we need from the perform of our athlet __PUNCT__
we want the entir organ to know that everi penni matter __PUNCT__
i us the commonsens principl i had reli on so mani time in the privat sector to come up with __MONEY__ million in immedi budget cut __PUNCT__
when it wa all said and done __PUNCT__ our olymp were among the most success ever __PUNCT__ and instead of a deficit __PUNCT__ we produc __MONEY__ million dollar for an endow fund __PUNCT__
in busi __PUNCT__ in the olymp __PUNCT__ and in massachusett __PUNCT__ i learn how to elimin deficit and to produc result __PUNCT__
when i get to the white hous __PUNCT__ no on will need to teach me how to balanc budget __PUNCT__
i been do that for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
it is time to level with the american peopl about what it will take to cut spend and balanc our budget __PUNCT__ to set honest goal and present a credibl plan to achiev them __PUNCT__
thi won't be easi __PUNCT__
it requir tough choic __PUNCT__
mani believ it can't be done __PUNCT__
i believ it must be done __PUNCT__
i believ in the american peopl __PUNCT__
when the nation call __PUNCT__ american deliv __PUNCT__
over the last __NUM__ month __PUNCT__ presid obama ha grown feder spend to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the economi __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the gdp __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i pledg to reduc spend to __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of gdp by the end of my first term __PUNCT__
i will cap it at that level __PUNCT__
and further __PUNCT__ i will put us on a path to a balanc budget and a constitut amend that requir the govern to spend onli what it earn __PUNCT__
to reach the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ goal __PUNCT__ we need to find almost __MONEY__ billion in save a year in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
upon take offic __PUNCT__ i will immedi cut discretionari spend and submit a budget that return spend to pre __PUNCT__ obama level __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ as i said at the citadel __PUNCT__ i will revers presid obama massiv defens cut __PUNCT__
ani save we will find in the defens budget we will re __PUNCT__ direct to rebuild our navi and our air forc __PUNCT__ to add activ duti soldier and sailor __PUNCT__ and to provid the care our veteran deserv __PUNCT__
the world ha not becom a less danger place __PUNCT__
we must preserv our commit to a militari that is so strong __PUNCT__ no nation would ever think of test it __PUNCT__
my roadmap to a smaller __PUNCT__ simpler govern combin three separ approach __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ elimin and cut program __PUNCT__
that will start with the easiest cut of all __PUNCT__ i will repeal obamacar __PUNCT__
thi alon will save us __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
it bad law __PUNCT__ bad polici __PUNCT__ and when i presid __PUNCT__ the bad new of obamacar will be over __PUNCT__
there ar mani other feder program that we must either dramat scale back or cut out entir __PUNCT__
for each program __PUNCT__ i will ask thi question __PUNCT__ is thi program so critic __PUNCT__ so essenti __PUNCT__ that we should borrow monei from china to pai for it __PUNCT__ i like amtrak __PUNCT__ but i not will to borrow __MONEY__ billion a year to subsid it __PUNCT__
i like the nation endow for the art __PUNCT__ the nation endow for the human __PUNCT__ and the corpor for public broadcast __PUNCT__ but i refus to borrow almost __MONEY__ billion a year from china to pai for them __PUNCT__
and then there foreign aid __PUNCT__
did you know that we give __MONEY__ million a year in foreign aid to china __PUNCT__ i will stop send monei to ani countri that can take care of itself __PUNCT__
and no foreign aid will go to countri that oppos american interest __PUNCT__
we spend __MONEY__ million a year on group like plan parenthood __PUNCT__ which provid abort or abort __PUNCT__ relat servic __PUNCT__
it long past time for that to be over __PUNCT__
so first __PUNCT__ we will elimin or cut program that ar not absolut essenti __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ we return numer feder program to the state __PUNCT__
that becaus innov __PUNCT__ cost manag __PUNCT__ and reduct of fraud and abus can far exce what washington is abl to achiev __PUNCT__
medicaid is a prime exampl __PUNCT__
we need to turn medicaid back to the state and allow them to craft the healthcar solut that suit their citizen best __PUNCT__
by limit the growth of medicaid fund to cpi plu on percent __PUNCT__ we will save __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ nine feder agenc run __NUM__ differ feder worker retrain program at a cost of __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
just imagin how much is spent on overhead __PUNCT__
i will send those workforc train dollar back to the state __PUNCT__ empow them to retrain worker in wai that fit the need of their respect economi __PUNCT__
in the process __PUNCT__ we can save billion of dollar __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ in addit to cut program and return program to state __PUNCT__ there is a third approach to rein __PUNCT__ in feder spend __PUNCT__
it is to impos far greater product and effici on govern itself __PUNCT__ just like is regularli done in everi success busi in the countri __PUNCT__
let me give you an exampl of just how out of control govern ha becom __PUNCT__
former secretari of the navi john lehman report that dure the second world war __PUNCT__ we commiss __NUM__ ship a year __PUNCT__ and the navi purchas depart that year __PUNCT__ which thei call the bureau of ship __PUNCT__ had __NUM__ employe __PUNCT__
by the time john wa secretari dure the reagan administr __PUNCT__ we commiss __NUM__ ship a year __PUNCT__
and navi purchas had grown to __NUM__ peopl __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we commiss __NUM__ ship a year __PUNCT__
and purchas __PUNCT__ it grown to __NUM__ peopl __PUNCT__
a busi like that would be out of busi __PUNCT__
we must cut the size of the feder workforc __PUNCT__
on presid obama watch __PUNCT__ we ad more than __NUM__ feder worker __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar increasingli work to support the govern __PUNCT__
it should be the other wai around __PUNCT__
i will reduc the feder payrol by at least __NUM__ __PUNCT__ save __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
and we can save billion more by cut extran feder contractor __PUNCT__
it not just the size of the feder workforc __PUNCT__ it also the cost __PUNCT__
sinc presid obama took offic __PUNCT__ the number of feder worker make __MONEY__ or more ha doubl __PUNCT__
i will limit the salari and benefit of worker in the public sector to those for worker in the privat sector __PUNCT__
public servant should not get a better deal than the taxpay thei work for __PUNCT__
by link govern pai with privat sector pai __PUNCT__ we will save as much as __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
there ar still other wai to make the feder govern work more effici and effect __PUNCT__
we will attack the rampant fraud that exist in numer govern program by enact far stiffer penalti for those who steal from taxpay __PUNCT__
cut improp payment in half can save more than __MONEY__ billion a year __PUNCT__
and we can save nearli __MONEY__ billion a year by repeal a polit giveawai that protect union from competit and drive up the cost of govern contract __PUNCT__ it time to repeal davi bacon __PUNCT__
we will also find save by combin certain govern agenc and depart __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ it make veri littl sens that trade polici and program ar administ by so mani offic in so mani depart __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ trade matter ar hous in the offic of the u. __PUNCT__ trade repres __PUNCT__ the depart of commerc __PUNCT__ the intern trade commiss __PUNCT__ the intern trade administr __PUNCT__ the depart of homeland secur __PUNCT__ and the depart of the treasuri __PUNCT__
and guess who gather our trade data __PUNCT__ none of the abov __PUNCT__ it the censu bureau __PUNCT__
too mani chef not onli spoil the broth __PUNCT__ thei make it ined and prohibit expens __PUNCT__
in sum __PUNCT__ i will make the feder govern simpler __PUNCT__ smaller __PUNCT__ and smarter by elimin program __PUNCT__ by send program back to the state __PUNCT__ and by make govern more product __PUNCT__
i will provid for the nation defens __PUNCT__ enforc our law __PUNCT__ preserv our safeti net __PUNCT__ and honor all our promis to our elderli __PUNCT__
thi is the right cours for a moral nation __PUNCT__
deficit do in fact matter __PUNCT__
thei matter if we want to convinc entrepreneur to start busi __PUNCT__
thei matter if we want employ to start hire __PUNCT__
thei matter if america is to avoid the shoal of econom calam __PUNCT__
thei matter if america is to remain the shine citi on a hill __PUNCT__
to those who sai that deficit don't matter __PUNCT__ to those who spend and borrow to win the prais of the short __PUNCT__ sight __PUNCT__ we assert that you ar in the wrong __PUNCT__ and we ar in the right __PUNCT__
my dad us to sai that __PUNCT__ the pursuit of the difficult make men strong __PUNCT__ our next presid is go to face difficult choic __PUNCT__
among these will be the futur of social secur and medicar __PUNCT__
in their current form __PUNCT__ these program will go bankrupt __PUNCT__
i know that __PUNCT__ you know that __PUNCT__ and even our friend in the other parti know that __PUNCT__
the differ is that i will be honest about strengthen and preserv them __PUNCT__ and thei won't __PUNCT__
presid obama ha fail to articul a singl seriou idea to save social secur __PUNCT__
i believ we can save social secur with a few commonsens reform __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ there will be no chang for retire or those near retir __PUNCT__
no chang __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ for the next gener of retire __PUNCT__ we should slowli rais the retir ag __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ for the next gener of retire __PUNCT__ we should slow the growth in benefit for those with higher incom __PUNCT__
while presid obama ha been silent on social secur __PUNCT__ hi agenda for medicar is disastr __PUNCT__
he the onli presid in modern histori who ha cut medicar for senior __PUNCT__ do not forget __PUNCT__ it wa presid obama who cut __MONEY__ billion from medicar __PUNCT__ not to preserv it or sustain it __PUNCT__ but to pai for hi vaunt obamacar __PUNCT__
and he put the futur of medicar in the hand of __NUM__ unelect bureaucrat __PUNCT__
these bureaucrat have the power to enact further cut to medicar without congression approv __PUNCT__ even if those cut overturn a law previous pass by congress __PUNCT__
presid obama so __PUNCT__ call medicar reform could lead to the ration or denial of care for senior on medicar __PUNCT__
unlik presid obama __PUNCT__ our next presid must protect medicar __PUNCT__ improv the program __PUNCT__ and keep it sustain for gener to come __PUNCT__
sever principl will guid my effort __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ medicar should not chang for anyon in the program or soon to be in it __PUNCT__
we should honor our commit to our senior __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ as with social secur __PUNCT__ tax hike ar not the solut __PUNCT__
we couldn't tax our wai out of unfund liabil so larg __PUNCT__ even if we want to __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ tomorrow senior should have the freedom to choos what their health coverag look like __PUNCT__
younger american todai __PUNCT__ when thei turn __NUM__ should have a choic between tradit medicar and other privat healthcar plan that provid at least the same level of benefit __PUNCT__
competit will lower cost and increas the qualiti of healthcar for tomorrow senior __PUNCT__
the feder govern will help senior pai for the option thei choos __PUNCT__ with a level of support that ensur all can obtain the coverag thei need __PUNCT__
those with lower incom will receiv more gener assist __PUNCT__
beneficiari can keep the save from less expens option __PUNCT__ or thei can choos to pai more for a costlier plan __PUNCT__
final __PUNCT__ as with social secur __PUNCT__ the elig ag should slowli increas to keep pace with increas in longev __PUNCT__
these idea will give tomorrow senior the same kind of choic that most american have in their healthcar todai __PUNCT__
the futur of medicar should be mark by competit __PUNCT__ choic __PUNCT__ and innov __PUNCT__ rather than bureaucraci __PUNCT__ stagnat __PUNCT__ and bankruptci __PUNCT__
our path for the futur of social secur and medicar is honesti and secur __PUNCT__ their is demagogueri and decept __PUNCT__
the plan i propos to make govern simpler __PUNCT__ smaller __PUNCT__ and smarter repres the biggest fundament chang to the feder govern in modern histori __PUNCT__
it is a chang we must make if the word __PUNCT__ full faith and credit of the unit state __PUNCT__ ar to mean anyth at all __PUNCT__
we not the first peopl to come to thi realiz __PUNCT__
and we won't be the first peopl to be critic for believ that respons is a virtu __PUNCT__
presid ronald reagan share our convict __PUNCT__
in hi first inaugur address __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ it is not my intent to do awai with govern __PUNCT__
it is rather to make it work __PUNCT__ work with us __PUNCT__ not over us __PUNCT__ stand by our side __PUNCT__ not ride on our back __PUNCT__
govern can and must provid opportun __PUNCT__ not smother it __PUNCT__ foster product __PUNCT__ not stifl it __PUNCT__ the task befor us now is to reaffirm our convict in the belief and valu that unit us __PUNCT__ in the challeng and opportun that face us __PUNCT__ and in the victori that await us __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
god bless you __PUNCT__
and god bless america __PUNCT__
