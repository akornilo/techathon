we share a convict that the america we love wa in troubl and adrift without strong leadership __PUNCT__
three year of barack obama had brought us fewer job and shrink paycheck __PUNCT__ but mani of us believ we were in danger of lose someth more than the valu of home and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ k __PUNCT__ s __PUNCT__
after the year of too mani apolog and not enough job __PUNCT__ histor drop in incom and histor high in ga price __PUNCT__ of a presid who doesn't hesit to us all mean necessari to forc obamacar on the american public but lead from behind in world affair __PUNCT__ it time to sai __PUNCT__ enough __PUNCT__
we know our futur is better and brighter than these troubl time __PUNCT__
we still believ in america __PUNCT__ and we deserv a presid who believ in us __PUNCT__
yesterdai i gave a speech at the univers of chicago __PUNCT__ not far from here and where professor barack obama taught constitut law __PUNCT__
it wa a speech on econom freedom and as i wa write it __PUNCT__ i thought back to the lifetim of experi i had learn the uniqu geniu of the american free enterpris system __PUNCT__
it start when i wa just a kid __PUNCT__ and my dad __PUNCT__ who never graduat from colleg __PUNCT__ would tell me about hi dad __PUNCT__ who wa a contractor and never quit made it but never gave up __PUNCT__
later i help start compani that began just as an idea and somehow made it through all the inevit difficulti to creat thousand of job __PUNCT__
those job help famili bui their first home __PUNCT__ put kid through school __PUNCT__ live better live __PUNCT__ dream a littl bigger __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ i live and breath job __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ and the economi __PUNCT__
i had success and failur but each step of the wai __PUNCT__ i learn a littl more about what it is that make our american system so power __PUNCT__
you can't learn that teach constitut law __PUNCT__
you can't learn that as a commun organ __PUNCT__
the simpl truth is that thi presid just doesn't understand the geniu of america economi __PUNCT__ or the secret of our success __PUNCT__
the american economi is fuel by freedom __PUNCT__
econom freedom is the onli forc that ha consist succeed in lift peopl out of poverti __PUNCT__
it is the onli principl that ha ever creat sustain prosper __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ over the last three year __PUNCT__ thi administr ha been engag in an assault on our freedom __PUNCT__
under presid obama __PUNCT__ bureaucrat prevent drill rig from go to work in the gulf __PUNCT__
thei keep coal from be mine __PUNCT__
thei imped the reliabl suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__
thei even tell farmer what their __NUM__ __PUNCT__ year __PUNCT__ old son and daughter can and can't do on the famili farm __PUNCT__
the administr assault on freedom ha kept thi so __PUNCT__ call recoveri from meet their project __PUNCT__ let alon our expect __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ the presid is try to eras hi record with rhetor __PUNCT__
just the other dai __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ we ar inventor __PUNCT__
we ar builder __PUNCT__
we ar maker of thing __PUNCT__
we ar thoma edison __PUNCT__
we ar the wright brother __PUNCT__
we ar bill gate __PUNCT__
we ar steve job __PUNCT__
that true __PUNCT__
but the problem is __PUNCT__ he still barack obama __PUNCT__
and under thi presid __PUNCT__ those pioneer would have face an uphil battl to innov __PUNCT__ invent __PUNCT__ and creat __PUNCT__
under dodd __PUNCT__ frank __PUNCT__ thei would have struggl to get a loan from their commun bank __PUNCT__
a regul would have shut down the wright brother for their __PUNCT__ dust pollut __PUNCT__
and the govern would have ban thoma edison light bulb __PUNCT__
oh __PUNCT__ that right __PUNCT__
thei just did __PUNCT__
the real cost of these misguid polici ar the idea that ar never pursu and the dream that ar never realiz __PUNCT__
for centuri __PUNCT__ the american dream ha meant the opportun to build someth new __PUNCT__
some of america greatest success stori ar peopl who start out with noth but a good idea and a corner in their garag __PUNCT__
but todai __PUNCT__ american who want to start a new busi or launch a new ventur don't see promis and opportun __PUNCT__
thei see govern stand in their wai __PUNCT__
we onc built the interst highwai system and the hoover dam __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we can't even build a pipelin __PUNCT__
we onc led the world in manufactur __PUNCT__ export __PUNCT__ and infrastructur invest __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we lead the world in lawsuit __PUNCT__
when we replac a law professor with a businessman __PUNCT__ that will end __PUNCT__
everi great innov __PUNCT__ everi world __PUNCT__ chang busi breakthrough begin with a dream __PUNCT__
and noth is more fragil than a dream __PUNCT__
the geniu of america is that we nurtur these dream and the dreamer __PUNCT__
we honor them __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we reward them __PUNCT__
that part of what is uniqu brilliant about america __PUNCT__
but dai by dai __PUNCT__ job __PUNCT__ kill regul by job __PUNCT__ kill regul __PUNCT__ bureaucrat by bureaucrat __PUNCT__ thi presid is crush the dream and the dreamer __PUNCT__
the proof is in thi weak recoveri __PUNCT__
thi administr think our economi is struggl becaus the stimulu wa too small __PUNCT__
the truth is our economi is struggl becaus the govern is too big __PUNCT__
you and i know what presid obama still ha not learn __PUNCT__ even after three year and hundr of billion of dollar in spend __PUNCT__ the govern doe not creat prosper __PUNCT__ prosper is the product of free market and free peopl __PUNCT__
thi __DATE__ __PUNCT__ we face a defin decis __PUNCT__
our choic will not be on of parti or person __PUNCT__
thi elect will be about principl __PUNCT__
our econom freedom will be on the ballot __PUNCT__
i am offer a real choic and a new begin __PUNCT__
i am run for presid becaus i have the experi and the vision to get us out of thi mess __PUNCT__
we know what barack obama vision of america is __PUNCT__ we all live it the last three year __PUNCT__
mine is veri differ __PUNCT__
i see an america where we know the prospect for our children will be better than our own __PUNCT__ where the pursuit of success unit us __PUNCT__ not divid us __PUNCT__ when a govern final understand that it better for more to pai less in tax than for a few to pai more __PUNCT__ where the valu we pass on to our children ar greater than the debt we leav them __PUNCT__ where poverti is defeat by opportun __PUNCT__ not enabl a govern check __PUNCT__
i see an america that is humbl but never humbl __PUNCT__ that lead but is never led __PUNCT__
todai we took an import step toward that america __PUNCT__
tomorrow __PUNCT__ we take anoth __PUNCT__
each dai we move closer not just to victori but to a better america __PUNCT__
join us __PUNCT__
togeth __PUNCT__ we will ensur that america greatest dai ar still ahead __PUNCT__
thank you and god bless america __PUNCT__
