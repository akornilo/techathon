and i tell you that not everi busi made it and there were good dai and bad dai __PUNCT__ but everi dai wa a lesson __PUNCT__
and after __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ i know how to lead us out of thi stagnant obama economi and into a job __PUNCT__ creat recoveri __PUNCT__
four year ago barack obama dazzl us in front of greek column with sweep promis of hope and chang __PUNCT__
but after we came down to earth __PUNCT__ after the celebr and parad __PUNCT__ what do we have to show for three and a half year of presid obama __PUNCT__
is it easier to make end meet __PUNCT__ is it easier to sell your home or bui a new on __PUNCT__ have you save what you need for retir __PUNCT__ ar you make more in your job __PUNCT__ do you have a better chanc to get a better job __PUNCT__ do you pai less at the pump __PUNCT__
if the answer were __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ to those question __PUNCT__ then presid obama would be run for re __PUNCT__ elect base on hi achiev __PUNCT__ and rightli so __PUNCT__
but becaus he ha fail __PUNCT__ he will run a campaign of divers __PUNCT__ distract __PUNCT__ and distort __PUNCT__
that kind of campaign mai have work at anoth place and in a differ time __PUNCT__
but not here and not now __PUNCT__
it still about the economi __PUNCT__ and we not stupid __PUNCT__
peopl ar hurt in america __PUNCT__
and we know that someth is wrong __PUNCT__ terribl wrong with the direct of the countri __PUNCT__
we know that thi elect is about the kind of america we will live in and the kind of america we will leav to futur gener __PUNCT__
when it come to the charact of america __PUNCT__ presid obama and i have veri differ vision __PUNCT__
govern is at the center of hi vision __PUNCT__
it dispens the benefit __PUNCT__ borrow what it cannot take __PUNCT__ and consum a greater and greater share of the economi __PUNCT__
with obamacar fulli instal __PUNCT__ govern will come to control half the economi __PUNCT__ and we will have effect ceas to be a free enterpris societi __PUNCT__
thi presid is put us on a path where our live will be rule by bureaucrat and board __PUNCT__ commiss and czar __PUNCT__
he ask us to accept that washington know best __PUNCT__ and can provid all __PUNCT__
we alreadi seen where thi path lead __PUNCT__
it erod freedom __PUNCT__
it deaden the entrepreneuri spirit __PUNCT__
and it hurt the veri peopl it suppos to help __PUNCT__
those who promis to spread the wealth around onli ever succe in spread poverti __PUNCT__
other nation have chosen that path __PUNCT__
it lead to chronic high unemploy __PUNCT__ crush debt __PUNCT__ and stagnant wage __PUNCT__
i have a veri differ vision for america __PUNCT__ and of our futur __PUNCT__
it is an america driven by freedom __PUNCT__ where free peopl __PUNCT__ pursu happi in their own uniqu wai __PUNCT__ creat free enterpris that emploi more and more american __PUNCT__
becaus there ar so mani enterpris that ar succeed __PUNCT__ the competit for hard __PUNCT__ work __PUNCT__ educ and skill employe is intens __PUNCT__ and so wage and salari rise __PUNCT__
i see an america with a grow middl class __PUNCT__ with rise standard of live __PUNCT__
i see children even more success than their parent __PUNCT__ some success even beyond their wildest dream __PUNCT__ and other congratul them for their achiev __PUNCT__ not attack them for it __PUNCT__
thi america is fundament fair __PUNCT__
we will stop the unfair of urban children be deni access to the good school of their choic __PUNCT__ we will stop the unfair of politician give taxpay monei to their friend __PUNCT__ busi __PUNCT__ we will stop the unfair of requir union worker to contribut to politician not of their choos __PUNCT__ we will stop the unfair of govern worker get better pai and benefit than the taxpay thei serv __PUNCT__ and we will stop the unfair of on gener pass larger and larger debt on to the next __PUNCT__
in the america i see __PUNCT__ charact and choic matter __PUNCT__
and educ __PUNCT__ hard work __PUNCT__ and live within our mean ar valu and reward __PUNCT__
and poverti will be defeat __PUNCT__ not with a govern check __PUNCT__ but with respect and achiev that is taught by parent __PUNCT__ learn in school __PUNCT__ and practic in the workplac __PUNCT__
thi is the america that wa won for us by the nation founder __PUNCT__ and earn for us by the greatest gener __PUNCT__
it is the america that ha produc the most innov __PUNCT__ most product __PUNCT__ and the most power economi in the world __PUNCT__
as i look around at the million of american without work __PUNCT__ the graduat who can't get a job __PUNCT__ the soldier who return home to an unemploy line __PUNCT__ it break my heart __PUNCT__
thi doe not have to be __PUNCT__
it is the result of fail leadership and of a faulti vision __PUNCT__
we will restor the promis of america onli if we restor the principl of freedom and opportun that made america the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ the hill befor us is a littl steep but we have alwai been a nation of big stepper __PUNCT__
mani american have given up on thi presid but thei haven't ever thought about give up __PUNCT__
not on themselv __PUNCT__
not on each other __PUNCT__
and not on america __PUNCT__
in the dai ahead __PUNCT__ join me in the next step toward that destin of __DATE__ __PUNCT__ when across america we can give a sigh of relief and know that the promis of america ha been kept __PUNCT__
the dreamer can dream a littl bigger __PUNCT__ the help want sign can be dust off __PUNCT__ and we can start again __PUNCT__
and thi time we get it right __PUNCT__
we stop the dai of apolog for success at home and never again apolog for america abroad __PUNCT__
there wa a time __PUNCT__ not so long ago __PUNCT__ when each of us could walk a littl taller and stand a littl straighter becaus we had a gift that no on els in the world share __PUNCT__
we were american __PUNCT__
that meant someth differ to each of us but it meant someth special to all of us __PUNCT__
we knew it without question __PUNCT__
and so did the world __PUNCT__
those dai ar come back __PUNCT__
that our destini __PUNCT__
we believ in america __PUNCT__
we believ in ourselv __PUNCT__
our greatest dai ar still ahead __PUNCT__
