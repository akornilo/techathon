it high time to take govern apart and put it back togeth __PUNCT__ but thi time simpler __PUNCT__ smarter and smaller __PUNCT__
let talk about social conservat too __PUNCT__
massachusett becam center stage for the liber social agenda __PUNCT__ sort of san francisco east __PUNCT__ nanci pelosi style __PUNCT__
ten month into my term __PUNCT__ the massachusett suprem judici court said our constitut requir gai marriag __PUNCT__

to me __PUNCT__ a fundament principl of democraci is at stake __PUNCT__
it is the peopl who ar sovereign in america __PUNCT__ not a few folk in black robe __PUNCT__
judg add thing that aren't in the constitut __PUNCT__ and thei take awai thing that ar in the constitut __PUNCT__
in that regard __PUNCT__ thei let the campaign financ lobbi take awai first amend right __PUNCT__
if i presid __PUNCT__ i will fight to repeal mccain __PUNCT__ feingold __PUNCT__
anoth aspect of american sovereignti is the secur of our border __PUNCT__
the current system is a virtual concret wall against those who have skill and educ __PUNCT__ but it a wide open walk across the border for those that have neither __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ kennedi isn't the answer __PUNCT__
as governor __PUNCT__ i took a veri differ approach __PUNCT__
i author our state polic to enforc immigr law __PUNCT__
i veto a tuition break for illeg and said no to driver licens __PUNCT__
mccain __PUNCT__ kennedi give benefit to illeg that would cost taxpay million __PUNCT__
and more importantli __PUNCT__ amnesti didn't work __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ and it won't work todai __PUNCT__
the new gener of challeng we face todai includ challeng to our nation secur as well __PUNCT__
violent __PUNCT__ jihadist __PUNCT__ ar intent on replac moder islam govern with a caliph __PUNCT__
to do that __PUNCT__ thei seek the collaps of our economi and our militari __PUNCT__
we will defeat the violent jihad with a two __PUNCT__ part strategi __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ an unquestion strong militari __PUNCT__
the best alli peac ha in the world is a strong america __PUNCT__
we need more men and women in the militari __PUNCT__ better armament __PUNCT__ and a strateg defens initi __PUNCT__
and there a second aspect of our strategi __PUNCT__ we must bring togeth all the civil nation of the world in what might be call a second marshal plan __PUNCT__
togeth with them __PUNCT__ and with volunt __PUNCT__ busi and ngo __PUNCT__ we must support moder muslim nation and peopl __PUNCT__
thei need public school that ar not wahabi school __PUNCT__ the rule of law __PUNCT__ properti right __PUNCT__ modern bank and agricultur and pro __PUNCT__ growth econom polici __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ it is the muslim peopl themselv who will elimin radic jihad __PUNCT__
iraq is just on front in the war __PUNCT__
we remov hussein __PUNCT__ but afterward __PUNCT__ we were under __PUNCT__ prepar __PUNCT__ under __PUNCT__ plan __PUNCT__ under __PUNCT__ man __PUNCT__ and under __PUNCT__ manag __PUNCT__
but walk awai now or divid the countri and then walk awai would have real and sever risk for america and for our troop __PUNCT__
i support the troop surg for that reason __PUNCT__
and on thing i know __PUNCT__ we shouldn't let nanci pelosi and harri reid dictat our battl strategi to the command in the field or to the command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief __PUNCT__
conservat is a belief in strength __PUNCT__
it is becaus of america strength that we don't all speak german and that our kid don't all speak russian __PUNCT__
and it is becaus of america strength that our grandchildren will not have to speak farsi or arab or chines __PUNCT__
america must remain the world militari superpow __PUNCT__
that is a first principl of conservat __PUNCT__
to remain the militari superpow __PUNCT__ we must remain the world econom superpow as well __PUNCT__
you can't be a tier i militari with a tier ii economi __PUNCT__ the soviet union tri to keep that up for a while __PUNCT__ and lost __PUNCT__
it inconceiv to us that we could ever be pass econom __PUNCT__
but __NUM__ year ago __PUNCT__ it wa inconceiv that anyon could have pass england or franc __PUNCT__
but we did __PUNCT__
and if you look east __PUNCT__ you can see that we ar face much more difficult competit from asia than we have face befor __PUNCT__
thei want to move the center of manufactur and technolog and innov from america to asia __PUNCT__
we mai just smile __PUNCT__ but don't forget what will roger said __PUNCT__ even if you on the right track __PUNCT__ if you don't move __PUNCT__ you get run over __PUNCT__ america will move __PUNCT__ but the question is __PUNCT__ in what direct __PUNCT__
histori can be a guid __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ centuri saw two econom system pit against each other __PUNCT__
our wa built on free enterpris __PUNCT__ free trade and the primaci of the individu __PUNCT__
the soviet wa built on govern command and control __PUNCT__ and the primaci of the state __PUNCT__
our produc the most power economi in the world that ha given it citizen a standard of live our grandpar never dream possibl __PUNCT__ their produc a downward spiral standard of live and eventu collaps __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ centuri histori lesson is that america economi is strong becaus we put our trust in freedom __PUNCT__ in the american peopl __PUNCT__ and in the free enterpris thei creat __PUNCT__
if we ar to keep america strong __PUNCT__ we must turn to the sourc of america strength __PUNCT__
liber think that govern is the sourc of our great __PUNCT__
thei wrong __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar the sourc of our strength __PUNCT__ hard work __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ skill __PUNCT__ famili __PUNCT__ orient __PUNCT__ will to sacrific for their famili and their countri __PUNCT__ god __PUNCT__ fear __PUNCT__ freedom __PUNCT__ love american peopl __PUNCT__
thei alwai have been the sourc of our strength and thei alwai will be __PUNCT__
and so if we need to call on the strength of america __PUNCT__ you don't strengthen govern __PUNCT__ you strengthen the american peopl __PUNCT__
you strengthen the american peopl by let them keep more of their own monei __PUNCT__ and not tax their famili at death __PUNCT__
you strengthen the american peopl by make sure that the voic of million of voter trump the voic of unelect judg __PUNCT__
you strengthen the american peopl by secur our border and by insist that the children who come legal to thi land ar taught in english __PUNCT__
and perhap most importantli __PUNCT__ you strengthen the american peopl when you strengthen the american famili __PUNCT__
marriag must come befor children becaus everi child deserv a mother and a father __PUNCT__
thi is not the time for us to shrink from conserv principl __PUNCT__
it is time for us to stand in strength __PUNCT__
becaus america face unpreced challeng __PUNCT__ strength is the onli answer __PUNCT__
strong militari __PUNCT__ strong economi __PUNCT__ strong famili __PUNCT__
thirti year ago __PUNCT__ in challeng time __PUNCT__ a great coalit wa forg in these hall __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ we face a new gener of challeng __PUNCT__
if we in thi room lock our arm togeth __PUNCT__ we can forg the polit will to rebuild our militari might __PUNCT__
if we in thi room will simpli march forward we can propel america growth and prosper to lead to the world __PUNCT__
if we in thi room lift up our ey __PUNCT__ we will lift the spirit of the nation __PUNCT__
now is the time __PUNCT__ thi is the place __PUNCT__ for us to stand togeth __PUNCT__ to lead a great coalit of strength __PUNCT__ for our famili __PUNCT__ for our futur __PUNCT__ for america __PUNCT__
mai god bless thi great land __PUNCT__
