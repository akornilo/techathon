it good to be back home in mackinac __PUNCT__
on of the thing i like best is that there ar no car on the island __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ that al gore vision for all of america __PUNCT__
i spent a few great summer here __PUNCT__ up in that big white home on the hill __PUNCT__
we need to get a republican famili back in there again __PUNCT__
and we need to keep a republican famili in the white hous in washington as well __PUNCT__
i don't have to tell you that my dad made a mark on michigan __PUNCT__
and he made a mark on me __PUNCT__
and i guess that is at the heart of thing __PUNCT__ he a big part of why i run for presid todai __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ when he wa the presid of american motor __PUNCT__ he gave a speech in which he report the follow convers __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ my nine year old son __PUNCT__ that would be me __PUNCT__ came home from school and said __PUNCT__ mom __PUNCT__ we realli build the best car __PUNCT__ don't we __PUNCT__
she said __PUNCT__ why mitt __PUNCT__ of cours we do __PUNCT__
why do you ask __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ if we build the best car __PUNCT__ why is it that less than three percent of the peopl agre with us __PUNCT__
after my dad heard of thi convers __PUNCT__ he took me asid and said __PUNCT__ look __PUNCT__ mitt __PUNCT__ size doesn't alwai indic strength and popular doesn't alwai indic truth __PUNCT__ and sale volum doesn't alwai indic valu __PUNCT__
and then he ad __PUNCT__ right alwai prevail __PUNCT__
quit a dad __PUNCT__ teach lesson like that to hi nine year old son __PUNCT__
lesson i have taken to heart __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ a few year older __PUNCT__ as i have look at the histori of thi nation __PUNCT__ i have becom convinc that right doe inde prevail __PUNCT__
america ha face and overcom great challeng __PUNCT__
these have becom defin moment __PUNCT__ inflect point __PUNCT__ where the cours of our histori ha chang __PUNCT__
i believ that we ar at an inflect point todai __PUNCT__
forc of global __PUNCT__ the emerg of new econom powerhous like china and india __PUNCT__ and the spread of radic violent jihad have creat a perfect storm that will chang the cours of our nation __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ we face unpreced challeng in secur our border __PUNCT__ protect the famili __PUNCT__ creat new job and achiev energi secur __PUNCT__
the peopl of thi great nation have alwai taken a hand in shape our own destini __PUNCT__
i believ the american peopl will rise to the occas onc again __PUNCT__ as we have alwai done befor __PUNCT__
but at thi critic time in our nation histori __PUNCT__ washington is fail us __PUNCT__
i think we have to admit that the blame doesn't all belong to the democrat __PUNCT__
we republican have to put our own hous in order __PUNCT__
we can't be like democrat __PUNCT__ a parti of big spender __PUNCT__
we can't pretend our border ar secur from illeg immigr __PUNCT__
we can't have ethic standard that ar a punch line for jai leno __PUNCT__
when republican act like democrat __PUNCT__ america lose __PUNCT__
we got to start act like republican __PUNCT__ not earmark republican __PUNCT__ not big govern republican __PUNCT__ but like reagan republican and teddi roosevelt republican __PUNCT__
thei led us along the right cours __PUNCT__
it time for us to show the confid my dad had that right will alwai prevail __PUNCT__
it time for chang in washington and chang begin with us __PUNCT__
republican for chang believ in small govern __PUNCT__
govern should be restrain so that the freedom and vital of individu and enterpris can be unleash __PUNCT__
compar to free market and free enterpris __PUNCT__ govern is slow to act __PUNCT__ wast __PUNCT__ duplic __PUNCT__ bureaucrat __PUNCT__ ineffici __PUNCT__ ineffect __PUNCT__ and unrespons __PUNCT__
have i left anyth out __PUNCT__ other than that __PUNCT__ govern isn't all bad __PUNCT__
hillari clinton fundament doesn't trust the privat sector __PUNCT__
of cours not __PUNCT__ she never work in the privat sector __PUNCT__ except to sue peopl __PUNCT__
so when she see a problem in the marketplac __PUNCT__ she natur think more govern and higher tax ar the solut __PUNCT__
she see the problem in healthcar __PUNCT__ for exampl __PUNCT__ and propos more govern __PUNCT__
with her plan __PUNCT__ patient would have to get us to hear these word __PUNCT__ the bureaucrat will see you now __PUNCT__ the right answer is less govern __PUNCT__ less regul __PUNCT__ more individu respons __PUNCT__ and more of the market dynam that propel the rest of our economi __PUNCT__

here in michigan __PUNCT__ governor granholm ha taken thi state to the brink __PUNCT__
by not restructur state program and by not shrink govern __PUNCT__ she ha precipit a hobbesian choic __PUNCT__ rais tax or shut down govern __PUNCT__
