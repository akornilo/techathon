and he said __PUNCT__ great __PUNCT__ i like you to give on __PUNCT__
i want to thank you for the work that you do becaus it come at a critic time __PUNCT__
i notic that i not the onli person in thi countri who think thi is a critic time __PUNCT__
the great author david mccullough __PUNCT__ the author of john adam and truman and __NUM__ wa recent speak at the white hous __PUNCT__
he spoke on the life of john adam __PUNCT__
after he wa finish someon in the audienc said __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ mccullough what wa the most critic period in the histori of america __PUNCT__ the most critic five __PUNCT__ year period __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ from __NUM__ to right now __PUNCT__
thi is the most critic time in the histori of america __PUNCT__
you think about the reason he mai have said that __PUNCT__
we under attack from jihadist __PUNCT__
we also see the emerg of asia __PUNCT__ a new competitor __PUNCT__
good new becaus thei come into econom vital __PUNCT__ a challeng as well for our economi __PUNCT__
we also spend wai too much monei __PUNCT__ number three __PUNCT__
number four __PUNCT__ we us wai too much oil __PUNCT__
but number five __PUNCT__ the cultur of america is under attack __PUNCT__
now some peopl sai wait __PUNCT__ when you talk about cultur __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ that not of the same order of magnitud as the thing you just mention __PUNCT__ jihadist and the emerg of asia __PUNCT__ spend too much monei __PUNCT__ us too much oil __PUNCT__
and i disagre __PUNCT__
there wa a book written some year ago by a fellow name david landi __PUNCT__ he a harvard professor __PUNCT__
the book wa given to me __PUNCT__
it call the wealth and poverti of nation __PUNCT__
the jacket cover includ an endors by john kenneth galbraith __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ oh boi __PUNCT__ thi is go to be some liber diatrib __PUNCT__
i read through it and found it pretti scholarli __PUNCT__
and after about __NUM__ page __PUNCT__ he conclud with roughli these word __PUNCT__ if anyth can be learn from the histori of econom develop in the world __PUNCT__ it is thi __PUNCT__ cultur make all the differ __PUNCT__
now what is it about america cultur that made us the most power nation on the earth __PUNCT__ you can think about some of those thing __PUNCT__
on is we believ in hard work as american __PUNCT__
we believ in educ __PUNCT__
we love freedom __PUNCT__
we seek opportun __PUNCT__
we take risk in order to bring a better futur for ourselv and our famili __PUNCT__
we sacrific for the futur and for our famili __PUNCT__
we ar __PUNCT__ in the word of the bibl __PUNCT__ a god __PUNCT__ fear peopl __PUNCT__
and even those among us who don't believ in god __PUNCT__ as part of what rick warren __SYMBOL__ might call a purpos __PUNCT__ driven life __PUNCT__ we live for someth greater than ourselv __PUNCT__
american respect the valu and the sanctiti of human life __PUNCT__
and american societi is built on the foundat of the famili unit __PUNCT__
now when i sai foundat __PUNCT__ we us those word frequent __PUNCT__ when i sai foundat i want to underscor the fact that a foundat is essenti for someth to stand __PUNCT__
our societi stand on the basi of the famili unit __PUNCT__
now my state suprem judici court __PUNCT__ about a year ago __PUNCT__ struck a blow against that famili unit __PUNCT__ in my view __PUNCT__
it said that our constitut __PUNCT__ written long ago by john adam __PUNCT__ requir peopl of the same gender to marri __PUNCT__
i think john adam would be surpris to hear that wa in hi constitut that he wrote __PUNCT__ but i think it underscor someth which is import for us to rememb __PUNCT__ which is __PUNCT__ we as peopl ar will to be toler and open even if we disagre with choic other peopl make __PUNCT__ we espous freedom and we respect peopl for their right to make their own choic in life __PUNCT__
but the court focus on adult right __PUNCT__
thei said if heterosexu coupl can marri __PUNCT__ then to have equal right homosexu have to also be abl to marri __PUNCT__
the mistak wa thei should have focus on the right of children __PUNCT__
becaus marriag is primarili about the develop and nurtur of children __PUNCT__
the develop of a child in the histori of civil ha been enhanc by the opportun to learn from the gender characterist of a mother and a father __PUNCT__
everi child ha a right to have a mother and a father __PUNCT__
now we seen the consequ of what happen in our state __PUNCT__
jess ventura said __PUNCT__ it hasn't hurt my marriag __PUNCT__
well that wasn't the idea __PUNCT__
again he back to adult impact __PUNCT__
let look at the children __PUNCT__
and the children __PUNCT__ the impact on children will be felt not just in a dai or two or a year or two but over gener as we think about the develop and nurtur of children __PUNCT__
and the sign and the guidepost ar alreadi there for where we head __PUNCT__
same sex coupl have approach the state and said you have to chang the birth certif __PUNCT__
it shouldn't sai mother and father __PUNCT__
it should sai parent a and parent b __PUNCT__ audienc reaction __PUNCT__
second thing __PUNCT__
second grade classroom teach from a book call the king and the king __PUNCT__ about a princ who goe around from princip to princip __PUNCT__
doesn't fall in love with the princess __PUNCT__ but instead fall in love with anoth princ __PUNCT__ and thei becom the king and the king __PUNCT__
thi is about children __PUNCT__
on of the parent in a school teach from thi book said __PUNCT__ i like my second grade littl girl not to have to be there when that book is be read __PUNCT__
and the school system said __PUNCT__ oh no __PUNCT__ she ha to be there __PUNCT__
you can't take her out of the class becaus in our state and under our constitut we can't differenti between same sex marriag and tradit marriag __PUNCT__
we don't want to be heterocentrist __PUNCT__ talk too much about mother and father __PUNCT__
thi decis ha effect which also imping potenti religi liberti __PUNCT__
cathol chariti __PUNCT__ which ha long place mani of our special need kid __PUNCT__ almost a third of the special need kid from our depart of social servic and depart of youth servic have been place by cathol chariti __PUNCT__ cathol chariti ha had to exit the adopt process in massachusett becaus thei now told thei can't prefer adopt into tradit coupl where there ar mother and father __PUNCT__ but thei must equal place children __PUNCT__ contrari to the teach and doctrin of their own church __PUNCT__ thei must place children in same sex home __PUNCT__
religi liberti is also affect by thi decis __PUNCT__
now you haven't seen an impact in most of your state __PUNCT__
you haven't seen the impact that we see in our state __PUNCT__ and hear these battl go on __PUNCT__ and you mai ask __PUNCT__ why is that __PUNCT__
there a reason __PUNCT__
after the suprem judici court pass it __PUNCT__ or hand down it decis requir same sex marriag __PUNCT__ we of cours went to work to try and get the legislatur to put in place an accept amend to the constitut to revers that decis __PUNCT__
we weren't success in that regard __PUNCT__
then we went out and got __NUM__ signatur in massachusett __PUNCT__ a record __PUNCT__ to put a ballot initi on the ballot so that citizen can vote in favor of tradit marriag __PUNCT__
for that to get on the ballot __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of the legisl have to agre __PUNCT__
that what the constitut provid __PUNCT__
and you think we be abl to get __NUM__ percent of the legisl __PUNCT__
i think we will be abl to __PUNCT__ but those that ar in control of the legislatur mai emploi variou tactic procedur move to keep a vote from everi occur __PUNCT__
now how is it that the liber would be so activ at assur that democraci can't have it wai __PUNCT__ i afraid that in some case liber love democraci onli so long as the outcom is guarante in their favor __PUNCT__
but it is our deep hope and desir that the peopl of the commonwealth of massachusett will have their constitution guarante right to vote on a matter as fundament to our societi as it veri foundat __PUNCT__ whether or not we go to have tradit marriag in massachusett or marriag with same sex coupl __PUNCT__
there anoth reason __PUNCT__ or anoth factor of what we did onc the decis came down to prevent the massiv spread of same sex marriag across the countri and that wa to enforc a __NUM__ law that wa on our book __PUNCT__
the law sai that massachusett can't marri peopl who come into massachusett from other state if it would not be legal to marri them in those state __PUNCT__
so we avoid becom the la vega of same sex marriag by enforc that law __PUNCT__
it wa challeng in the suprem judici court __PUNCT__
thei upheld it __PUNCT__
thei said it on the book __PUNCT__ it a real law __PUNCT__ and as a result the onli peopl be marri in massachusett __PUNCT__ same sex coupl __PUNCT__ ar peopl who ar resid there __PUNCT__
it ha not affect the entir nation __PUNCT__
that will chang __PUNCT__ that will chang __PUNCT__ i afraid __PUNCT__ if the state were to elect a democrat governor __PUNCT__
he sai he would support emploi whatev tactic __PUNCT__ procedur or otherwis __PUNCT__ would keep that kind of vote from occur __PUNCT__
it could chang as well even if the republican governor take my place becaus the legislatur is __NUM__ percent democrat and the democrat parti in my state ha pledg as part of it platform same sex marriag __PUNCT__
and therefor __PUNCT__ thi get me to the final action point __PUNCT__
we desper need to have a feder marriag amend __PUNCT__
i came to washington and testifi in favor of a marriag amend __PUNCT__
i wrote a letter to all the senat ask them to vote in favor of a marriag amend __PUNCT__ and i have to admit those peopl who vehement disagre with me __PUNCT__ i understand their posit and respect their right to take a differ posit __PUNCT__
i think the peopl i most upset with ar peopl who sai i agre with you __PUNCT__ governor __PUNCT__ i believ in tradit marriag __PUNCT__ but we shouldn't have a feder amend __PUNCT__
we should let thi be up to the state __PUNCT__
and i keep make the point __PUNCT__ and that is marriag is not like an activ like gambl that you can sai if you don't want it __PUNCT__ it just goe on in on state or anoth state __PUNCT__
marriag is the statu __PUNCT__
if peopl come to a la vega of same sex marriag and then thei go home __PUNCT__ thei still believ thei marri __PUNCT__ and in their commun thei repres themselv as be marri __PUNCT__
marriag in on state affect all of the state and therefor we have to have a feder standard that sai marriag in thi countri is a relationship between on man and on woman __PUNCT__
let me just underscor someth i said that came from david landi __PUNCT__ cultur make all the differ __PUNCT__
america is great not just becaus we have wonder river and stream and great geographi or that we have natur resourc __PUNCT__
america is not great becaus we have the best govern __PUNCT__
america is not great becaus we have the best corpor __PUNCT__
without a question america is great becaus we have great peopl __PUNCT__
it is the peopl of america that make it the strongest and most power nation on the planet __PUNCT__
and america peopl ar great becaus we have great parent who made us great __PUNCT__
we have mom and dad and we can learn from their attribut and develop into a great and power societi __PUNCT__ and those attribut ar enhanc enorm by be abl to have such wonder folk that come from both gender and who ar will to sacrific and five to us __PUNCT__
of cours there ar good famili with singl mom that work like crazi to help their children __PUNCT__ but in all case where there a mom and a dad __PUNCT__ a child can learn from the attribut of both __PUNCT__
sometim i get a littl discourag and my friend get a littl discourag if you think about all the challeng __PUNCT__ the jihadist __PUNCT__ the emerg of a new econom power in asia __PUNCT__ the overspend by our govern __PUNCT__ the overus of oil by our economi __PUNCT__ and the extraordinari challeng to our cultur __PUNCT__ everyth from work __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ sacrific __PUNCT__ faith in god __PUNCT__ and famili be the foundat of our societi __PUNCT__
all those thing to a degre ar __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__
be challeng __PUNCT__ but i take some solac in the word of abigail adam __PUNCT__ who wa write a letter to her son dure the revolutionari period and she said __PUNCT__ john __PUNCT__ great necess call out great virtu __PUNCT__
and i seen time and again in thi countri that when the need ar great and peopl step forward __PUNCT__ inaud __PUNCT__ that great virtu come out for the american peopl __PUNCT__
