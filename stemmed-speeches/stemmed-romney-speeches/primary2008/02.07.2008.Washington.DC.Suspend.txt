as i said to you last year __PUNCT__ conserv principl ar need now more than ever __PUNCT__
we face a new gener of challeng __PUNCT__ challeng which threaten our prosper __PUNCT__ our secur and our futur __PUNCT__
i convinc that unless america chang cours __PUNCT__ we could becom the franc of the __NUM__ centuri __PUNCT__
still a great nation __PUNCT__ but not the leader of the world __PUNCT__ not the superpow __PUNCT__
and to me that unthink __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ it wa a while ago shimon pere came to boston for a visit __PUNCT__
he wa ask what he thought about the war in iraq __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ i have to put someth in context __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ america is uniqu in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
in the histori of the world __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ whenev there been conflict __PUNCT__ the nation that win take land from the nation that lose __PUNCT__
on nation in histori __PUNCT__ and thi dure the last centuri __PUNCT__ laid down hundr of thousand of live and took no land __PUNCT__ no land from germani __PUNCT__ no land from korea __PUNCT__ no land from japan __PUNCT__
america __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ is uniqu in the sacrific it ha made for liberti __PUNCT__ for itself and for freedom __PUNCT__ love peopl around the world __PUNCT__
and colin powel ad __PUNCT__ the onli land we took after the last great conflict wa enough land to buri our dead __PUNCT__ the best alli peac ha ever known and will ever know is a strong america __PUNCT__
and that why it is that we have to rise to the occas __PUNCT__ as we alwai done befor __PUNCT__ to confront the challeng that ar ahead of us __PUNCT__
perhap the most fundament of the challeng that we face is the attack on america cultur __PUNCT__
over the year my busi took me to a lot of differ countri __PUNCT__ and i been struck by the enorm differ in the wealth and the well __PUNCT__ be of peopl from differ nation __PUNCT__
i read a number of scholarli explan for the dispar __PUNCT__ and i found the most convinc wa written by a fellow name david land __PUNCT__
he a professor emeritu at harvard univers __PUNCT__
i presum he a liber __PUNCT__
i guess that redund __PUNCT__
and hi work trace the come and go of great civil throughout histori __PUNCT__
and after hundr of page of analysi __PUNCT__ he conclud with thi __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ if we learn anyth from the histori of econom develop it is that cultur make all the differ __PUNCT__ cultur make all the differ __PUNCT__
what is it about america cultur that led us to becom the most power nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ we believ in hard work and educ __PUNCT__
we love opportun __PUNCT__
almost all of us ar immigr or descend of immigr who came here for opportun __PUNCT__
opportun in our dna __PUNCT__
american love god __PUNCT__ and those who don't have faith typic believ in someth greater than themself __PUNCT__ a purpos __PUNCT__ driven life __PUNCT__ if you will __PUNCT__
and we sacrific as american everyth we have __PUNCT__ even our live __PUNCT__ for our famili __PUNCT__ for our freedom and for our countri __PUNCT__
these valu and belief of free american peopl ar the sourc of the nation strength __PUNCT__ and thei alwai will be __PUNCT__
the threat to our cultur come from within __PUNCT__
in the 1960 __PUNCT__ there were welfar program that creat a cultur of poverti in our countri __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ some peopl think we won that battl when we reform welfar __PUNCT__
but the liber haven't given up __PUNCT__
at everi turn __PUNCT__ thei tri to substitut govern largess for individu respons __PUNCT__
thei fight to strip work requir from welfar __PUNCT__ to put more peopl on medicaid __PUNCT__ and remov more and more peopl from have to pai ani incom tax whatsoev __PUNCT__
depend is death to initi __PUNCT__ risk __PUNCT__ take and opportun __PUNCT__
depend is cultur kill __PUNCT__
it a drug __PUNCT__
we got to fight it like the poison it is __PUNCT__
the attack on faith and religion is no less relentless __PUNCT__
and toler for pornographi __PUNCT__ even celebr of it __PUNCT__ and sexual promiscu __PUNCT__ combin with the twist incent of govern welfar __PUNCT__ have led to todai grim realiti __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of african __PUNCT__ american kid born out of wedlock __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of hispan kid __PUNCT__ __NUM__ percent of white kid __PUNCT__
how much harder it is for these kid to succe in school and in life __PUNCT__
a nation built on the principl of the found father cannot long stand when it children ar rais without father in the home __PUNCT__
the develop of a child is enhanc by have a mother and a father __PUNCT__
such a famili is the ideal for the futur of the child and for the strength of the nation __PUNCT__
i wonder how it is that unelect judg __PUNCT__ like some in my state of massachusett __PUNCT__ ar so unawar of thi realiti __PUNCT__ so oblivi to the millennia of record histori __PUNCT__
it time for the peopl of america to fortifi marriag through a constitut amend __PUNCT__ so that liber judg cannot continu to attack it __PUNCT__
europ __PUNCT__ europ is face a demograph disast __PUNCT__
that the inevit product of weaken faith in the creator __PUNCT__ fail famili __PUNCT__ disrespect for the sanctiti of human life __PUNCT__ and erod moral __PUNCT__
some reason that cultur is mere an accessori to america vital __PUNCT__
we know that it the sourc of our strength __PUNCT__
and we will not be dissuad by the snicker and know glanc when we stand up for famili valu and moral and cultur __PUNCT__
we will __PUNCT__
conserv here and conserv across the countri will alwai be honor to stand on principl and to stand for principl __PUNCT__
the attack on our cultur is not the onli a challeng that we face __PUNCT__
we face econom competit unlik anyth we have known befor __PUNCT__
china __PUNCT__ and asia ar emerg from centuri of poverti __PUNCT__
their peopl ar plenti __PUNCT__ innov and ambiti __PUNCT__
if we don't chang cours __PUNCT__ asia or china will pass us by as the econom superpow __PUNCT__ just as we pass england and franc dure the last centuri __PUNCT__
the prosper and secur of our children and grandchildren depend on us __PUNCT__
our prosper and secur also depend on final act to becom energi __PUNCT__ secur __PUNCT__
oil __PUNCT__ produc state like russia and venezuela __PUNCT__ saudi arabia and iran ar siphon over __MONEY__ billion out of our economi __PUNCT__
that almost what we spent annual for our nation defens __PUNCT__
it is past time for us to invest in energi technolog __PUNCT__ nuclear power __PUNCT__ clean coal __PUNCT__ liquid coal __PUNCT__ renew resourc __PUNCT__ energi effici __PUNCT__
simpli put __PUNCT__ america must never be held hostag by the like of putin __PUNCT__ chavez and ahmadinejad __PUNCT__
our economi is also burden by the inexor ramp up of govern spend __PUNCT__
and let be care __PUNCT__ let not just focu on the pork alon __PUNCT__ even though it is inde irrit and shame __PUNCT__
look also at the entitl __PUNCT__
thei make up __NUM__ percent of feder spend todai __PUNCT__
and by the end of the next presid second term thei will total __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
ani conserv plan for the futur ha to includ entitl reform that solv the problem __PUNCT__ not just acknowledg it __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i found that most politician don't seem to understand the connect between our abil to compet and our nation wealth and the wealth of our famili __PUNCT__
thei act as if monei just happen __PUNCT__ that it just happen to be there __PUNCT__
but everi dollar repres a good or servic that been produc in the privat sector __PUNCT__
if you depress the privat sector you depress the well __PUNCT__ be of all american __PUNCT__
that exactli what happen with high tax __PUNCT__ over __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__ tort windfal __PUNCT__ mandat __PUNCT__ and overf __PUNCT__ overspend govern __PUNCT__
did you happen to see __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ that todai govern worker make more monei than peopl who work in the privat sector __PUNCT__ can you imagin what happen to an economi where the best opportun ar for bureaucrat __PUNCT__ it is high time to lower tax __PUNCT__ includ corpor tax __PUNCT__ to take a weed whacker __PUNCT__ get out __PUNCT__ get out that weed whacker and take it to regul and reform entitl and __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ stand up to the increasingli voraci appetit of the union in our govern __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ let consid the greatest challeng face america __PUNCT__ and for that matter face the entir civil world __PUNCT__ the threat of radic __PUNCT__ violent jihad __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ in on wing of the world of islam there a convict that all govern should be destroi and replac by a religi caliph __PUNCT__
these jihadist will battl ani form of democraci becaus to them democraci is blasphem __PUNCT__ becaus it sai that citizen __PUNCT__ not god __PUNCT__ shape the law __PUNCT__
thei find the idea of human equal to be equal offens __PUNCT__
thei hate everyth we believ about freedom just as we hate everyth thei believ about radic jihad __PUNCT__
to battl thi threat __PUNCT__ we sent the most courag and brave soldier in the world __PUNCT__
but their number have been deplet by the clinton year __PUNCT__ when troop were reduc by __NUM__ when almost __NUM__ ship were retir from our navi __PUNCT__ and when our human intellig wa slash by __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
we were told we were get a peac dividend __PUNCT__
we got the dividend __PUNCT__ we didn't get the peac __PUNCT__
in the face of evil and radic jihad __PUNCT__ and given the inevit militari ambit of china __PUNCT__ we must act to rebuild our militari might __PUNCT__ rais militari spend to __NUM__ percent of our gdp __PUNCT__ purchas the most modern armament __PUNCT__ reshap our fight forc for the asymmetr demand we now face __PUNCT__ and give the veteran the care thei deserv __PUNCT__
soon the face of liber in america will have a new name __PUNCT__
whether it barack or hillari __PUNCT__ the result would be the same if thei were to be abl to __PUNCT__
if thei were to be abl to win the presid __PUNCT__
the oppon of american cultur would push the throttl __PUNCT__ devis new justif for judg to depart from the constitut __PUNCT__
and econom neophyt would layer heavier and heavier burden on employ and famili __PUNCT__ slow our economi __PUNCT__ open the wai for foreign competit to further erod our lead __PUNCT__
even though we face an uphil fight __PUNCT__ i know that mani in thi room ar fulli behind my campaign __PUNCT__
you ar with me all the wai to the convent __PUNCT__
fight on __PUNCT__ just like ronald reagan did in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but there is an import differ from __NUM__ __PUNCT__
todai we ar a nation at war __PUNCT__
and barack and hillari have made their intent clear regard iraq and the war on terror __PUNCT__ thei would retreat __PUNCT__ declar defeat __PUNCT__
and the consequ of that would be devast __PUNCT__
it would mean attack on america __PUNCT__ launch from safe haven that would make afghanistan under the taliban look like child plai __PUNCT__
about thi __PUNCT__ i have no doubt __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ i disagre with senat mccain on a number of issu __PUNCT__ as you know __PUNCT__
but i agre with him on do whatev it take to be success in iraq __PUNCT__ and find and execut osama bin laden __PUNCT__
and i agre with him on elimin al qaida and terror worldwid __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ if i fight on __PUNCT__ in my campaign __PUNCT__ all the wai to the convent __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i want you to know __PUNCT__ i given thi a lot of thought __PUNCT__ i forestal the launch of a nation campaign and __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ i make it easier for senat clinton or obama to win __PUNCT__
frankli __PUNCT__ in thi time of war __PUNCT__ i simpli cannot let my campaign be a part of aid a surrend to terror __PUNCT__
thi isn't an easi decis __PUNCT__
i hate to lose __PUNCT__

i fight alongsid you for all the thing we believ in __PUNCT__
and on of the thing we believ in is that we cannot allow the next presid of the unit state to retreat in the face of evil extrem __PUNCT__
it is the common task of each gener and the burden of liberti to preserv thi countri __PUNCT__ expand it freedom and renew it spirit __PUNCT__ so that it nobl past is prologu to it gloriou futur __PUNCT__
to thi task __PUNCT__ accept thi burden __PUNCT__ we all dedic __PUNCT__
