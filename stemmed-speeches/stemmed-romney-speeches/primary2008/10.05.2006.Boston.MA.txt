thank you __PUNCT__ what a group __PUNCT__ welcom to thi histor citi __PUNCT__
and you know that the author of liberti recogn a divin creator who bequeath to us certain inalien right __PUNCT__
thei affirm freedom of religion __PUNCT__ and thei proscrib the establish of ani on religion __PUNCT__
but todai there ar some peopl who ar try to establish on religion __PUNCT__ the religion of secular __PUNCT__
thei not onli reject tradit valu __PUNCT__ thei reject the valu of our founder and thei cast asid the wisdom of the ag __PUNCT__
their alli ar activist judg __PUNCT__ and here in massachusett activist judg struck a blow to the foundat of civil __PUNCT__ the famili __PUNCT__
thei rule that our constitut requir peopl of the same gender to marri __PUNCT__
i believ their error occur becaus thei focus on adult right __PUNCT__
thei said that if heterosexu adult can marri __PUNCT__ then homosexu coupl have to also be abl to marri to have equal right __PUNCT__
but what thei ignor is that marriag is not primarili about adult __PUNCT__
marriag is about the nurtur and develop of children __PUNCT__
a child develop is enhanc by the nurtur of both gender __PUNCT__
everi child deserv a mother and a father __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ the princip burden of thi court rule doesn't fall on adult __PUNCT__ it fall on children __PUNCT__
we ask to chang the state birth certif __PUNCT__
to prevent __PUNCT__ heterocentr __PUNCT__ mother and father would becom __PUNCT__ parent a __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ parent b __PUNCT__
an elementari school teacher read to her second grader from a book titl __PUNCT__ the king and the king __PUNCT__ about a princ who marri a princ __PUNCT__ and a second grader father is deni the right to have hi child taken out of that classroom while the book is be read __PUNCT__
our state most difficult __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ place adopt children mai no longer be place by cathol chariti becaus thei favor home where there a mother and a father __PUNCT__
the price of same __PUNCT__ sex marriag is paid by the children __PUNCT__
our fight for marriag __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ should focu on the need of children __PUNCT__ not the right of adult __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ as american __PUNCT__ i believ that we should show an outpour of respect and toler for all peopl __PUNCT__
i believ god love all of hi children __PUNCT__ that no on is abhor __PUNCT__ that regardless of the differ and differ choic __PUNCT__ we should show that same respect __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we must vigor reject discrimin and bigotri __PUNCT__
massachusett is on the frontlin of marriag __PUNCT__ but unless we adopt a feder amend to protect marriag __PUNCT__ what happen here will unquestion enter everi other state __PUNCT__
thi spread secular religion __PUNCT__ and it substitut valu __PUNCT__ cannot be allow to weaken the foundat of the famili __PUNCT__ or the faith of our father who __PUNCT__ more than life __PUNCT__ their countri love __PUNCT__
