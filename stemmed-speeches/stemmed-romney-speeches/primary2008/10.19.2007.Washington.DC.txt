__PUNCT__ thank you for your warm welcom __PUNCT__
thank you for the work you do to strengthen famili and protect life __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i think those who know me would sai that i am pro __PUNCT__ famili on everi level __PUNCT__ from person to polit __PUNCT__
i know thi __PUNCT__ the greatest bless in my life is ann and our five son and daughter __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ law and ten grandchildren __PUNCT__
my drive motiv is to have our kid and grandkid grow up in an america that is safe __PUNCT__ prosper and strong __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ to achiev that __PUNCT__ it not just what happen in the white hous that matter __PUNCT__ it is also what happen in your hous __PUNCT__
america futur will be determin not just by head of state but also by head of household __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that be said __PUNCT__ there is a good deal that our nation can do to assist and valid parent in their vital role __PUNCT__
as c. __PUNCT__ lewi said __PUNCT__ parenthood is the ultim career __PUNCT__ for which all other exist __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that ring true __PUNCT__ doesn't it __PUNCT__ that mai be becaus of our judeo __PUNCT__ christian heritag __PUNCT__
we have been taught from our youth that marriag is ordain of god and that __PUNCT__ children ar a heritag of the lord __PUNCT__ happi is he who hath hi quiver full of them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ but there is anoth reason __PUNCT__ a societ reason __PUNCT__ for the fundament role of famili __PUNCT__
famili is the build block of the nation __PUNCT__ it is the econom unit of our societi __PUNCT__
thi is not just rhetor __PUNCT__
it is realiti __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ a mother and father who love each other and ar devot to their children will have children that ar better educ __PUNCT__ better adjust __PUNCT__ healthier __PUNCT__ less like to be rais in poverti and less inclin to crime and drug __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ with two parent __PUNCT__ there ar more financi resourc and more time to devot to the next gener __PUNCT__ and there is someon around to take over when on parent is at their wit end with the kid __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ famili also mean that there is a compassion caregiv when the inevit sick or infirm strike a famili member __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and when you consid the sourc of most of societi social problem __PUNCT__ from teenag pregnanc to drug us to crime __PUNCT__ you will find that thei stem from the breakdown of the famili __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ for all these reason __PUNCT__ a societi is wealthier __PUNCT__ healthier and stronger when it ha strong famili __PUNCT__
in america __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ the famili is a vital econom unit __PUNCT__ the foundat of our nation __PUNCT__
and it is the strength of thi nation famili that ultim determin america strength in the famili of nation __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ that is why i believ that the most import work for the futur of america is the work that goe on within the four wall of the american home __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ not all famili will have two love parent __PUNCT__
there ar mani great singl parent __PUNCT__ like my sister jane __PUNCT__ who rais four wonder children on her own __PUNCT__
so not alwai __PUNCT__ but in the vast number of an entir nation __PUNCT__ two parent ar the ideal set for rais a child __PUNCT__ and for form the econom unit of societi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i certainli don't need to tell the famili research council and focu on the famili that the american famili is under stress __PUNCT__ and under attack __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ on of the biggest threat to the fabric of our societi is out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ wedlock childbirth __PUNCT__
ann and i will us the bulli pulpit to teach america children that befor thei have babi __PUNCT__ thei should get marri __PUNCT__
it time to make out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ wedlock birth out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ fashion again __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in __NUM__ a research name daniel patrick moynihan wa troubl by an alarm statist __PUNCT__ approxim __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of african __PUNCT__ american children were born out of wedlock __PUNCT__
how would thei escap poverti __PUNCT__ todai __PUNCT__ not __NUM__ __PUNCT__ but __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of african __PUNCT__ american children ar born out of wedlock __PUNCT__
bill cosbi relat that in some inner citi __PUNCT__ there ar whole block with scarc a marri coupl __PUNCT__ whole block without respons male to watch out for wayward boi __PUNCT__ whole neighborhood in which littl boi and girl come of ag without see up close a commit relationship and perhap never have attend a wed __PUNCT__ thi simpli break my heart __PUNCT__
and then there ar the broad nation implic of thi tragedi __PUNCT__
a nation built on the principl of the found father cannot thrive when so mani children ar be rais without father in the home __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ ann taught a class of at __PUNCT__ risk girl at mother carolin academi in boston __PUNCT__
on dai she ask her __NUM__ grader how mani of them want to go to colleg __PUNCT__
almost everi hand went up __PUNCT__
then she ask how mani were plan on have a babi befor thei graduat from high school __PUNCT__ almost everi hand went up again __PUNCT__
and then she told them the truth __PUNCT__ you just won't be abl to do both __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ everi first ladi champion a caus __PUNCT__
for nanci reagan __PUNCT__ it wa to just sai no to drug __PUNCT__
for barbara and laura bush __PUNCT__ it ha been read __PUNCT__
ann ha work to help children make good choic like marriag and high school befor have babi __PUNCT__
if she is first ladi __PUNCT__ thi will be her mission __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and if i am elect presid __PUNCT__ i will conven a white hous summit to look at wai we can strengthen the famili __PUNCT__ particularli in the inner citi __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in addit to us the bulli pulpit __PUNCT__ there ar specif polici initi that i like to bring forward __PUNCT__ as well as some goal we can set to accomplish togeth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i will re __PUNCT__ align govern incent to encourag marriag __PUNCT__ not penal it __PUNCT__
as we all know __PUNCT__ few thing had as devast an impact on poor famili as the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ s welfar system __PUNCT__
to some degre __PUNCT__ that ha been reform __PUNCT__ but there is more work to do __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ a singl mother with child care who marri the father of her child can lose as much as __MONEY__ a year in govern benefit __PUNCT__
their combin incom can disqualifi them for medicaid __PUNCT__ hous voucher __PUNCT__ food stamp and welfar __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it is time that we made father respons for their child health and care __PUNCT__ whether or not thei have marri the mother __PUNCT__
and further __PUNCT__ the tax penalti we attach to marri coupl is simpli offens __PUNCT__
the word __PUNCT__ i do __PUNCT__ in marriag should not result in the govern sai __PUNCT__ you don't __PUNCT__ when it come to the econom secur of a famili __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ some year ago __PUNCT__ dr __PUNCT__ dobson met with presid reagan to determin how thei could keep govern from do thing that hurt famili and that weaken the famili structur in america __PUNCT__
thi meet led the presid to issu an execut order which establish the requir that new govern polici and program be subject to a famili impact statement __PUNCT__
and then year later __PUNCT__ without fanfar or reason __PUNCT__ bill clinton simpli snuf it out __PUNCT__
if i becom presid __PUNCT__ i will re __PUNCT__ instat the famili impact statement __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ in addit __PUNCT__ i will initi an audit of all current program and polici which neg impact famili __PUNCT__
and i will look to support the right of parent who ar not alwai consult about decis affect their children __PUNCT__
there is someth wrong when a school can tell a parent that thei have no right to remov their second grader from a class where thei ar teach about same __PUNCT__ sex marriag __PUNCT__
the work of be a parent is hard enough without the govern make it harder __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i will work with the peopl in thi room __PUNCT__ as i have for the past four year __PUNCT__ to champion a feder marriag amend to protect marriag as the union of a man and a woman __PUNCT__
within month of take offic as governor __PUNCT__ the massachusett suprem judici court got the gai marriag ball roll __PUNCT__
thei said it wa in our state constitut __PUNCT__
john adam __PUNCT__ who wrote it __PUNCT__ would be surpris __PUNCT__
it wa not in our constitut __PUNCT__ but it wa in the head of a on vote major on the bench to birth new law without the benefit of democraci __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the court error i believ wa that it focus on adult right __PUNCT__ if heterosexu coupl can marri __PUNCT__ it reason __PUNCT__ then to have equal right __PUNCT__ homosexu coupl should also be abl to marri __PUNCT__
but thei forgot that on of the primari purpos of marriag is the develop and nurtur of children __PUNCT__
everi child deserv a mother and a father __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ the court opinion is as astonish as it rule __PUNCT__
it said that tradit marriag between a man and a woman __PUNCT__ work a deep and scar hardship __PUNCT__ for no ration reason __PUNCT__ no ration reason __PUNCT__ how about the strength and preserv of our civil __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and thi is no longer just a massachusett issu __PUNCT__
as recent as a few month ago __PUNCT__ a judg in iowa said that gai coupl have the right to marri becaus current marriag law __PUNCT__ oper onli to harm same sex coupl and their children __PUNCT__ astonish __PUNCT__

i wrote everi republican u. __PUNCT__ senat to support it __PUNCT__
