it run by peopl who don't understand the word __PUNCT__ global competit of idea __PUNCT__ and our idea ha to win __PUNCT__ but onli if america reign strong __PUNCT__
but with that introduct __PUNCT__ i go to turn to you for counsel __PUNCT__ advic __PUNCT__ or question __PUNCT__
polici question __PUNCT__
wanna talk about tax polici __PUNCT__ or polit question __PUNCT__ how i win __PUNCT__ pleas __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__ it interest __PUNCT__ the former head of goldman sach __PUNCT__ john whitehead __PUNCT__ wa also the former head of the new york feder reserv __PUNCT__
and i met with him __PUNCT__ and he said as soon as the fed stop bui all the debt that we issu __PUNCT__ which thei been do __PUNCT__ the fed bui like three __PUNCT__ quarter of the debt that america issu __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ onc that over __PUNCT__ he said we go to have a fail treasuri auction __PUNCT__ interest rate ar go to have to go up __PUNCT__
we live in thi borrow fantasi world __PUNCT__ where the govern keep on borrow monei __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ we borrow thi extra trillion a year __PUNCT__ we wonder who loan us the trillion __PUNCT__ the chines aren't loan us anymor __PUNCT__
the russian aren't loan it to us anymor __PUNCT__
so who give us the trillion __PUNCT__ and the answer is we just make it up __PUNCT__
the feder reserv is just take it and sai __PUNCT__ here __PUNCT__ we give it __PUNCT__
it just made up monei __PUNCT__ and thi doe not augur well for our econom futur __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ some of these thing ar complex enough it not easi for peopl to understand __PUNCT__ but your point of sai __PUNCT__ bankruptci usual concentr the mind __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__ georg __PUNCT__
by and larg peopl don't get it __PUNCT__
peopl in our parti __PUNCT__ and part of __PUNCT__ it our fault becaus we been talk about deficit and debt for about __NUM__ or __NUM__ year as a parti __PUNCT__ and so thei heard us sai it and sai it and sai it __PUNCT__
the fact that greec is go what it go through __PUNCT__ and thei read about franc and itali and spain __PUNCT__ ha final made thi issu topic for the american peopl __PUNCT__
and so when you do poll __PUNCT__ and you ask peopl what is the biggest issu in the __NUM__ elect __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ __NUM__ is the economi and job by a wide margin __PUNCT__
but no __PUNCT__ __NUM__ is the deficit __PUNCT__
but debt __PUNCT__ that doesn't calcul for folk __PUNCT__ but the deficit doe __PUNCT__
thei recogn you can't go on forev like thi __PUNCT__
although the peopl who recogn that tend to be republican __PUNCT__ and the peopl who don't recogn that tend to be democrat __PUNCT__
and what we have to get is that __NUM__ or __NUM__ percent in the middl who sometim vote republican __PUNCT__ sometim vote democrat __PUNCT__ and have them understand how import thi is __PUNCT__
it a challeng __PUNCT__
i did the calcul for folk todai __PUNCT__ and usa todai publish thi everi year __PUNCT__
it a front __PUNCT__ page stori __PUNCT__ the headlin onc a year __PUNCT__ it somehow escap peopl attent __PUNCT__ and that is __PUNCT__ if you take the total nation debt and the unfund liabil of medicar __PUNCT__ social secur __PUNCT__ and medicaid __PUNCT__ the amount of debt plu unfund liabil per household in america is __MONEY__
per household __PUNCT__
at least __PUNCT__
__NUM__ time their incom __PUNCT__
even though we not go to be write the check for that amount per household __PUNCT__ thei go to be pai the interest on that __PUNCT__
you be pai the interest on that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ audienc laugh __PUNCT__
becaus we __PUNCT__ my gener will be long gone __PUNCT__ and you be pai the interest __PUNCT__
and so you be pai tax __PUNCT__ not onli for the thing you want in your gener __PUNCT__ but for all the thing we spent monei on __PUNCT__ which is just __PUNCT__ it extraordinari to think the tax rate __PUNCT__ someon calcul what would happen __PUNCT__
if we don't chang medicar or social secur __PUNCT__ the tax rate __PUNCT__ you know what the payrol tax is now __PUNCT__ it __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ if we don't chang those program __PUNCT__ that tax rate will have to ultim rise to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the payrol tax __PUNCT__
then there the incom tax on top __PUNCT__ which the presid want to take to __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
then there state tax in most state __PUNCT__
and sale tax __PUNCT__
so you end up have to take __NUM__ percent of peopl incom __PUNCT__
and yet the presid __PUNCT__ three and a half year in __PUNCT__ won't talk about reform social secur or medicar __PUNCT__
and when the republican do __PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ oh __PUNCT__ you throw granni off the cliff __PUNCT__
it like you kill the kid __PUNCT__
the biggest surpris that i have is that young peopl will vote for democrat __PUNCT__
thei look at thi and sai __PUNCT__ holi cow __PUNCT__ the onli gui who ar worri about the futur of our countri and our futur ar republican __PUNCT__
but the democrat __PUNCT__ thei talk about social issu __PUNCT__ draw in the young peopl __PUNCT__ and thei vote on that issu __PUNCT__
it like __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ there won't be ani hous like thi if we stai on the road we on __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ start eat __PUNCT__ those of you who have food in front of you that warm __PUNCT__ start eat __PUNCT__
i stand up so i can see you __PUNCT__ but i not stand up so you that you have to stop and look at me __PUNCT__
it import to look at your food as you eat it __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ audienc laugh __PUNCT__
notic you put a fork in your finger here __PUNCT__ all right __PUNCT__ cross talk __PUNCT__ laughter __PUNCT__
you ar right __PUNCT__ which is a nuclear iran is an unthink outcom __PUNCT__ not just for our friend in israel and our friend in europ __PUNCT__ but also for us __PUNCT__
becaus iran is the state sponsor of terror in the world __PUNCT__ ha hezbollah now throughout latin america __PUNCT__ hezbollah with fissil materi __PUNCT__
if i were iran __PUNCT__ and a craze fanat __PUNCT__ i sai let get a littl fissil materi to hezbollah __PUNCT__ have them carri it to chicago or some other place __PUNCT__ and then if anyth goe wrong or if america start act up __PUNCT__ we just sai __PUNCT__ guess what __PUNCT__ unless you stand down __PUNCT__ why we gonna let off a dirti bomb __PUNCT__
thi is where we head __PUNCT__ where american can be held up and blackmail by iran __PUNCT__ by the mullah __PUNCT__ by crazi peopl __PUNCT__
so we realli don't have ani option but to keep iran from have a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
i give the specif about iran __PUNCT__ and then mayb talk more broadli about foreign polici __PUNCT__
the specif on iran is that we should have put in place crippl sanction at the begin of the presid term __PUNCT__
we did not __PUNCT__
he will sai __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ but russian wouldn't go along with us __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he gave russia their no __PUNCT__ __NUM__ foreign object __PUNCT__ for a decad __PUNCT__ all thei care about is get the missil defens site out of poland __PUNCT__ and he gave them that and got noth in return __PUNCT__
he could have __PUNCT__ i presum __PUNCT__ gotten them to agre to crippl sanction on iran __PUNCT__
he did not __PUNCT__ which is in my opinion __PUNCT__ on of the greatest foreign polici error of the modern time __PUNCT__
and by the wai __PUNCT__ if he could not have gotten that from russia __PUNCT__ he should have kept the missil defens site in poland __PUNCT__ just to keep a bargain chip on tabl __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ put noth in if he want __PUNCT__ i would have kept them __PUNCT__ i wouldn't have trade them awai __PUNCT__ but that where he wa __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__
__NUM__ we should have been aggress support the voic of dissent in iran __PUNCT__ and when there wa an effort toward revolut there we should been aggress support __PUNCT__
and final we should have made it clear __PUNCT__ at least by now __PUNCT__ that we have militari plan to potenti remov their nuclear capabl __PUNCT__
that doesn't mean we actual pull the trigger __PUNCT__ but it mean we commun to them that we readi to do so __PUNCT__
and that it is unaccept to america to have a nuclear iran __PUNCT__
instead what thi administr ha done is commun to the iranian that we more worri about israel attack them than we ar about them becom nuclear __PUNCT__
it extraordinari __PUNCT__
so those ar some thought directli at iran __PUNCT__
i step back on foreign polici __PUNCT__ the presid foreign polici __PUNCT__ in my opinion __PUNCT__ is form in part by a percept that he ha that hi magnet and hi charm and hi persuas is so compel that he can sit down with peopl like putin __PUNCT__ chávez __PUNCT__ and ahmadinejad __PUNCT__
and that thei find we such wonder peopl that thei go on with us __PUNCT__
and thei stop do bad thing __PUNCT__
and it an extraordinarili naiv percept __PUNCT__ and it ha led to huge error in north korea __PUNCT__ in iraq __PUNCT__ obvious in iran __PUNCT__ in egypt __PUNCT__ around the world __PUNCT__
my own view is that that the centerpiec of american foreign polici ha to be strength __PUNCT__
everyth i do will be calcul to increas america strength __PUNCT__
when you stand by your alli __PUNCT__ you increas your strength __PUNCT__
when you attack your alli __PUNCT__ you becom weaker __PUNCT__
when you stand by your principl __PUNCT__ you get stronger __PUNCT__
when you have a big militari __PUNCT__ that bigger than anyon els __PUNCT__ you stronger __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__
when you have a strong economi __PUNCT__ you build america strength __PUNCT__
for me __PUNCT__ everyth is about strength and commun to peopl what is and is not accept __PUNCT__
it speak softli but carri a veri __PUNCT__ veri __PUNCT__ veri big stick __PUNCT__
and thi presid instead speak loudli and carri a tini stick __PUNCT__
and that is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ that not the right cours for a foreign polici __PUNCT__
i saw dr __PUNCT__ kissing in new york __PUNCT__ you not eat __PUNCT__ he bore to tear __PUNCT__
i saw dr __PUNCT__ kissing __PUNCT__ i said to him __PUNCT__ how ar we perceiv around the world __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ on word __PUNCT__ veak __PUNCT__ audienc laugh __PUNCT__
we ar weak __PUNCT__ and that how thi presid is perceiv __PUNCT__ by our friend and __PUNCT__ unfortun __PUNCT__ by our foe __PUNCT__
and it no wonder that peopl like kim jong un __PUNCT__ the new leader of north korea __PUNCT__ announc a long __PUNCT__ rang missil test onli a week after he said he wouldn't __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ it like __PUNCT__ what thi presid go to do about it __PUNCT__ if you can't act __PUNCT__ why __PUNCT__ don't threaten __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ to anoth audienc member with a question __PUNCT__ pleas __PUNCT__
i just gonna tast thi by the wai __PUNCT__
i just wanna show you how it done __PUNCT__ you take thi in your fork __PUNCT__ you put it in __PUNCT__ that good __PUNCT__ that good __PUNCT__
pleas __PUNCT__ go ahead __PUNCT__
i appreci the idea __PUNCT__
i can't __PUNCT__ on of the other thing that frustrat to me is that at a typic dai like thi __PUNCT__ when i do three or four event like thi __PUNCT__ the number of foreign polici question that i get ar between zero and on __PUNCT__
and the american peopl ar not concentr at all on china __PUNCT__ on russia __PUNCT__ iran __PUNCT__ iraq __PUNCT__
thi presid failur to put in place a statu forc agreement allow __NUM__ troop to stai in iraq __PUNCT__ unthink __PUNCT__ and yet __PUNCT__ in that elect __PUNCT__ in the jimmi carter elect __PUNCT__ the fact that we have hostag in iran __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ that wa all we talk about __PUNCT__
and we had the two helicopt crash in the desert __PUNCT__ i mean that __PUNCT__ that wa __PUNCT__ that wa the focu __PUNCT__ and so him solv that made all the differ in the world __PUNCT__
i afraid todai if you said __PUNCT__ we got iran to agre to stand down a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ thei go hold on __PUNCT__
it realli a __PUNCT__ but __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ if someth of that natur present itself __PUNCT__ i will work to find a wai to take advantag of the opportun __PUNCT__
i torn by two perspect in thi regard __PUNCT__
on is the on which i had for some time __PUNCT__ which is that the palestinian have no interest whatsoev in establish peac __PUNCT__
and that the pathwai to peac is almost unthink to accomplish __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ why do i sai that __PUNCT__ some might sai well just let the palestinian have the west bank and have secur and set up a separ nation for the palestinian __PUNCT__
and then come a coupl of thorni question __PUNCT__
and i don't have a map here to look at the geographi __PUNCT__
but the border between israel and the west bank is obvious right there __PUNCT__ right next to tel aviv __PUNCT__ which is the financi capit __PUNCT__ the industri capit of israel __PUNCT__
the center of israel __PUNCT__
it __PUNCT__ uh __PUNCT__ what __PUNCT__ the border would be mayb seven mile from tel aviv to what would be the west bank __PUNCT__
nine mile __PUNCT__
okai __PUNCT__ i be close __PUNCT__
nine mile __PUNCT__
the challeng is the other side of the west bank __PUNCT__ the other side of the west bank __PUNCT__ the other side of what would be thi new palestinian state would either be syria at on point or jordan __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ the iranian would want to do through the west bank exactli what thei did through lebanon and what thei did in gaza __PUNCT__
which is the iranian would want to bring missil and armament into the west bank and potenti threaten israel __PUNCT__
so israel __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ would have to sai that can't happen __PUNCT__
we got to keep the iranian from bring weaponri into the west bank __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ that mean that __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ the isra ar go to control the border between jordan __PUNCT__ syria __PUNCT__ and thi new palestinian nation __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the palestinian would sai __PUNCT__ ah __PUNCT__ no wai __PUNCT__ we an independ countri __PUNCT__
you can't guard our border with other arab nation __PUNCT__
and then how about the airport __PUNCT__ how about fly into thi palestinian nation __PUNCT__ ar we go to allow militari aircraft to come in __PUNCT__ and weaponri to come in __PUNCT__ and if not __PUNCT__ who go to keep it from come in __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ the isra __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the palestinian ar go to sai __PUNCT__ we not an independ nation if israel is abl to come in and tell us what can land at our airport __PUNCT__
these ar problem __PUNCT__ and thei veri hard to solv __PUNCT__ alright __PUNCT__
and i look at the palestinian not want to see peac anywai __PUNCT__ for polit purpos __PUNCT__ commit to the destruct and elimin of israel __PUNCT__ and these thorni issu __PUNCT__ and i sai there just no wai __PUNCT__
and so what you do is you sai you move thing along the best wai you can __PUNCT__
you hope for some degre of stabil __PUNCT__ but you recogn that it go to remain an unsolv problem __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ we look at that in china and taiwan __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ we have a potenti volatil situat __PUNCT__ but we sort of live with it __PUNCT__
and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultim __PUNCT__ somehow __PUNCT__ someth will happen and resolv __PUNCT__
we don't go to war to try and resolv it __PUNCT__
on the other hand __PUNCT__ i got a call from a former secretari of state __PUNCT__ and i won't mention which on it wa __PUNCT__ but thi individu said to me __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ i think there a prospect for a settlement between the palestinian and the isra after the palestinian elect __PUNCT__
i said __PUNCT__ realli __PUNCT__ and hi answer wa __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i think there some prospect __PUNCT__
and i didn't delv into it but you know __PUNCT__ i alwai keep open the idea of __PUNCT__ i have to tell ya __PUNCT__ the idea of push on the isra __PUNCT__ to give someth up __PUNCT__ to get the palestinian to act __PUNCT__ is the worst idea in the world __PUNCT__
we have done that time and time and time again __PUNCT__
it doe not work __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ the onli answer is show your strength __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ american strength __PUNCT__ american resolv __PUNCT__ as the palestinian somedai reach the point where thei want peac more than we try to push peac on them __PUNCT__ and then it worth have the discuss __PUNCT__
until then __PUNCT__ it just wish think __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ audienc crosstalk __PUNCT__
i have __PUNCT__ i have some good new for you __PUNCT__
it not imposs __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the reason i sai that is for instanc __PUNCT__ the new york time had a poll last week __PUNCT__ the new york time and nbc __PUNCT__ and i wa lead by two point among women __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ the presid came out and said thi is an outrag poll __PUNCT__ thei don't know what thei were do __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__ the poll at thi stage make no differ at all __PUNCT__ but the point is __PUNCT__ women ar open to support me __PUNCT__
thei like the presid __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ but thei disappoint __PUNCT__
thei disappoint with the job thei see for their kid __PUNCT__ thei disappoint with their own econom stand right now __PUNCT__
so we can captur women vote __PUNCT__ we have a much harder time with hispan voter __PUNCT__
and if the hispan vote bloc becom as commit to the democrat as the african american vote bloc ha in the past __PUNCT__ why we in troubl as a parti and __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ as a nation __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ we have some great __PUNCT__ we have some great hispan leader in our parti who will help commun what our parti stand for __PUNCT__ and what i think __PUNCT__ frankli __PUNCT__ what i need you to do is to rais million of dollar __PUNCT__ becaus the presid go to have about __MONEY__ to __MONEY__ million __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ that by far the most import thing you could do __PUNCT__
becaus __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ becaus you don't have the capac to speak to hundr of thousand of peopl __PUNCT__
i will be in those debat __PUNCT__
it will be __PUNCT__ i don't know __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million american watch __PUNCT__
if i do well __PUNCT__ it help __PUNCT__
if i don't __PUNCT__ it won't help __PUNCT__
but advertis make a differ __PUNCT__ and the presid will engag in a person charact assassin campaign __PUNCT__
and so we have to fire back on __PUNCT__ in defens __PUNCT__ and no __PUNCT__
__NUM__ in offens __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ florida will be on of those state that is the kei state __PUNCT__
and so all the monei will get spent in __NUM__ state __PUNCT__ and thi is on of them __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ the best thing i could ask you to do __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ sure __PUNCT__ talk to peopl and tell them how you know me and word of mouth make a big differ __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ i not terribl well known by the gener american public __PUNCT__ becaus __PUNCT__
thei don't __PUNCT__
but don't worri __PUNCT__ given all those neg thing __PUNCT__ given all those neg thing __PUNCT__ the fact that i either ti or close to the presid __PUNCT__ and the fact that __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ he out there talk about the on __PUNCT__ year anniversari of osama bin laden be captur __PUNCT__ unemploy come down __PUNCT__ unleash hi campaign __PUNCT__ new campaign __PUNCT__ and we still sort of ti __PUNCT__ that veri interest __PUNCT__
and it __PUNCT__ it encourag __PUNCT__
pleas __PUNCT__
in everi stump speech i give __PUNCT__ i speak about the fact that peopl who dream and achiev enorm success do not make us poorer __PUNCT__ thei make us better off __PUNCT__
and the republican audienc that i typic speak to applaud __PUNCT__
i said that tonight __PUNCT__ and the media there __PUNCT__ and thei write about it __PUNCT__ thei sai that romnei defend success in america and dreamer and so forth __PUNCT__
so thei write about it __PUNCT__
but in term of what get through to the american conscious __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ i have veri littl influenc on that in thi stage __PUNCT__ as to what thei write about __PUNCT__
and that will happen __PUNCT__ and we have three debat __PUNCT__ we have a chanc to talk about that in the debat __PUNCT__
there will be ad which attack me __PUNCT__ i will fire back in a wai that describ in the best wai we can the fact that if __PUNCT__ the theme in my speech is that __PUNCT__ i wind up in __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the ambassador __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ me todai __PUNCT__ sever time __PUNCT__ i wind up talk about how the thing which i find most disappoint in thi presid is hi attack of on american against anoth american __PUNCT__ the divis of america base on go after those who have been success __PUNCT__
and then i quot marco rubio __PUNCT__ i tell in my speech __PUNCT__ i sai __PUNCT__ marco rubio __PUNCT__ i think what i said would be __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ i also think i said that at a fundrais event earlier todai __PUNCT__ but i did when i wa in empir __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ audienc laugh __PUNCT__ i just said sen __PUNCT__ rubio sai that when he grew up here __PUNCT__ poor __PUNCT__ that thei look at peopl that had a lot of wealth __PUNCT__ and hi parent never onc said __PUNCT__ we need some of what thei have __PUNCT__ thei should give us some __PUNCT__
instead thei said that you work hard and go to school __PUNCT__ somedai we might be abl to have enough __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__
i will continu to do that __PUNCT__ how much of that get pick up __PUNCT__ there ar so mani thing that don't get pick up in a campaign becaus peopl aren't watch them __PUNCT__
by the wai __PUNCT__ most peopl don't watch dure the summer __PUNCT__
i said we go to go into a season here start with the begin of __DATE__ with almost no attent paid __PUNCT__ then after labor dai __PUNCT__ in __DATE__ and __DATE__ __PUNCT__ that when it get __URL__ ar __NUM__ percent of the peopl who will vote for the presid no matter what __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ there ar __NUM__ percent who ar with him __PUNCT__ who ar depend upon govern __PUNCT__ who believ that thei ar victim __PUNCT__ who believ that govern ha a respons to care for them __PUNCT__ who believ that thei ar entitl to health care __PUNCT__ to food __PUNCT__ to hous __PUNCT__ to you name it __PUNCT__
that that an entitl __PUNCT__
and the govern should give it to them __PUNCT__
and thei will vote for thi presid no matter what __PUNCT__
and i mean __PUNCT__ the presid start off with __NUM__ __PUNCT__ he start off with a huge number __PUNCT__
these ar peopl who pai no incom tax __PUNCT__
forti __PUNCT__ seven percent of american pai no incom tax __PUNCT__
so our messag of low tax doesn't connect __PUNCT__
and he be out there talk about tax cut for the rich __PUNCT__
i mean that what thei sell everi four year __PUNCT__
and so my job is not to worri about those peopl __PUNCT__ i never convinc them that thei should take person respons and care for their live __PUNCT__
what i have to do is convinc the __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent in the center that ar independ that ar thought __PUNCT__ that look at vote on wai or the other depend upon in some case emot __PUNCT__ whether thei like the gui or not __PUNCT__ what it look like __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ when you ask those peopl __PUNCT__ we do all these poll __PUNCT__ i find it amaz __PUNCT__ we poll all these peopl __PUNCT__ see where you stand on the poll __PUNCT__ but __NUM__ percent of the peopl will go with a republican __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ or __NUM__ __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ and about twice as much as china __PUNCT__ not __NUM__ time as much like it report __PUNCT__
and we have respons for the whole world __PUNCT__
thei onli focus on on littl area of the world __PUNCT__ the south china sea __PUNCT__ the east china sea __PUNCT__ that it __PUNCT__
and thei build a militari at a rapid rate __PUNCT__
so thi idea that somehow we alreadi spent so much monei in the militari __PUNCT__ it like __PUNCT__ gui __PUNCT__ don't overthink how strong we ar __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ you probabl know it __PUNCT__ thi wa a coupl of year ago __PUNCT__ but we had on of our aircraft carrier sail by japan __PUNCT__ and the chines pull up behind it in a diesel sub __PUNCT__ in a super __PUNCT__ quiet diesel sub __PUNCT__ pull up behind it __PUNCT__
it could have been torpedo __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ i mean __PUNCT__ we in that kind of __PUNCT__ our navi smaller in number of ship than anytim sinc __NUM__ and thi presid want to shrink it __PUNCT__
the list goe on __PUNCT__
our air forc is older and smaller than anytim sinc __PUNCT__ __NUM__ when the air forc wa form __PUNCT__ and he want to shrink it __PUNCT__
if we go the wai of europ __PUNCT__ which is spend __NUM__ to __NUM__ percent of their economi on the militari __PUNCT__ we will not be abl to have freedom in the world __PUNCT__
taxageddon __PUNCT__
thei probabl be look at what the poll ar sai __PUNCT__
if it look like i go to win __PUNCT__ the market will be happi __PUNCT__
if it look like the presid go to win __PUNCT__ the market should not be terribl happi __PUNCT__
it depend __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ which market you talk about __PUNCT__ which type of commod and so forth __PUNCT__ but my own view is __PUNCT__ if we win on __DATE__ there will be a great deal of optim about the futur of thi countri __PUNCT__
we see capit come back __PUNCT__ and we see __PUNCT__ without actual do anyth __PUNCT__ we actual get a boost in the economi __PUNCT__
if the presid get reelect __PUNCT__ i don't know what will happen __PUNCT__
i can never predict what the market will do __PUNCT__
sometim it doe the exact opposit of what i would have expect __PUNCT__
but my own view is that if we get the __PUNCT__ the __PUNCT__ taxageddon __PUNCT__ as thei call it __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ with thi presid __PUNCT__ and with a congress that can't work togeth __PUNCT__ it realli is frighten __PUNCT__ realli frighten in my view __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ i wrote a book that lai out my view for what ha to happen in the countri __PUNCT__
and peopl who ar fascin by polici will read the book __PUNCT__
we have a websit that lai out white paper on a whole seri of issu that i care about __PUNCT__
i have to tell you __PUNCT__ i don't think thi will have a signific impact on my elect __PUNCT__
um __PUNCT__ i wish it did __PUNCT__
i think our ad will have a much bigger impact __PUNCT__
i think the debat will have a big impact __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__
but that my point __PUNCT__
which is __PUNCT__ my dad us to sai __PUNCT__ be right earli is not good in polit __PUNCT__
and in a set like thi __PUNCT__ a highli intellectu subject __PUNCT__ a discuss of a whole seri of import topic __PUNCT__ typic doesn't win elect __PUNCT__
and there ar __PUNCT__ for instanc __PUNCT__ thi presid won becaus of hope and chang __PUNCT__
all right __PUNCT__ he won becaus of hope and chang __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__
so it __PUNCT__ i can tell you i have a veri good team of extraordinarili experienc __PUNCT__ highli success consult __PUNCT__
a coupl of peopl in particular who done race around the world __PUNCT__
i didn't realiz these gui in the us __PUNCT__ the karl rove equival __PUNCT__ thei do race all over the world __PUNCT__
in armenia __PUNCT__
in africa __PUNCT__
in israel __PUNCT__
i mean __PUNCT__ thei work for bibi netanyahu in hi race __PUNCT__
so thei do hi race and see which ad work and which process work best and __PUNCT__ uh __PUNCT__ we have idea about what we do over the cours of the campaign __PUNCT__
i tell them to you __PUNCT__ but i have to __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ shoot ya __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ audienc laugh __PUNCT__
hopefulli it will be a success place __PUNCT__
i think on of the aspect about hope and chang that work well for obama four year ago wa he promis to bring us more honest __PUNCT__ transpar govern in washington __PUNCT__
i been around polit __PUNCT__ the first campaign i work for wa barri goldwat in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i gotta be the oldest republican in __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__
but from what i seen __PUNCT__ particularli in the last seven month becaus of my own person involv in an issu __PUNCT__ is the govern in washington right now is just permeat by cronyism __PUNCT__ outright corrupt __PUNCT__
our regulatori agenc that ar suppos to protect the public ar protect the peopl that thei suppos to be regul __PUNCT__
and i think peopl ar fed up with that __PUNCT__
doesn't matter if you in the tea parti of occupi wall street __PUNCT__ peopl see that the govern is work for the power interest and the peopl who well __PUNCT__ connect polit and not the common person __PUNCT__
which threaten that whole idea that we have thi great opportun __PUNCT__ which we should have and have had __PUNCT__ histor __PUNCT__ in the us for anybodi __PUNCT__ from whatev background __PUNCT__ to becom success __PUNCT__
on wai that that becom compromis is when the govern is no longer seen as be an honest agent __PUNCT__
and where our tax dollar ar not realli be put to work for us but for the peopl who ar plug __PUNCT__ in polit __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ you had case like solyndra and __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ that i talk about and gotten involv in __PUNCT__
you have eric holder who is probabl the most corrupt attornei gener that we had ever in american histori __PUNCT__
and i think it someth that if spun the right wai in simpl term can actual reson with the american peopl __PUNCT__
obama did not keep hi promis __PUNCT__
nanci pelosi wa suppos to give us an honest congress and ha given us just the opposit as speaker __PUNCT__
and i think that a campaign issu that can work well __PUNCT__
i optimist that you be elect presid __PUNCT__
and my recommend would be clean hous __PUNCT__ immedi __PUNCT__
the sec __PUNCT__ the cfec ar disast area __PUNCT__
i wish thei weren't union __PUNCT__ so we could go a lot deeper than you actual allow to go __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__
i can sai thi __PUNCT__ which i sure you agre with thi as well __PUNCT__
we speak with voter across the countri about their percept __PUNCT__
those peopl i told you __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ to __NUM__ or __NUM__ percent that we have to bring onto our side __PUNCT__ thei all vote for barack obama four year ago __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ and by the wai __PUNCT__ when you sai to them __PUNCT__ do you think barack obama is a failur __PUNCT__ thei overwhelmingli sai no __PUNCT__
thei like him __PUNCT__
but when you sai __PUNCT__ ar you disappoint in hi polici that haven't work __PUNCT__ thei sai ye __PUNCT__
and becaus thei vote for him __PUNCT__ thei don't want to be told that thei were wrong __PUNCT__ that he a bad gui __PUNCT__ that he did bad thing __PUNCT__ that he corrupt __PUNCT__
those peopl that we that have to get __PUNCT__ thei want to think thei did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task __PUNCT__
thei love the phrase __PUNCT__ he in over hi head __PUNCT__
but we __PUNCT__ you see __PUNCT__ you and i __PUNCT__ we spend our dai with republican __PUNCT__
we spend our dai with peopl who agre with us __PUNCT__ and these peopl ar peopl who vote for him and don't agre with us __PUNCT__
and so the thing that anim us ar not the thing that anim them __PUNCT__
and the best success i have speak with those peopl is __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ the presid been a disappoint __PUNCT__
he told you he keep unemploy below __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ hasn't been below __NUM__ percent sinc __PUNCT__
fifti percent of kid come out of school can't get a job __PUNCT__
fifti percent __PUNCT__
fifti percent of the kid in high school in our __NUM__ largest citi won't graduat from high school __PUNCT__
what ar thei gonna do __PUNCT__ thei usual pass on sai __PUNCT__ and i could sai to that audienc that thei nod their head and sai __PUNCT__ yeah __PUNCT__ i think you right __PUNCT__
what he go to do by the wai is try and vilifi me as someon who been success __PUNCT__
or who close busi or laid peopl off __PUNCT__ an evil __PUNCT__ bad gui __PUNCT__
and that mai work __PUNCT__
i actual think that right now peopl ar sai __PUNCT__ i want somebodi who can make thing better __PUNCT__ that gonna motiv me __PUNCT__ who can get job for my kid and get rise incom __PUNCT__
and i hope to be abl to be the on who win that battl __PUNCT__
regi is gone __PUNCT__
i done the night __PUNCT__ the even show __PUNCT__
i been on letterman a coupl of time __PUNCT__
i been on leno more than a coupl time __PUNCT__ and now letterman hate me becaus i been on leno more than him __PUNCT__
thei veri jealou of on anoth as you know __PUNCT__
and there __PUNCT__ i wa ask to go on saturdai night live __PUNCT__
i did not do that __PUNCT__ in part becaus you want to show that you fun and you a good person __PUNCT__ but you also want to be presidenti __PUNCT__
and saturdai night live ha the potenti of look slapstick and not presidenti __PUNCT__
but the view is fine __PUNCT__
although the view is high risk becaus of the five women on it __PUNCT__ onli on is conserv __PUNCT__
four ar sharp __PUNCT__ tongu and not conserv __PUNCT__ whoopi goldberg in particular __PUNCT__
although last time i wa on the show __PUNCT__ she said to me __PUNCT__ you know what __PUNCT__ i think i could vote for you __PUNCT__

i had to sit down and __PUNCT__ oop __PUNCT__ darlen __PUNCT__ you get the last word __PUNCT__

and you know we had __PUNCT__ what her name __PUNCT__ hilari rosen __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ attack her __PUNCT__ and that made ann much more visibl to the american peopl __PUNCT__ which i think is veri help __PUNCT__
it gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwis __PUNCT__
and i agre with you __PUNCT__
i think she will be extraordinarili help __PUNCT__
just a quick __PUNCT__
can you be a friend of her on facebook or whatev happen after hilari rosen __PUNCT__ unintellig __PUNCT__ that show you the valu of social network and just how import the media can be in thi elect cycl __PUNCT__ and i just think that she is amaz __PUNCT__
