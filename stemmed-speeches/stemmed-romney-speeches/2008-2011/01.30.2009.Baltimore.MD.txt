and thank you for the vote you took thi week __PUNCT__
you stood strong __PUNCT__

you put the best interest of the american peopl ahead of polit __PUNCT__
i got some call yesterdai __PUNCT__ after the new __PUNCT__
thei said what i feel __PUNCT__
we want you to know that we proud of you __PUNCT__
it sure feel good to be in a room full of republican who came out ahead on elect dai __PUNCT__
you can be proud of your success __PUNCT__
and don't be afraid to remind the presid of thi __PUNCT__ you __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ won your elect __PUNCT__
after my own campaign wa over __PUNCT__ ann and i just want to get awai from it all __PUNCT__
we end up in beij __PUNCT__ about as far awai as you can get __PUNCT__
we went to the olymp game __PUNCT__ and on of the event we attend wa women beach volleybal __PUNCT__
i notic a lot of peopl look in our direct __PUNCT__ point toward us and take pictur __PUNCT__
it alwai nice to be recogn __PUNCT__ and i told ann __PUNCT__ let be sure to smile and look our best __PUNCT__
ann said __PUNCT__ thei might like us even more if we got out of the wai __PUNCT__ kobe bryant is stand right behind you __PUNCT__
a few month have pass sinc the elect __PUNCT__
it enough time to consid the outcom and take stock of our parti futur __PUNCT__
i want to make clear that i optimist __PUNCT__ our idea ar good __PUNCT__ our agenda will make america stronger __PUNCT__ and your action thi week show that we have the kind of leader who will stand up for what thei believ in __PUNCT__
i have often been ask what i think the republican parti must do to recov __PUNCT__
what i said is thi __PUNCT__ my first concern isn't about our parti __PUNCT__ it about our countri __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the two ar close relat __PUNCT__
the best wai for us to advanc the prospect of our parti is to do what we know is right for the countri __PUNCT__
thi is what the american peopl expect of us __PUNCT__
and that what we should expect of ourselv __PUNCT__
thi is a time of hardship and uncertainti for million of american __PUNCT__
the question is __PUNCT__ whose leadership and idea will turn thing around __PUNCT__
and in such a moment __PUNCT__ it our job to offer the clear answer __PUNCT__ the proven solut __PUNCT__ and resolut leadership that will make thi countri strong again __PUNCT__
the new presid and the congression major ar have a difficult time do that __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ thei have a lot of campaign rhetor to make good on __PUNCT__
and thei got plenti of special interest to pai back __PUNCT__
as the opposit parti __PUNCT__ we entir free to do what is right for the countri __PUNCT__
there ar certain advantag to that kind of freedom __PUNCT__ and i suggest we make the most of them __PUNCT__
that begin with a clear analysi of what need to get the economi move again __PUNCT__
predict that we ar almost out of the wood __PUNCT__ base on the length of prior recess __PUNCT__ ar wish think __PUNCT__
american have lost some __NUM__ trillion dollar in net worth __PUNCT__
that translat into about __NUM__ billion dollar less annual consum spend in the economi __PUNCT__
there someth els peopl don't talk much about __PUNCT__ the pool of invest capit __PUNCT__ all the monei avail for new invest __PUNCT__ busi start __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__ busi expans __PUNCT__ capit expenditur __PUNCT__ and new hire __PUNCT__
the size of that pool ha shrunk by trillion of dollar __PUNCT__
thi wa a huge loss in valu __PUNCT__ and the effect could be felt for year __PUNCT__ in busi that don't start up or grow __PUNCT__ in job that don't get creat __PUNCT__
given these extraordinari condit __PUNCT__ i am convinc that a stimulu is need __PUNCT__
so why not just spend and borrow with reckless abandon __PUNCT__ becaus we in a veri delic situat that could easili get wors if washington doe the wrong thing __PUNCT__
the packag which pass the hous is a huge increas in the amount of govern borrow __PUNCT__
and we borrow so much alreadi __PUNCT__ that if we add too much more debt __PUNCT__ or spend foolishli __PUNCT__ we could invit an even bigger crisi __PUNCT__
we could precipit a worldwid crisi of confid in america __PUNCT__ lead to a run on the dollar __PUNCT__ or hyper __PUNCT__ inflat that wipe out famili save and devast the middl class __PUNCT__
we on an econom tightrop __PUNCT__
that why it is so import to exercis extrem care and good judgment __PUNCT__
so far __PUNCT__ the democrat leadership hasn't shown a great deal of that __PUNCT__
thei pass __NUM__ billion in infrastructur spend __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of which won't be spent by the end of __NUM__ __PUNCT__
billion for electron medic health record __PUNCT__ it a fine idea __PUNCT__ but it won't produc job for year and year __PUNCT__
even wors ar the liber payoff __PUNCT__ __NUM__ million dollar for the nation endow for the art __PUNCT__ hundr of million of dollar to the state for std prevent and educ __PUNCT__
until your loud protest got it drop from the bill __PUNCT__ there even wa __NUM__ million dollar for the dc mall __PUNCT__
that might have grown some grass __PUNCT__ but it wouldn't have grown the economi __PUNCT__
and thei do thi when the economi is on a tightrop __PUNCT__
it still earli in the administr of presid obama __PUNCT__
like everyon who love thi countri __PUNCT__ i want him to adopt correct principl and then to succe __PUNCT__
he still ha a chanc to step in and insist on spend disciplin among the member of hi own parti __PUNCT__
it hi job to set prioriti __PUNCT__
i hope for america sake that he know that a chief execut can't vote __PUNCT__ present __PUNCT__ he can't let other run the show __PUNCT__
he ha to sai ye to some thing and no to a lot of other __PUNCT__
we need to stimul the economi __PUNCT__ not the govern __PUNCT__
a true stimulu packag __PUNCT__ on that respect the product and geniu of the american peopl __PUNCT__ could lift thi countri out of recess __PUNCT__
and experi show us what it should look like __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ there ar two wai you can put monei into the economi __PUNCT__ by spend more or by tax less __PUNCT__
but if it stimulu you want __PUNCT__ tax less work best __PUNCT__
that why perman tax cut should be the centerpiec of the econom stimulu __PUNCT__
even christin romer __PUNCT__ the presid own choic to lead the council of econom advisor __PUNCT__ found in her research that tax cut ar twice as effect as new spend __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ ani new spend must be strictli limit to project that ar essenti __PUNCT__
how do we defin essenti __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ a good rule is that the project we fund in a stimulu should be legitim govern prioriti that would have been carri out in the futur anywai __PUNCT__ and ar simpli be move up to creat those job now __PUNCT__
as we take out non __PUNCT__ essenti project __PUNCT__ we should focu on fund the real need of govern that will have immedi impact __PUNCT__
and what better place to begin than repair and replac militari equip that wa damag or destroi in kuwait __PUNCT__ iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ send out rebat check to citizen and busi is not a tax cut __PUNCT__
the media bought thi line so far __PUNCT__ but thei got it wrong __PUNCT__
check in the mail ar refund __PUNCT__ not tax cut __PUNCT__
we tri rebat check last year and thei did virtual noth to jump __PUNCT__ start the economi __PUNCT__
dispos incom went up __PUNCT__ but consumpt hardli move __PUNCT__
busi aren't stupid __PUNCT__
thei not go to invest in equip and new hire for a on time __PUNCT__ short term blip __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ by propos tax rebat __PUNCT__ the democrat ar admit that relief to famili and employ work __PUNCT__
why can't thei shed their ideolog bia and give the american peopl the kind of perman __PUNCT__ broad base tax relief that even thei must know will reliev the suffer our countri is go through __PUNCT__
fourth __PUNCT__ if we go to tax less and spend more to get the economi move __PUNCT__ then we have to make anoth commit as well __PUNCT__
as soon as thi economi recov __PUNCT__ we have to regain control over the feder budget __PUNCT__ and abov all __PUNCT__ over entitl spend __PUNCT__
thi is more import than most peopl ar will to admit __PUNCT__
i mention the econom tightrop befor __PUNCT__
there is a real danger that with trillion of addit borrow __PUNCT__ from the budget deficit and from the stimulu __PUNCT__ that world investor will begin to fear that the dollar won't be worth much in the futur __PUNCT__
thei mai fear hyper __PUNCT__ inflat __PUNCT__
it is essenti that we demonstr our commit to maintain the valu of the dollar __PUNCT__
that mean show the world that we will put a stop to runawai spend and borrow __PUNCT__
senat judd gregg is rightli propos a new bipartisan approach __PUNCT__
it should be part of thi bill __PUNCT__
fifth __PUNCT__ we must begin to recov from the enorm loss in the capit invest pool __PUNCT__
and the surest __PUNCT__ most obviou wai to get that done is to send a clear signal that there will be no tax increas on invest and capit gain __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ and __NUM__ tax cut should be extend perman __PUNCT__ or at least temporarili __PUNCT__
and final __PUNCT__ let exercis restraint in the size of the stimulu packag __PUNCT__
without restraint __PUNCT__ it mai grow as the dai go by __PUNCT__
last year __PUNCT__ with the economi alreadi falter __PUNCT__ i propos a stimulu of __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
the washington post said __PUNCT__ and i quot __PUNCT__ romnei plan is wai too big __PUNCT__ so what critiqu do thei have for the size of the democrat packag __PUNCT__ i afraid thei caught a bad case of liber laryng __PUNCT__
it everywher these dai __PUNCT__
in the final analysi __PUNCT__ we know that onli the privat sector __PUNCT__ entrepreneur and busi larg and small __PUNCT__ can creat the million of job our countri need __PUNCT__
the invis hand of the market alwai move faster and better than the heavi hand of govern __PUNCT__
the differ between us and the democrat is thi __PUNCT__ thei want to stimul the govern __PUNCT__ and we want to stimul the economi __PUNCT__
govern doe have an oblig to address some of the abus we seen in the market __PUNCT__ particularli in the mortgag financ market and the mortgag guarante sector __PUNCT__
but when market work as thei should __PUNCT__ when thei ar effect and effici regul __PUNCT__ free market creat job and boost incom __PUNCT__
as republican __PUNCT__ we remain the confid voic of limit govern and free enterpris __PUNCT__
these principl ar go to face anoth test when it come to healthcar __PUNCT__
we should be first to propos a republican plan to bring health insur to all american __PUNCT__ on base on market dynam __PUNCT__ free choic __PUNCT__ and person respons __PUNCT__
i think what we did in massachusett is a good model to start from __PUNCT__ but whatev direct we take __PUNCT__ let not simpli react to what the democrat do __PUNCT__
their own plan would undoubtedli creat a vast new system of costli entitl and bureaucrat dictat __PUNCT__ burden the peopl and threaten the economi __PUNCT__
american will be look for a better altern __PUNCT__
let give it to them __PUNCT__
let also defend the right of worker __PUNCT__ against coercion and intimid __PUNCT__
the work peopl of thi countri should be abl to union the wai their father and mother did __PUNCT__ by free choic and secret ballot __PUNCT__
the democrat __PUNCT__ plan to take awai those right would result in econom calam __PUNCT__
more than that __PUNCT__ it an insult to the digniti and common sens of work peopl __PUNCT__
we go to defend the freedom of worker and the right of labor __PUNCT__
interest __PUNCT__ isn't it __PUNCT__ which parti stand up for worker and which on jump for union boss __PUNCT__
our is the parti of freedom and enterpris __PUNCT__ and we ar the parti of life __PUNCT__
i know that i not alon in wonder why our new presid __PUNCT__ in the earliest hour of hi administr __PUNCT__ direct that intern group that promot and provid abort be fund with american taxpay dollar __PUNCT__
is that realli what the world need __PUNCT__ more abort __PUNCT__
in our parti __PUNCT__ we don't have perfect agreement on the life issu __PUNCT__
but with an administr that is firmli on the side of abort __PUNCT__ that answer to the most extrem wing of the abort lobbi __PUNCT__ our duti is clear __PUNCT__
we should be a voic for moder and compass __PUNCT__
and even if the administr will sai noth on behalf of the child wait to be born __PUNCT__ we must take the side of life __PUNCT__
the new administr ha also gain the favor of liber comment by pledg what it call reform in the treatment of detaine who have taken up arm against america __PUNCT__
and of cours __PUNCT__ presid obama sai he will close guantanamo __PUNCT__
but i wonder if he notic that some of the men alreadi releas from guantanamo have turn up in new al qaeda tape __PUNCT__ i also wonder where the presid now intend to send the terrorist we captur __PUNCT__
will he send them to nation that will releas them to kill american __PUNCT__ or will he send them to us prison __PUNCT__ to infect our own crimin popul __PUNCT__
there mai be more step like close guantanamo __PUNCT__ and thei will receiv the predict applaus from law professor __PUNCT__ editori board __PUNCT__ and other who have no respons for protect american live __PUNCT__
the washington post last week announc presid obama action with thi headlin __PUNCT__ bush war on terror come to a sudden end __PUNCT__ i hope thi presid know that the terrorist ar still fight and kill american __PUNCT__ and that thei plan to keep kill american __PUNCT__
here __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ our parti will speak confid __PUNCT__
we have no greater duti than a vigil defens __PUNCT__
thi great parti of our ha seen setback befor __PUNCT__
thei have never defin us __PUNCT__
for our parti __PUNCT__ i believ thi will be rememb as the time when we demonstr the strength of our convict __PUNCT__ when we defend the foundat of america prosper __PUNCT__ secur and liberti __PUNCT__
america will be test __PUNCT__
it not for us to choos everi new test that mai aris __PUNCT__
but we entir free to choos how we will face those test __PUNCT__
we face them as you did thi week __PUNCT__
and we face them as republican have done befor in our finest moment __PUNCT__ with the clariti and the confid of those who put their countri first __PUNCT__
that is the work you have undertaken as republican member of the __NUM__ congress __PUNCT__
you gather in smaller number than last year __PUNCT__ but you have idea __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ and convict __PUNCT__ and the resolv to lead america to a better futur __PUNCT__
the comeback for our nation and for our parti start with you __PUNCT__
you can count me as an alli in the work ahead __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
