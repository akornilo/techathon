some pollster ar predict that conserv will enjoi a landmark victori __PUNCT__
i can't guarante a specif outcom __PUNCT__ but on thing i know __PUNCT__ america will repudi obama __PUNCT__ style liber __PUNCT__
part of the reason is the abject failur of hi first two year in offic __PUNCT__
the presid incessantli remind us that he inherit a recess __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ that why we argu dure the campaign that it wa no time for on the job train __PUNCT__
if he or hi econom advisor had ani experi in the real economi __PUNCT__ he would have known that the first three rule for ani turnaround ar focu __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__ and focu __PUNCT__
but instead of focus on job and the economi __PUNCT__ he us the crisi as cover to push hi liber agenda __PUNCT__ from cap and trade to an ill __PUNCT__ conceiv takeov of healthcar __PUNCT__
america is sick and tire of an administr that exploit the econom crisi instead of solv it __PUNCT__
but lack of focu wasn't the onli problem __PUNCT__
ronald reagan us to sai thi about liber __PUNCT__ it not that thei ignor __PUNCT__ it that what thei know is wrong __PUNCT__ and the obama __PUNCT__ reid __PUNCT__ pelosi record is live __URL__ said that thei would help get famili and busi __PUNCT__ big and small __PUNCT__ back on their feet __PUNCT__

he call it ambiti __PUNCT__
it wa reckless __PUNCT__
he scare employ __PUNCT__ so job ar scarc __PUNCT__
the uncertainti and lack of predict he creat ha caus busi to shrink from spend and from hire __PUNCT__
he hasn't help end the crisi __PUNCT__ he made it deeper __PUNCT__ longer and more pain __PUNCT__
we have had govern declar war on poverti and war on drug __PUNCT__ but thi is the first time our govern ha declar war on free enterpris __PUNCT__
never befor ha feder polici been so hostil to the small busi we count on to help us grow out of recess __PUNCT__
not onli do small busi suffer from higher tax and regul __PUNCT__ thei have to face thenew cost and rule of obamacar __PUNCT__
and unlik the democrat who vote for the __NUM__ page monstros __PUNCT__ small busi will actual have to read it to figur out what thei have to do __PUNCT__
the white hous tri to argu that their stimulu ha help __PUNCT__
that a bit like sai that squirt water from a garden hose help put out a forest fire __PUNCT__
the question is not whether it help a littl __PUNCT__ but rather __PUNCT__ did it do the job __PUNCT__ or do as well as it could have __PUNCT__
and the answer is a resound __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ predict unemploy becam __NUM__ __PUNCT__
sinc the obama stimulu wa pass __PUNCT__ __NUM__ govern job have been creat __PUNCT__ but more than __NUM__ million privat sector job have been lost __PUNCT__
in ohio __PUNCT__ more than on in ten peopl ar out of work __PUNCT__

there ar now nearli __NUM__ million american that ar out of work __PUNCT__ if thei stood in a singl unemploy line __PUNCT__ it would stretch from the coast of california to washington d.c __PUNCT__ and then back again __PUNCT__ if that their vaunt __PUNCT__ recoveri summer __PUNCT__ heaven help us from their recoveri winter __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ the economi is slowli get better and eventu it will right itself __PUNCT__
it will be thank to the hard work and innov of the american peopl __PUNCT__
vice presid biden will sai that he and the presid deserv the credit __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ thei have prolong the recess __PUNCT__ extend the pain of jobless __PUNCT__ and ad to the burden of debt that will hang over the economi for gener __PUNCT__
their failur is on reason thei will serv onli on term __PUNCT__
isn't it fit that those who have such contempt for the privat sector will soon find themselv back in it __PUNCT__
if onli the presid would have made the economi job on __PUNCT__
if onli he had listen to conserv who call for less tax __PUNCT__ less spend __PUNCT__ less borrow and less govern __PUNCT__
if onli he had craft incent for busi to hire and invest __PUNCT__

if onli he had confront the grow threat from unfund entitl __PUNCT__ unfund pension and gargantuan liabil at freddi mac and fanni mae __PUNCT__
if onli hehad in fact been transpar and bipartisan and unit __PUNCT__ as he pledg in hiss campaign __PUNCT__
then __PUNCT__ perhaps,h could have deliv on hi promis of __PUNCT__ ye we can __PUNCT__ instead __PUNCT__ america know all too well that __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ he didn't __PUNCT__
and it iron that a presid who said he would unit the countri ha turn out to be on of the most divis in histori __PUNCT__
but he ha succeed in on wai __PUNCT__ he ha unit most of the voter against him __PUNCT__
the presid foreign polici ha not compens for hi failur at home __PUNCT__
under hi engag polici __PUNCT__ north korea ha test nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ launch long rang missil __PUNCT__ and sunk a south korean ship __PUNCT__
and iran ha fund yemeni insurg __PUNCT__ arm terrorist __PUNCT__ and acceler it nuclear program __PUNCT__
he gave russian their number on foreign polici object __PUNCT__ abandon of our eastern europ missil defens __PUNCT__ and got noth in return __PUNCT__
he insult israel at the unit nation and forgot to mention that hama ha launch thousand of rocket into that countri __PUNCT__
our success in iraq is in spite of hi polici prefer and thank to those of hi predecessor __PUNCT__ georg w __PUNCT__ bush __PUNCT__
and hi strategi in afghanistan hasbeen needlessli muddl by announc a withdraw date __PUNCT__ unfortun put domest polit ahead of nation purpos __PUNCT__
ye __PUNCT__ we have seriou enemi and grow threat around the world __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ we have an administr whose idea of a rogu state is arizona __PUNCT__
these ar among the reason why liber will have a bad __DATE__ __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ the pundit will be right that thi will not be the first time that power ha been taken awai from on polit parti and given to the other __PUNCT__
but what is occur in america todai is differ than simpli a shift in seat __PUNCT__
and it is not mere the result of disappoint or anger __PUNCT__ though there mai well be reason for both __PUNCT__
what is be felt in america todai is more profound than that __PUNCT__ more solemn __PUNCT__ more sober __PUNCT__
american believ that washington is threaten the veri foundat of what ha made america __PUNCT__ america __PUNCT__
washington is assault america valu __PUNCT__
it is endeavor to chang what thi nation ha been __PUNCT__ to chang what it is __PUNCT__ and to chang what it is destin to becom __PUNCT__
thi room is fill everi year by citizen __PUNCT__ modern patriot __PUNCT__ who ar passion about america __URL__ valu includ the sanctiti of life and the preserv of marriag __PUNCT__
but the obama administr ha taken it assault to even more american valu __PUNCT__
the american peopl have final seen obama liber for what it is __PUNCT__ thei have seen the counterfeit valu that underli it __PUNCT__ and thei want none of it __PUNCT__ the liber __PUNCT__ valu includ spend and borrow on behalf of my gener even though it will bankrupt my children and grandchildren gener __PUNCT__
thei believ that the rule of law should be subordin to their view of the greater good __PUNCT__
thei believ that govern know best how to care for your health __PUNCT__ not you __PUNCT__ not your doctor __PUNCT__
thei believ that the reward of success should be taken from the person who creat them and given to those who did not __PUNCT__
thei believ that worker shouldn't have the right to vote by secret ballot as to whether or not thei want a union __PUNCT__
and even though on half of the children in our citi do not graduat from high school __PUNCT__ thei believ that parent choic and teacher account should bow to the interest of union boss __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ i afraid that some in washington todai ar driven by such differ valu that thei wouldchang the veri charact of america __PUNCT__
let me explain what i mean with a person observ __PUNCT__
at christma __PUNCT__ time __PUNCT__ i wa in wal __PUNCT__ mart to bui some toi for my grandkid __PUNCT__
as i wait in the check __PUNCT__ outlin __PUNCT__ i took a good look around the store __PUNCT__
i thought to myself __PUNCT__ thi store remind me of sam walton __PUNCT__
i never met him __PUNCT__ but what i read about him wa that he wa passion about low price __PUNCT__ on everyth peopl might want __PUNCT__
and he wa somewhat impetu __PUNCT__
hi store ar a lot like him __PUNCT__ low price __PUNCT__ ton of differ item __PUNCT__ and a store that isn't __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ terribl well organ __PUNCT__
it not like a target __PUNCT__ for instance,wher everyth line up just so __PUNCT__
and then i thought about other enterpris i know __PUNCT__ and how much their founder have shape them __PUNCT__
microsoft is a reflect of bill gate __PUNCT__ just as appl is of steve job __PUNCT__
in some wai __PUNCT__ disneyland is a physic legaci of walt disnei himself __PUNCT__ imagin __PUNCT__ creativ and whimsic __PUNCT__
virgin airlin is as irrever and edgi as it founder __PUNCT__ richard branson __PUNCT__
i found that it not just busi that ar shape by their founder __PUNCT__ it true of institut of allkind __PUNCT__ school __PUNCT__ univers __PUNCT__ chariti __PUNCT__ even church __PUNCT__
it also true of countri __PUNCT__ countri ar shape by their founder and by those who have led them __PUNCT__ oftenfor mani centuri after those founder ar gone __PUNCT__
i often imagin what it must have been like for those first peopl who left europ to immigr to america __PUNCT__
thei left behind home __PUNCT__ famili __PUNCT__ secur and predict in exchang for a life __PUNCT__ threaten ocean passag __PUNCT__ the possibl of hostil indigen peopl __PUNCT__ and uncertain shelter __PUNCT__ food and climat __PUNCT__
some who came here sought fortun __PUNCT__
other sought the right to practic their religion accord to the dictat of their conscienc __PUNCT__
in almost everi heart __PUNCT__ it wa a strain of liberti that drew them here __PUNCT__ religi liberti __PUNCT__ econom liberti __PUNCT__ freedom to pioneer __PUNCT__ or freedom from oppress __PUNCT__
the thirst for freedom drove these american colonist __PUNCT__
it ha been a quintessenti american valu from the begin __PUNCT__
the founder who draft the declar of independ and the constitut made a trade veri much like the first colonist __PUNCT__
thei could have chosen the predict and secur path __PUNCT__ follow the command of the crown __PUNCT__
thei could have establish their own form of monarchi __PUNCT__ a power __PUNCT__ autocrat govern that would likewis tell peopl what to make __PUNCT__ where to sell it __PUNCT__ and how much thei would earn __PUNCT__
but instead __PUNCT__ thei choos freedom __PUNCT__
just as the peopl would be free to choos their govern __PUNCT__ thei would be free to choos their occup and their life cours __PUNCT__ to pursu happi accord to their own dream __PUNCT__
that choic by the found parent ha made all the differ __PUNCT__
peopl from all over the world who prize freedom __PUNCT__ the innov __PUNCT__ the pioneer __PUNCT__ the dreamer __PUNCT__ came to america __PUNCT__
thi is who we ar as a peopl __PUNCT__ it is in our dna __PUNCT__
it is thi love of liberti and the accompani spirit of invent __PUNCT__ creativity,dar __PUNCT__ do __PUNCT__ and pioneer that have propel america to becom the most power nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
thi cours for america __PUNCT__ chosen by the founder __PUNCT__ ha been settl for over __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
our is the creed of the pioneer __PUNCT__ the innov __PUNCT__ the striver who expect no guarante of success __PUNCT__ but ask onli to live andwork in freedom __PUNCT__
thi creed __PUNCT__ thi valu __PUNCT__ is under assault in washington todai __PUNCT__
liber ar convinc that govern know better than the peopl how to run our busi __PUNCT__ how to choos win technolog __PUNCT__ how to manag healthcar __PUNCT__ how to grow an economi __PUNCT__ and how to order our veri __URL__ want to gain through govern takeov what thei could never achiev in the competit economi __PUNCT__ power and control over the peopl of america __PUNCT__
if thei were to succe __PUNCT__ thei would smother the veri spirit that ha built the nation __PUNCT__ the liber __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ invent __PUNCT__ creat __PUNCT__ independ current that run from coast to coast __PUNCT__
the obama administr promis that thei would __PUNCT__ fundament chang the wai washington work __PUNCT__ thei misl us __PUNCT__
thei ar try to chang the wai america work __PUNCT__ and we must not let them __PUNCT__
thi administr doe not lack for confid __PUNCT__
but confid in yourself is not the same as confid in your countri __PUNCT__
and believ in the power of govern is not the same as believ in the power of the govern __PUNCT__
in a world where other have lost their liberti by trade it awai for the fals promis of the state __PUNCT__ we choos to hold to our found valu __PUNCT__
we will stop these power __PUNCT__ seeker where thei stand __PUNCT__
we will preserv america charact as the land of liberti __PUNCT__
we welcom those who seek and will defend freedom __PUNCT__ we admir the entrepreneur __PUNCT__ the inventor __PUNCT__ the innov __PUNCT__
we will insist on great from everi on of our citizen __PUNCT__ and rather than apolog for who we ar or for what we have accomplished,w will celebr our nation strength and good __PUNCT__
american patriot have defeat tyrant __PUNCT__ liber the oppress __PUNCT__ and rescu the afflict __PUNCT__
america model of innov __PUNCT__ capit and free enterpris ha lift liter billion of the world poor out of poverti __PUNCT__
america ha been a forc for good like no other in thi world __PUNCT__ and for that we make no apolog __PUNCT__
