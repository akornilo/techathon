at the time __PUNCT__ we didn't know what sort of a presid he would make __PUNCT__
it wa a moment of crisi for our economi __PUNCT__ and when barack obama came to offic __PUNCT__ we wish him well and hope for the best __PUNCT__

thei in their earli forti __PUNCT__ a coupl who had work hard __PUNCT__ sacrif to bui a home in a good neighborhood __PUNCT__ the sort of place thei want their daughter alli to grow up __PUNCT__
but now that neighborhood is be crush by thi obama economi __PUNCT__
first their neighbor start lose their job __PUNCT__ and then their home __PUNCT__
and all around them now ar abandon hous __PUNCT__ and abandon dream __PUNCT__
when the tyler wake up in the morn and get alli off to school and then go to work and do everyth thei can to make it to the end of the month and hold their live togeth __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter if thei ar republican or democrat __PUNCT__ independ or __PUNCT__ libertarian __PUNCT__

an american famili __PUNCT__
and across the richest __PUNCT__ greatest countri on earth __PUNCT__ there ar million of american famili like the tyler __PUNCT__
folk who grew up believ that if thei plai by the rule __PUNCT__ work hard __PUNCT__ that thei would have the chanc to build a good life __PUNCT__ with steadi work and alwai that possibl to work a littl harder and get ahead __PUNCT__

you know it the same wai we know that tomorrow morn the sun is go to come up in the east right over thi field __PUNCT__
that confid in a better tomorrow defin us as american __PUNCT__
when gener of immigr look up and saw the statu of liberti for the first time __PUNCT__ thei sure had mani question and doubt about the life befor them __PUNCT__ but on thing thei knew without a doubt is that thei were come to a place where anyth wa possibl __PUNCT__ that in america __PUNCT__ their children would have a better life __PUNCT__
i believ in that america __PUNCT__
i know you believ in that america __PUNCT__
it is an america of freedom and opportun __PUNCT__
a nation where innov and hard work propel the most power economi in the world __PUNCT__
a land that is secur by the greatest militari the world ha ever seen __PUNCT__ and by friend and alli across the globe __PUNCT__
presid obama see a differ america and ha taken us in a differ direct __PUNCT__
a few month into offic __PUNCT__ he travel around the globe to apolog for america __PUNCT__
at a time of histor chang and great opportun in the arab world __PUNCT__ he is hesit and uncertain __PUNCT__
he hesit to speak out for the dissid in iran __PUNCT__ but hi administr boast that he is __PUNCT__ lead from behind __PUNCT__ in libya __PUNCT__
he speak with firm and clariti __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ when it come to israel __PUNCT__
he seem firmli and clearli determin to undermin our longtim friend and alli __PUNCT__
he treat israel the same wai so mani european countri have __PUNCT__ with suspicion __PUNCT__ distrust and an assumpt that israel is at fault __PUNCT__
to hi credit __PUNCT__ the presid order the raid that kill osama bin laden __PUNCT__
in afghanistan __PUNCT__ the surg wa right __PUNCT__ announc a withdraw date wa wrong __PUNCT__
the taliban mai not have watch __PUNCT__ but thei do have calendar __PUNCT__
here at home __PUNCT__ the presid seem to take hi inspir not from the small town and villag of new hampshir but from the capit of europ __PUNCT__
with the economi in crisi __PUNCT__ hi answer is to borrow monei we can't afford and throw it at washington bureaucrat and politician __PUNCT__
just like europ __PUNCT__
instead of encourag entrepreneur and employ __PUNCT__ he rais their tax __PUNCT__ pile on record __PUNCT__ break mound of regul and bureaucraci and give more power to union boss __PUNCT__
instead of recogn the state right author to solv problem __PUNCT__ he seiz power from them and ram through a disastr nation health care plan __PUNCT__
thi presid first answer to everi problem is to take power from you __PUNCT__ your local govern and your state so that so __PUNCT__ call __PUNCT__ expert __PUNCT__ in washington can make those choic for you __PUNCT__
and with each of these decis __PUNCT__ we lose more of our freedom __PUNCT__
you and i understand thi __PUNCT__
we look at our countri __PUNCT__ and we know in our heart that thing aren't right __PUNCT__ and thei not get better __PUNCT__
presid obama european answer ar not the right solut to america challeng __PUNCT__

i never held offic befor but i went at it like i ran busi and the olymp __PUNCT__ ask tough question and take on the toughest problem first __PUNCT__ becaus thei onli get wors __PUNCT__

that sent a messag that busi as usual wa over __PUNCT__
over the next four year __PUNCT__ we consolid agenc __PUNCT__ cut program __PUNCT__ sold state properti and cut tax nineteen time __PUNCT__
the state wa give awai over a billion dollar in free health care __PUNCT__ much of it to peopl who could have paid someth but were game the system __PUNCT__
you won't be surpris that a lot of democrat thought we should be give awai even more __PUNCT__
i took it on and hammer out a solut that took a bad situat and made it better __PUNCT__
not perfect but it wa a state solut for a state problem __PUNCT__
at the end of four year __PUNCT__ it took over __NUM__ veto but we balanc everi budget __PUNCT__ restor a __MONEY__ billion dollar raini dai fund and kept our school first among all __NUM__ state __PUNCT__
all of these experi __PUNCT__ start and run busi for __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ turn around the olymp __PUNCT__ govern a state __PUNCT__ have help shape who i am and how i lead __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ if i ran through a list of all my mistak __PUNCT__ ann would find it hilari __PUNCT__ and we be here all night __PUNCT__
but i learn a lot __PUNCT__
turn around a crisi take experienc leadership and bold action __PUNCT__
for million of american __PUNCT__ the economi is in crisi todai __PUNCT__ and unless we chang cours __PUNCT__ it will be in crisi for all of us tomorrow __PUNCT__
govern under presid obama ha grown to consum almost __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of our economi __PUNCT__

i will cap feder spend at __NUM__ __PUNCT__ or less of the gdp and final __PUNCT__ final balanc the budget __PUNCT__

from my first dai in offic my number on job will be to see that america onc again is number on in job creation __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ if you want to creat job __PUNCT__ it help to have had a job __PUNCT__
i will make busi tax competit with other nation __PUNCT__ modern regul and bureaucraci and final promot america trade interest __PUNCT__
it time for a presid who care more about america worker than he doe about america union boss __PUNCT__
over the last thirti year __PUNCT__ i can't tell you how mani time i heard a situat is hopeless __PUNCT__
but i never been veri good at listen to those peopl and i alwai enjoi prove them wrong __PUNCT__
it on of the lesson i learn from my dad __PUNCT__
my father never graduat from colleg __PUNCT__
he apprent __PUNCT__ as a lath and plaster carpent __PUNCT__ and he wa darn good at it __PUNCT__
he learn how to put a hand of nail in hi mouth and spit them out __PUNCT__ point forward __PUNCT__
on their honeymoon __PUNCT__ he and mom drove across the countri __PUNCT__
dad sold aluminum paint along the wai __PUNCT__ to pai for ga and hotel __PUNCT__
there were a lot reason my father could have given up or set hi sight lower __PUNCT__
but dad alwai believ in america __PUNCT__ and in that america __PUNCT__ a lath and plaster man could work hi wai up to run a littl car compani call american motor __PUNCT__ and end up governor of a state where he had onc sold aluminum paint __PUNCT__
for my dad __PUNCT__ america wa the land of opportun __PUNCT__ where the circumst of birth ar no barrier to achiev on dream __PUNCT__
small busi and entrepreneur were encourag __PUNCT__ and respect __PUNCT__ and a good worker could almost alwai find a good job __PUNCT__
the spirit of enterpris __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ pioneer and can __PUNCT__ do propel our standard of live and economi past everi other nation on earth __PUNCT__
i refus to believ that america is just anoth place on the map with a flag __PUNCT__
we stand for freedom and opportun and hope __PUNCT__
these last two year have not been the best of time __PUNCT__
but while we lost a coupl of year __PUNCT__ we have not lost our wai __PUNCT__
the principl that made us a great nation and leader of the world have not lost their mean __PUNCT__
thei never will __PUNCT__
we know we can bring thi countri back __PUNCT__
