and my thank to all of you for the warm welcom __PUNCT__
it good to see so mani friend and leader of the conserv movement from across america __PUNCT__
a year ago __PUNCT__ there were quit a few peopl who were readi to write off thi movement __PUNCT__
thei were enthral by barack obama promis of near __PUNCT__ biblic transform __PUNCT__
their leg were tingl __PUNCT__
he spoke majest __PUNCT__ frame by greek column __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ he can still spin a speech __PUNCT__ but he can't spin hi record __PUNCT__
i bet you never dream you look back at jimmi carter as the good old dai __PUNCT__
i had the pleasur of attend the valu voter summit everi year sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i know that what bring us togeth is our allegi to import and endur valu __PUNCT__ the secur of our countri __PUNCT__ the defens of freedom in the world __PUNCT__ the success of our free enterpris system __PUNCT__ and the fundament right of everi person __PUNCT__ includ the right to life itself __PUNCT__ these caus unit us __PUNCT__ and thei inspir us for the work ahead __PUNCT__
we know that america ha alwai endur a choru of critic __PUNCT__ peopl who claim that everi ill __PUNCT__ everi failur in the world is america fault __PUNCT__
but it ha never befor had a presid who wa conduct that choru __PUNCT__
he told an arab tv station that america ha dictat to other nation __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ america ha freed other nation from dictat __PUNCT__
he told the european that america ha been arrog __PUNCT__ dismiss and deris __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ in defend liberti __PUNCT__ america ha been dilig __PUNCT__ dedic and decis __PUNCT__
sure __PUNCT__ when an american presid journei abroad __PUNCT__ it alwai nice to see him applaud and prais __PUNCT__
but when the price for that ador is on apolog after anoth for alleg offens by the unit state of america __PUNCT__ it not worth it __PUNCT__
frankli __PUNCT__ i rather see a presid greet abroad by complet silenc __PUNCT__ as long as he is defend our countri charact and not plai to our countri critic __PUNCT__
these ar time that call for a strong america __PUNCT__
china is on track to becom the largest economi in the world __PUNCT__
russia under putin is edg back to it old totalitarian wai __PUNCT__ kill journalist __PUNCT__ harass polit enemi __PUNCT__ and invad a sovereign neighbor __PUNCT__
jihadist murder and threaten innoc peopl in nation around the world __PUNCT__ and plot to attack us here at home __PUNCT__
the regim in north korea sacrific it own peopl to serv it nuclear ambit __PUNCT__
the regim in iran __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ is move fast to develop a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
and all the while __PUNCT__ our economi is reel and our debt ar mount __PUNCT__
let me sai it again __PUNCT__ these ar time that call for a strong america __PUNCT__
we know the sourc of america strength __PUNCT__
it is the citizen of thi countri __PUNCT__ and all that a free peopl can achiev __PUNCT__
free __PUNCT__ hard work __PUNCT__ famili orient __PUNCT__ risk take __PUNCT__ opportun __PUNCT__ seek __PUNCT__ patriot american peopl have alwai been the sourc of our strength __PUNCT__ and thei alwai will be __PUNCT__
and here in washington __PUNCT__ the best polici ar those that expand their freedom __PUNCT__ broaden their opportun __PUNCT__ allow them to keep more of what thei earn __PUNCT__ afford them better educ __PUNCT__ let them choos their own healthcar __PUNCT__ and turn loos the free enterpris system to creat more job __PUNCT__
what presid obama ha done these last eight month __PUNCT__ and what he is propos for the next three year __PUNCT__ would not strengthen america __PUNCT__ it would weaken america __PUNCT__
hi so __PUNCT__ call stimulu is a case in point __PUNCT__
the presid sold it as an immedi boost that would hold unemploy below eight percent __PUNCT__ restor the economi and creat job __PUNCT__
rather than bring back the economi __PUNCT__ it brought back __NUM__ year of fail liber program __PUNCT__
and he rush it through befor anyon could even notic __PUNCT__
but we did notic __PUNCT__ and we not impress __PUNCT__
the economi is still shrink even as the govern keep grow __PUNCT__
unemploy blew past eight percent to nearli __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ that million and million more american out of work __PUNCT__
not on new job ha been creat __PUNCT__
the number of american oppos the obama agenda ar grow __PUNCT__
the voter will make that clear in the __NUM__ elect __PUNCT__
now that a __PUNCT__ public option __PUNCT__ i agre with __PUNCT__
the presid spend and borrow ha also weaken the nation __PUNCT__
in the month of __DATE__ alon __PUNCT__ he ad __NUM__ billion dollar to the deficit __PUNCT__
hi plan is to add anoth trillion dollar in debt everi year he is in offic __PUNCT__
he initi admit that the cumul deficit would swell by seven trillion dollar over the next ten year __PUNCT__ but now he acknowledg that nine trillion is more like it __PUNCT__
he would doubl our nation debt in just five year __PUNCT__
these deficit __PUNCT__ combin with our liabil for entitl __PUNCT__ threaten to caus a global collaps of confid in america and in the dollar __PUNCT__ and to precipit an even deeper financi crisi __PUNCT__
put such a spirit __PUNCT__ crush __PUNCT__ back __PUNCT__ break debt burden on our children is unworthi of our nation charact __PUNCT__
that is why i believ that thi spend and borrow is not just econom irrespons __PUNCT__ it is moral wrong __PUNCT__
to strengthen the economi and to creat job __PUNCT__ the presid must stop try to borrow thi countri out of a debt problem __PUNCT__
i know there ar peopl who ar now talk about anoth stimulu bill for the economi __PUNCT__
that the wrong answer __PUNCT__
the right answer is to fix the stimulu we have __PUNCT__ throw out the liber __PUNCT__ big __PUNCT__ govern program and substitut incent that will stimul the privat sector and actual creat job __PUNCT__
don't repeat the stimulu __PUNCT__ repair the stimulu __PUNCT__
take more monei awai from work american would make us a weaker nation __PUNCT__
candid obama promis not to rais tax __PUNCT__ by on dime __PUNCT__ on peopl make less than __NUM__ thousand dollar a year __PUNCT__
the presid cap and trade program demolish that promis __PUNCT__
the obama team had secretli calcul that hi plan would cost the averag american famili __MONEY__ a year __PUNCT__ the equival to a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ incom tax hike __PUNCT__
it kill job __PUNCT__
and becaus it will simpli move greenhous ga emitt from america to other nation like china __PUNCT__ it won't do a thing to affect climat chang __PUNCT__
democrat keep talk about climat chang __PUNCT__
i think thei confus global warm with all the heat thei been take at town hall __PUNCT__
i think we can all agre that it is a good idea to reform healthcar __PUNCT__
healthier american will make a stronger nation __PUNCT__
insur compani shouldn't drop peopl when thei get sick __PUNCT__
we need to help peopl with pre __PUNCT__ exist condit __PUNCT__
i think insur should be portabl and afford __PUNCT__
republican have propos sever healthcar reform bill __PUNCT__
and thi republican work to reform healthcar in my own state __PUNCT__
not everi featur of our plan is perfect __PUNCT__ but the lesson it teach is thi __PUNCT__ we can get everyon insur __PUNCT__ without break the bank and without a govern option __PUNCT__ there is no govern insur in my massachusett reform __PUNCT__
the right answer for health care is not more govern __PUNCT__ it less govern __PUNCT__
presid obama sai he want __PUNCT__ public option govern insur __PUNCT__ to give peopl __PUNCT__ greater choic __PUNCT__ but what he doesn't tell you is that there ar more than a thousand insur compani __PUNCT__
he sai he want an option that doesn't have the burden of corpor profit __PUNCT__
but what he doesn't tell you is that there ar plenti of major insur compani that ar not __PUNCT__ for __PUNCT__ profit __PUNCT__
he sai he be satisfi with co __PUNCT__ op __PUNCT__
but what he doesn't tell you is that there ar alreadi co __PUNCT__ op and no legisl is need to form more of them __PUNCT__
what he won't sai is what he realli want __PUNCT__ a public option that over time becom the onli option __PUNCT__
and if he get what he want __PUNCT__ we know exactli where it would inevit lead __PUNCT__ to an entitl with massiv liabil __PUNCT__ to more borrow __PUNCT__ to denial of care or ration just as thei experi in europ __PUNCT__ and to the creation of dozen of govern bureaucraci reach into everi hospit __PUNCT__ everi doctor offic and everi home __PUNCT__
he not go to get hi wai __PUNCT__ thank to million of america who have step up in town hall and tea parti across the countri __PUNCT__
the democrat call them a mob __PUNCT__ crazi __PUNCT__ trash __PUNCT__ i call them patriot __PUNCT__
i for on wa not unhappi that the presid chose to address our schoolchildren __PUNCT__
the heritag foundat __PUNCT__ in a __DATE__ letter to the presid __PUNCT__ remind him that he is in a uniqu posit to help our children keep from make a critic and life __PUNCT__ alter mistak __PUNCT__
and that is have children befor thei ar marri __PUNCT__
forti percent of all children ar now born out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ wedlock __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ there ar wonder singl parent who do a heroic job rais children in difficult circumst __PUNCT__
but for the nation as a whole __PUNCT__ we rais a stronger gener when thei ar rais by a mom and a dad __PUNCT__
a strong america depend on a strong defens __PUNCT__
rival ar pursu design and purpos veri differ from our own __PUNCT__
we must never cut corner in fund and equip the militari and the intellig servic that defend our countri __PUNCT__
more than __NUM__ of our peopl in uniform ar still deploi in theater of war __PUNCT__
noth on the agenda of the presid or congress must come befor the need of our troop and the absolut necess of their victori __PUNCT__
in the face of iran rush to becom a nuclear power __PUNCT__ the presid decis thi week to walk awai from our commit to missil defens in europ is alarm and danger __PUNCT__
thei sai that iran isn't as close to becom a nuclear threat as thei onc thought __PUNCT__
how can thei possibl know that __PUNCT__ thei sai thi is a token of goodwil for russia to get them to support sanction on iran __PUNCT__
but the first rule of negoti is thi __PUNCT__ onli give someth awai when you get someth __PUNCT__
from israel __PUNCT__ to hondura __PUNCT__ to the czech republ and poland __PUNCT__ it time the presid treat our friend better than he doe our foe __PUNCT__
we need to urg pro __PUNCT__ defens member of congress __PUNCT__ democrat and republican alik __PUNCT__ to hold firm __PUNCT__ and to make the case for a militari that is second to none __PUNCT__
those pro __PUNCT__ defens congressmen and senat might feel outnumb right now __PUNCT__
but thei shouldn't lose hope __PUNCT__ becaus we go to send them some reinforc in next year elect __PUNCT__
we now gone eight year and eight dai without be hit again at home __PUNCT__
and over on the left __PUNCT__ thei want veri hard for us to believ that thi fact ha noth whatev to do with the intens interrog of terrorist __PUNCT__

we must not allow big govern activist to exploit the financi crisi that thei themselv unknowingli enabl __PUNCT__ to substitut their ideolog for the wisdom and good sens of the american peopl __PUNCT__
there someth els that should concern us when the feder govern expand at such a rate __PUNCT__
when govern is try to take over health care __PUNCT__ bui car compani __PUNCT__ bail out bank __PUNCT__ and give half the white hous staff the titl of czar __PUNCT__ we have everi good reason to be alarm and to speak our mind __PUNCT__
