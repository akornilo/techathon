charl krauthamm wrote that dure the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ american seem to take a __PUNCT__ holidai from histori __PUNCT__ the economi wa strong and with the cold war over __PUNCT__ the world appear to be pretti well settl __PUNCT__
but histori ha come back now __PUNCT__ with a vengeanc __PUNCT__
the presid promis that hi uniqu person background would give him special insight into foreign polici __PUNCT__
what we have seen instead is a presid that is unprepar and unequ to the task of lead the free world __PUNCT__
he support hondura __PUNCT__ marxist presid __PUNCT__ but put off pro __PUNCT__ american colombia __PUNCT__
at the unit nation __PUNCT__ he condemn israel __PUNCT__ but ignor hama __PUNCT__ thousand of devast rocket __PUNCT__
hi propos engag with iran and north korea that won him the nobel prize __PUNCT__ how ha that work out __PUNCT__ iran is arm hama and hezbollah and rush toward nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
north korea test nuke __PUNCT__ launch missil __PUNCT__ sunk a ship __PUNCT__ and shell a south korean __URL__ the middl east __PUNCT__ the presid wa silent last year when dissent took to the street to challeng iran fanat ayatollah __PUNCT__
and now __PUNCT__ with the entir middl east in turmoil __PUNCT__ he and hi administr were caught off guard __PUNCT__
the presid and hi team look like deer in the headlight __PUNCT__
instead of lead the world __PUNCT__ the presid ha been tipto behind the european __PUNCT__
newsweek magazin thi week said that he hasn't just lost hi foreign polici map for the middl east __PUNCT__ he doesn't even have on __PUNCT__
thi is the first time in a quarter of a centuri that america ha had no discern foreign polici __PUNCT__
not sinc the dai of jimmi carter have we had such a foreign polici vacuum in washington __PUNCT__
and it could not have come at a wors time __PUNCT__
here at home __PUNCT__ the presid point out that he inherit an econom crisi __PUNCT__
he did __PUNCT__
and he promptli made it wors __PUNCT__
he borrow nearli a trillion dollar and promis that it would keep unemploy below __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it blew past that level and hasn't look back sinc __PUNCT__
our current high unemploy isn't just a statist __PUNCT__
it is __NUM__ million american out of work __PUNCT__
it kid who can't go to colleg __PUNCT__ it peopl in the prime of their life who wonder if thei will ever find a good pai job again __PUNCT__ it marriag that crack under the strain __PUNCT__
thi is not just a polici problem __PUNCT__ it is a moral tragedi __PUNCT__
the presid and hi administr ar fail our fellow american in on of their fundament respons __PUNCT__
the presid should have learn a lesson from new hampshir __PUNCT__
anyon who see the row after row of textil mill build in manchest know that thi state ha experienc econom crisi __PUNCT__
new hampshir answer wa to hold down tax and red tape __PUNCT__ to balanc it budget __PUNCT__ to keep govern effici __PUNCT__ and to keep it small __PUNCT__
and the end result wa that the state becam a capit of innov and small busi __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ those manchest mill ar teem with activ __PUNCT__
new hampshir is home to cut __PUNCT__ edg compani in militari technolog __PUNCT__ healthcar __PUNCT__ electron __PUNCT__ energi __PUNCT__ just to name a few __PUNCT__ it is a hotb of entrepreneur __PUNCT__
senat obama campaign hard in new hampshir but he appar didn't like what he saw __PUNCT__
he certainli didn't learn from it __PUNCT__
instead of lower tax __PUNCT__ he rais them __PUNCT__
he wrap busi in red tape __PUNCT__ he grew govern __PUNCT__ he borrow trillion of dollar __PUNCT__ and he made it clear that he doesn't like busi peopl veri much __PUNCT__
he creat a deeper recess __PUNCT__ and delai the recoveri __PUNCT__
the consequ is soar number of american endur unemploy __PUNCT__ foreclosur and bankruptci __PUNCT__
thi is the obama miseri index __PUNCT__ and it is at a record high __PUNCT__
it go to take more than new rhetor to put american back to work __PUNCT__ it go to take a new presid __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ i spent my career in the privat sector __PUNCT__
i know how job ar creat and how job ar lost __PUNCT__
i have help guid more than on enterpris that wa in crisi __PUNCT__
and i learn that there ar three rule of everi success turnaround __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__
turnaround work when the leader focus on what most import __PUNCT__
presid obama did just the opposit __PUNCT__ he deleg the job crisi to nanci pelosi and harri reid and he went to work on hi own liber prioriti __PUNCT__ like cap and trade and govern __PUNCT__ run healthcar __PUNCT__
the next presid must focu on what most import __PUNCT__ get american back to work __PUNCT__
let me mention a few of the thing the next presid must do to restor our economi and creat job __PUNCT__
i start with tax __PUNCT__
our employ pai the highest tax in the world __PUNCT__ ti with japan __PUNCT__
even franc and itali have lower tax than we do __PUNCT__ and it our small compani that ar particularli hard hit __PUNCT__
we have to cut their tax __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ we need to sai no to the corpor loophol and special deal that reward influenc and punish product __PUNCT__
and we need to stop penal compani that want to invest in america __PUNCT__
right now __PUNCT__ we tax compani who make monei oversea if thei want to bring it home __PUNCT__ but we don't tax them if thei keep their monei abroad __PUNCT__
that make no sens at all __PUNCT__
we want that monei here __PUNCT__ invest in new factori __PUNCT__ new equip __PUNCT__ and new job __PUNCT__
how much monei do american compani store oversea that wait to come back __PUNCT__ estim rang as high as on trillion dollar __PUNCT__
bring a trillion dollar back to the unit state will creat hundr of thousand __PUNCT__ or even million of good __PUNCT__ perman __PUNCT__ privat sector job __PUNCT__
the next presid is also go to have clean up the red tape __PUNCT__ bureaucraci and tax mess that thi administr ha left behind __PUNCT__
it is simpli choke job creation __PUNCT__
now i like presid obama __PUNCT__ but he doesn't have a clue how job ar creat __PUNCT__
he doesn't know what goe through an entrepreneur mind when she borrow and scrape to get the monei to start a new compani __PUNCT__ becaus he never done it himself __PUNCT__
he doesn't know how mani busi fail becaus of govern __PUNCT__ heavi hand __PUNCT__ outmod regul and tax __PUNCT__ becaus he never work in on himself __PUNCT__
and when he put togeth hi cabinet __PUNCT__ he nearli exclud anyon who had ever work in a real busi __PUNCT__
it shouldn't be a surpris __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ that even when he tri to help __PUNCT__ he sometim make thing wors __PUNCT__
i visit the amoskeag busi incub in manchest a few week ago __PUNCT__
on entrepreneur said that it becom almost imposs to find invest capit becaus now that the obama administr is plai ventur capitalist __PUNCT__ everyon want a govern guarante befor thei will invest __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ when the govern get into a market __PUNCT__ instead of help the market __PUNCT__ it hurt it __PUNCT__ by scare the privat sector awai __PUNCT__
govern should make the rule __PUNCT__ but it shouldn't be on of the player __PUNCT__
i have to tell you how impress i wa with those new hampshir entrepreneur at the incub __PUNCT__ by the wai __PUNCT__
thei were pioneer everyth from solar energi __PUNCT__ to militari acoust __PUNCT__ to consum product __PUNCT__
thei and peopl like them ar who creat the job that put peopl back to work __PUNCT__
and when govern get in their wai or tax awai their success __PUNCT__ govern kill job __PUNCT__
that what happen __PUNCT__ and that on reason so mani peopl ar still out of work __PUNCT__
now let talk a moment about someth els that keep employ and entrepreneur from creat job __PUNCT__
and that the grow fear about the feder deficit and the feder debt __PUNCT__
thei worri that our govern spend bing will mean higher tax __PUNCT__ higher interest rate __PUNCT__ and a much weaker dollar __PUNCT__
peopl don't invest for the long term if the long term look sick __PUNCT__
to see more good job __PUNCT__ we need to see fiscal respons in washington __PUNCT__
on wai to do that would be to establish a ceil on feder spend at a fix percent of the gdp __PUNCT__ histor __PUNCT__ that number ha rang between __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ washington is spend close to __NUM__ __PUNCT__
a spend limit would mean that the politician would have to cut their free __PUNCT__ spend wai __PUNCT__
republican ar fight to do just that by cut discretionari spend __PUNCT__
that import and it a good start __PUNCT__
but it just babi step __PUNCT__ becaus discretionari spend is about __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the budget __PUNCT__
the militari is anoth __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and given what happen in the world __PUNCT__ we should not reduc our commit to nation secur __PUNCT__
in particular __PUNCT__ we should not cut the number of our men and women in uniform __PUNCT__
so that leav __NUM__ __PUNCT__ the lion share __PUNCT__
and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ is what govern spend on entitl and interest __PUNCT__ social secur __PUNCT__ medicaid __PUNCT__ medicar __PUNCT__ and the new entitl __PUNCT__ obamacar __PUNCT__
obamacar ha to be repeal and the other program have to be made sustain __PUNCT__
last year in my book __PUNCT__ i describ how i would do just that __PUNCT__
here the bottom line __PUNCT__ the longer we delai __PUNCT__ the wors thing will get __PUNCT__
if we re __PUNCT__ shape each of these program todai __PUNCT__ and repeal obamacar __PUNCT__ we can honor our promis to senior __PUNCT__ and protect our economi as well __PUNCT__
when presid obama wa elect __PUNCT__ the economi wa in crisi __PUNCT__
and in crisi __PUNCT__ he turn to a model in which he realli believ __PUNCT__
it wasn't the new hampshir model __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ he turn to europ __PUNCT__
like the european __PUNCT__ he grew the govern __PUNCT__ he rack up bigger deficit __PUNCT__ he push cap and trade __PUNCT__ he fought to impos union on america worker __PUNCT__ and he creat over a hundr new board __PUNCT__ agenc and commiss and ream of new regul __PUNCT__
at everi turn __PUNCT__ he and hi fellow liber sought to seiz more power for washington __PUNCT__
and in that caus __PUNCT__ noth wa more misguid and egregi than obamacar __PUNCT__
live in new hampshir __PUNCT__ you heard of our healthcar program next door in massachusett __PUNCT__
you mai have notic that the presid and hi peopl spend more time talk about me and massachusett healthcar than entertain tonight spend talk about charli sheen __PUNCT__
our approach wa a state plan intend to address problem that were in mani wai uniqu to massachusett __PUNCT__
what we did wa what the constitut intend for state to do __PUNCT__ we were on of the laboratori of democraci __PUNCT__
our experi wasn't perfect __PUNCT__ some thing work __PUNCT__ some didn't __PUNCT__ and some thing i chang __PUNCT__
on thing i would never do is to usurp the constitut power of state with a on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit __PUNCT__ all feder takeov __PUNCT__
i would repeal obamacar __PUNCT__ if i were ever in a posit to do so __PUNCT__
my experi ha taught me that state ar where healthcar program for the uninsur should be craft __PUNCT__ just as the constitut provid __PUNCT__
obamacar is bad law __PUNCT__ bad polici __PUNCT__ and it is bad for america famili __PUNCT__
the feder govern isn't the answer for run healthcar ani more than it the answer for run amtrak or the post offic __PUNCT__
an economi run by the feder govern doesn't work for europ and it won't work here __PUNCT__
the right answer is not to believ in european solut __PUNCT__
the right answer is to believ in america __PUNCT__ to believ in freedom __PUNCT__ free enterpris __PUNCT__ capit __PUNCT__ limit govern __PUNCT__ feder __PUNCT__ and to believ in the constitut __PUNCT__ as it wa written and intend by the founder __PUNCT__
my father never graduat from colleg __PUNCT__
he apprent __PUNCT__ as a lath and plaster carpent __PUNCT__ and he wa darn good at it __PUNCT__
he learn how to put a hand of nail in hi mouth and spit them out __PUNCT__ point forward __PUNCT__
on hi honeymoon __PUNCT__ he and mom drove across the countri __PUNCT__
dad sold aluminum paint along the wai __PUNCT__ to pai for ga and hotel __PUNCT__
dad alwai believ in america __PUNCT__ and in that america __PUNCT__ a lath and plaster man could work hi wai up to run a littl car compani call american motor and end up governor of a state where he had onc sold aluminum paint __PUNCT__
for my dad __PUNCT__ america wa the land of opportun __PUNCT__ where the circumst of birth ar no barrier to achiev on dream __PUNCT__
in dad america __PUNCT__ small busi and entrepreneur were encourag __PUNCT__ and respect __PUNCT__
the spirit of enterpris __PUNCT__ innov __PUNCT__ pioneer and der __PUNCT__ do propel our standard of live and economi past everi other nation on earth __PUNCT__
i refus to believ that america is just anoth place on the map with a flag __PUNCT__
we stand for freedom and opportun and hope __PUNCT__
we didn't origin the concept of liberti __PUNCT__ but our found father built it into a polit system that set an exampl for the world __PUNCT__
and from the bloodi sand of omaha beach to the treacher vallei of the hindu kush __PUNCT__ we have battl with unmatch courag and determin __PUNCT__ not to conquer territori __PUNCT__ but to give other the chanc to experi the liberti that is human destini __PUNCT__
given all that america ha done to lift other from poverti __PUNCT__ given the million of afflict we have help to heal and comfort __PUNCT__ and given the hundr of thousand of live of america son and daughter that have been __PUNCT__ and ar todai __PUNCT__ sacrif to defend freedom __PUNCT__ i will not apolog for america __PUNCT__
i don't apolog for america becaus i believ in america __PUNCT__
these last two year have not been the best of time __PUNCT__
but while we lost a coupl of year __PUNCT__ we have not lost our wai __PUNCT__
the principl that made us a great nation and leader of the world have not lost their mean __PUNCT__
thei never will __PUNCT__
the societi that foster opportun and free enterpris __PUNCT__ and put prosper in the reach of all __PUNCT__ still exist __PUNCT__
treasur it and safeguard it is fundament what conservat is all about __PUNCT__
we sing for god to bless america __PUNCT__
