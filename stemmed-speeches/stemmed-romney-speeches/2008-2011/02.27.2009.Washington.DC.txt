my publish ha been talk to me about an __NUM__ __PUNCT__ millon __PUNCT__ dollar deal as well __PUNCT__
i just not sure i can come up with that kind of monei __PUNCT__
it an honor to be introduc by david keen __PUNCT__
hi commit to conserv principl ha been test and proven __PUNCT__ in mani venu and over mani year __PUNCT__
some of you were here with dave for the veri first meet of cpac in the 1970 __PUNCT__
you been involv long enough to know that like everi great caus in america __PUNCT__ the conserv movement ha period of success and moment of setback __PUNCT__
and in __NUM__ we had more than our share of disappoint __PUNCT__
but we haven't come to cpac to dwell on battl we lost __PUNCT__
we ar here to get readi for the battl we go to win __PUNCT__
as conserv __PUNCT__ we face thi new year with resolv __PUNCT__ but without resent __PUNCT__
our countri ha a new presid __PUNCT__ and he ha our prayer and best wish __PUNCT__
in the last eight year __PUNCT__ we saw how a presid polit adversari could be consum by anger __PUNCT__ and even hatr __PUNCT__
that is not the spirit that bring us togeth __PUNCT__
we want our countri to succe __PUNCT__ no matter who in power __PUNCT__
we want america to be prosper and secur __PUNCT__ regardless of who get the credit __PUNCT__
at our best __PUNCT__ that ha alwai been the mark of the conserv movement __PUNCT__ in good time and bad __PUNCT__ the interest of thi great nation come first __PUNCT__
right now the interest of america will depend in mani wai on the decis of presid obama __PUNCT__
those choic ar hi to make __PUNCT__ whether or not we see ey to ey __PUNCT__
we won't be afraid to disagre with him when we must __PUNCT__
and we won't be afraid to agre with him when we can __PUNCT__
on thing the presid can know is that when he take strong action in defens of the unit state __PUNCT__ we will stand by him __PUNCT__
and we will alwai support the brave men and women of our nation militari that he now command __PUNCT__
we make these commit out of principl __PUNCT__ and our principl don't depend on elect won or lost __PUNCT__
contrari to what you hear from some comment on the left __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ elect did veri littl to settl the most seriou differ of opinion in american polit __PUNCT__
some of those issu were hardli debat at all in the fall campaign __PUNCT__
as conserv in opposit __PUNCT__ we have a duti to press on __PUNCT__ a duti to state our case with confid __PUNCT__
some critic speak as if we need to redefin conservat __PUNCT__
i think that miss the mark __PUNCT__
america challeng ar differ from year to year __PUNCT__ but our defin principl remain the same __PUNCT__
conserv don't enter each new polit era try to figur out what we believ __PUNCT__
face new and complex problem __PUNCT__ we find the answer in principl that endur __PUNCT__
ronald reagan us to sai that __PUNCT__ the troubl with our liber friend is not that thei ar ignor __PUNCT__ but that what thei know is wrong __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ conserv don't claim to know everyth __PUNCT__ but what we know is right __PUNCT__
conserv believ in settl great question the wai the founder intend __PUNCT__ especi where the stake ar the highest __PUNCT__
court that have undermin the fundament right to life have shown an equal disregard for the right of properti and the right of religi freedom __PUNCT__
we even seen them extend right to terrorist combat who have kill american and who would like to kill mani more __PUNCT__
in the wai of judici nomine __PUNCT__ these next four year aren't like to be encourag __PUNCT__
but we conserv stand for caus that ar too import to allow unelect judg to forc their own bias on an unwil nation __PUNCT__
we mai not alwai win at the poll __PUNCT__ but we believ in democraci __PUNCT__ we respect the will of the peopl __PUNCT__ and across thi countri __PUNCT__ we will not stand idli by as liber judg try to re __PUNCT__ write the constitut and overrid democraci __PUNCT__
i often ask these dai what republican and conserv have to do to recov __PUNCT__
and i bet my answer is the same as your __PUNCT__
our first concern isn't a polit recoveri __PUNCT__ it the recoveri of our countri __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ re at on of those rare moment in histori __PUNCT__ when the biggest test come all at onc __PUNCT__
we don't have the luxuri of take them on on by on __PUNCT__
we have to get a lot of thing right __PUNCT__ and all at the same time __PUNCT__
we in the second year of a major recess __PUNCT__ and if we don't make the right choic __PUNCT__ thing could get wors __PUNCT__
american have alreadi lost some __NUM__ trillion dollar in net worth __PUNCT__
and the pool of our nation invest capit ha also shrunk by trillion of dollar __PUNCT__
the presid ha alreadi move to stop our economi downward spiral __PUNCT__
part of the stimulu will __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ do some good __PUNCT__
but too much of the bill wa short __PUNCT__ sight and wast __PUNCT__
everi singl republican in congress vote in favor of a better stimulu plan __PUNCT__ on that focus on creat job immedi __PUNCT__
but congression democrat couldn't restrain themselv from lard up their bill with ten of billion of dollar for their polit friend __PUNCT__
republican want to stimul the economi __PUNCT__ democrat want to stimul the govern __PUNCT__
conserv in the hous and senat stood their ground and vote no __PUNCT__ and thei were absolut right __PUNCT__
so far __PUNCT__ the administr ha been unclear on what it will do to address the huge declin in the pool of risk and invest capit __PUNCT__
these loss will be felt in busi that don't start __PUNCT__ up and grow __PUNCT__ and in job that don't get creat __PUNCT__
to grow the pool of invest capit __PUNCT__ the last thing you do is to rais tax on invest __PUNCT__ as the presid ha propos __PUNCT__
the surest __PUNCT__ most obviou cours is to rule out higher tax on invest __PUNCT__
i would propos go on step further __PUNCT__
for all middl __PUNCT__ class american __PUNCT__ we ought to abolish the tax on interest __PUNCT__ dividend and capit gain __PUNCT__
thi econom crisi ha proven that govern ha an urgent oblig to address some aw abus we seen in the financi sector __PUNCT__ particularli in hous financ __PUNCT__
free market __PUNCT__ properli regul and allow to work as thei should __PUNCT__ have propel america to be the largest economi in the world __PUNCT__
for year __PUNCT__ washington politician did noth to prevent the abus at fanni and freddi __PUNCT__ and in some case thei encourag those abus for polit gain __PUNCT__
let be clear on thi point __PUNCT__ conserv favor clear __PUNCT__ streamlin and up __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ date regul and law that let the economi work __PUNCT__ but we will vigor oppos those politician who ar pois to us their own failur as an excus to undermin the free enterpris system __PUNCT__
i know we didn't all agre on tarp __PUNCT__
i believ that it wa necessari to prevent a cascad of bank collaps __PUNCT__
for free market to work __PUNCT__ there ha to be a currenc and a function financi system __PUNCT__
but we can agre on thi __PUNCT__ tarp should not have been us to bail out gm __PUNCT__ chrysler and the uaw __PUNCT__
and thi is person for me __PUNCT__ i want the u __PUNCT__ s __PUNCT__ auto industri to succe __PUNCT__
but as some of us point out last __DATE__ __PUNCT__ that can onli happen if it excess cost and burden ar restructur __PUNCT__
and concess ar go to be few and far between if bondhold and union alreadi have your monei when the negoti begin __PUNCT__
the right answer for detroit is thi __PUNCT__ fix it first __PUNCT__
all of these measur ar meant to confront the current econom peril __PUNCT__
properli guid __PUNCT__ washington could in fact speed the recoveri __PUNCT__
so far __PUNCT__ some of the action it ha taken will help __PUNCT__ and some will hurt __PUNCT__
but we can be certain that the american economi will recov __PUNCT__
the invis hand of the market is more power than the lumber machineri of govern __PUNCT__
in the final analysi __PUNCT__ we know that the privat sector __PUNCT__ entrepreneur and busi larg and small __PUNCT__ will creat the million of job our countri need __PUNCT__
earlier thi week __PUNCT__ the presid address not onli the current economi __PUNCT__ but also hi broader goal __PUNCT__
i wa pleas that he put healthcar __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ and energi on the agenda __PUNCT__
the direct we take on these issu will profoundli shape the futur of the nation __PUNCT__
i afraid i know where the liber democrat want to take us __PUNCT__
and as thei try to pull us in the direct of govern __PUNCT__ domin europ __PUNCT__ we go to have to fight as never befor to make sure that america stai america __PUNCT__
presid obama wa awfulli vagu about some of hi plan __PUNCT__ but i think i heard him sai that govern is respons for educ a child from birth __PUNCT__ from birth __PUNCT__ to it first job __PUNCT__
univers pre __PUNCT__ school and univers colleg __PUNCT__
and there were hint as well of univers healthcar and a univers servic corp __PUNCT__
it all sound veri appeal __PUNCT__ until you realiz that these plan mean univers govern __PUNCT__
that model ha never work anywher in the world __PUNCT__
america is great becaus our societi is free and the power of govern is limit by the constitut __PUNCT__
for the last sever year __PUNCT__ we heard liber moan about the __NUM__ billion dollar that have been spent over six year to win freedom in iraq __PUNCT__
thei have now spent more than that in __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
and with a govern almost __NUM__ trillion dollar in debt __PUNCT__ ani unnecessari spend put at risk the creditworthi of the unit state __PUNCT__
if the world lose confid in our currenc __PUNCT__ that could caus a run on the dollar __PUNCT__ or hyperinfl that would wipe out save and devast the middl class __PUNCT__
presid obama sai he hope to cut the deficit in half after four year __PUNCT__ doe that mean a deficit in __NUM__ of __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__ no presid should accept such a stagger deficit __PUNCT__ much less hold it up as a nation goal __PUNCT__
thi is the time to pare back govern spend __PUNCT__
it is not the time to fulfil everi liber dream and spend america into catastroph __PUNCT__
congression democrat ar gear up to take over the health care system __PUNCT__
we need to advanc a conserv plan __PUNCT__ on base on free choic __PUNCT__ person respons __PUNCT__ and privat medicin __PUNCT__ on that doesn't add massiv new feder spend __PUNCT__
i like what i propos in massachusett when i wa governor __PUNCT__
and even though the final bill and it implement aren't exactli the wai i want __PUNCT__ the plan is a good model __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ almost everi massachusett citizen who had been uninsur now ha privat __PUNCT__ free __PUNCT__ market coverag __PUNCT__ and we didn't have to rais tax or borrow monei to make it happen __PUNCT__
we mai find even better idea in other state __PUNCT__
but let make certain that conserv principl ar front and center __PUNCT__
a big __PUNCT__ govern takeov of health care is the next thing liber ar go to try __PUNCT__ and it the last thing america need __PUNCT__
what america doe need is a commit to reform entitl __PUNCT__
i believ that medicaid should be cap and put in the hand of the state __PUNCT__ social secur benefit for high incom citizen who ar now ag __NUM__ or younger __PUNCT__ should grow with the consum price index __PUNCT__ not the wage index __PUNCT__ and medicar should be reform with a dose of free __PUNCT__ market realiti __PUNCT__
these and other reform ar essenti __PUNCT__ becaus if we stai on the same road __PUNCT__ the next gener could see tax rate __NUM__ percent higher even than our __PUNCT__ and that to pai the bill we rack up for ourselv __PUNCT__
pass on that kind of debt to our children is not onli fiscal irrespons __PUNCT__ it is moral wrong __PUNCT__
i wa glad that the presid said he favor charter school __PUNCT__
did you hear what sound came from the democrat side of the chamber __PUNCT__ cricket __PUNCT__
i hope the presid will join all of us to expand school choic __PUNCT__ reward better teacher with better pai __PUNCT__ rais teacher standard in academ subject __PUNCT__ matter like math and scienc __PUNCT__ and enabl school district to remov teacher that don't make the grade __PUNCT__
it is high time to put america kid first and leav the union boss behind __PUNCT__
we and the presid agre that america must act to becom energi independ __PUNCT__
but hi cap __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ trade propos is exactli the wrong wai to go about it __PUNCT__
it would tax american citizen and employ and send busi and job to high pollut and high emit nation like china __PUNCT__
ani carbon plan ha to be worldwid in scope __PUNCT__ thei don't call it america __PUNCT__ warm __PUNCT__ thei call it global __PUNCT__ warm __PUNCT__
let also be the voic that defend the right of worker __PUNCT__ against coercion and intimid __PUNCT__
the work peopl of thi countri should be abl to union the wai their father and mother did __PUNCT__ by free choic and secret ballot __PUNCT__
the democrat __PUNCT__ plan to take awai those right is an insult to the digniti and common sens of work peopl __PUNCT__
it would be calamit for the economi __PUNCT__
i know that the democrat want to pai back the union boss for all the monei thei gave them __PUNCT__ but thei must not do it by sell out the american worker __PUNCT__ and democraci __PUNCT__
america vote for chang __PUNCT__
america did not vote for a boat __PUNCT__ load of new govern spend program that would guarante higher tax and high deficit as far as the ey can see and that would threaten our currenc __PUNCT__ our economi __PUNCT__ and our futur __PUNCT__
we must be the altern cours __PUNCT__
we can't be that if all we sai is no __PUNCT__
our plan must be clear __PUNCT__ compel __PUNCT__ and first to the tabl __PUNCT__
our plan must have at least on common thread __PUNCT__ thei must make america stronger __PUNCT__
better educ strengthen our kid __PUNCT__ better healthcar strengthen our citizen __PUNCT__ and bring our budget into balanc strengthen our economi and preserv our futur __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ as much as ever __PUNCT__ conserv principl ar absolut essenti to keep america strong and prosper and free __PUNCT__
with all that is happen here at home __PUNCT__ there ar some who have forgotten that we ar at war __PUNCT__ that iran and it jihadist surrog ar kill our son and daughter abroad __PUNCT__ and hope to do it here __PUNCT__
i am pleas that our troop will be come home from iraq __PUNCT__
but let there be no confus __PUNCT__ it is in spite of barack obama stanc on iraq __PUNCT__ not becaus of it __PUNCT__ that the troop ar come home in victori __PUNCT__
presid obama is bare a month into hi term __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ hi biggest decis on nation secur ar still ahead of him __PUNCT__
hi administr ha won the favor of liber comment by pledg what it call reform in the treatment of terrorist detaine __PUNCT__
he also promis to close down guantanamo __PUNCT__ without give the slightest indic of the next stop for the killer be held there now __PUNCT__
that decis __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ ha receiv the predict applaus from certain law professor and editori board __PUNCT__
but here the problem __PUNCT__
that is the veri kind of think that left america vulner to the attack of __DATE__ __PUNCT__
thi is not a law enforc problem __PUNCT__
it is the gravest matter of nation secur __PUNCT__ with thousand if not million of live in the balanc __PUNCT__
the jihadist ar still at war with america __PUNCT__
our govern ha no greater duti than a vigil defens __PUNCT__ and no greater caus than victori for america and for freedom __PUNCT__
i had no object when barack obama decid to give hi first tv interview to an arab broadcast __PUNCT__
but when he said that america in the past ha dictat to the world __PUNCT__ he wa misguid and naïv __PUNCT__
and the next time our presid speak to a foreign audienc i hope he will rememb thi basic fact of histori __PUNCT__ america is not a countri that dictat to other nation __PUNCT__
we ar the countri that ha freed million of peopl from the tyranni of dictat __PUNCT__
never in the histori of a world ha a singl countri possess such great power __PUNCT__ and us it for such good purpos across the world __PUNCT__ as the unit state of america __PUNCT__
i believ presid obama wa also mistaken in back awai from our commit to missil defens __PUNCT__
and if he calcul that russia would respond in kind by show a littl restraint and good will __PUNCT__ he quickli learn otherwis __PUNCT__
all russia did to return the favor wa bribe kyrgyzstan to shut down our us of it airport __PUNCT__ close access we need for our troop serv in afghanistan __PUNCT__
gestur that commun a lack of resolv onli embolden america adversari __PUNCT__
with iran seek nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ with north korea alreadi nuclear and sell it technolog to the syrian __PUNCT__ it is essenti that we construct a missil defens __PUNCT__ now __PUNCT__
a lot of you have the memori of come to cpac in it earli dai __PUNCT__ when america had challeng so big that mani in the world __PUNCT__ and even a few in our own govern __PUNCT__ thought we were in declin __PUNCT__
thei doubt our abil to compet econom __PUNCT__ to face down the danger of the era __PUNCT__ or even to defend our ideal __PUNCT__
todai we hear echo of that era onc again __PUNCT__ from those who speak of america as if our dai ha pass __PUNCT__
some of these critic never care much for our belief that america occupi a special place __PUNCT__ that there is work in the world that onli we can do __PUNCT__ and that american have the heart and the courag to get it done __PUNCT__
but we know these thing to be true __PUNCT__
and to those who question the charact of our countri __PUNCT__ includ the new attornei gener __PUNCT__ let us remind them that america ha never been __PUNCT__ is not now __PUNCT__ and will never be a nation of coward __PUNCT__
i don't deni that america challeng ar great __PUNCT__ or that overcom them will requir the best that we have to give __PUNCT__
but i know as well that time of difficulti alwai bring out the essenti charact of our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
when i wa a boi __PUNCT__ my dad us to sai that the pursuit of the difficult make you strong __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ the pursuit of the difficult will make america strong __PUNCT__
we welcom the challeng __PUNCT__
it will call on us __PUNCT__ onc again __PUNCT__ to draw on the incred resili __PUNCT__ ingenu __PUNCT__ and faith of the free men and women of america __PUNCT__
we don't get to choos the test and trial ahead __PUNCT__
but we entir free __PUNCT__ you and i __PUNCT__ to choos how we will meet those test __PUNCT__
we will meet them as conserv have done befor __PUNCT__
we will find strength in each other __PUNCT__ and answer our oppon with good will and honest word __PUNCT__
and we will go forward __PUNCT__ confid in our belief __PUNCT__ and certain of victori to come __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
