it often said that the presid of the unit state is the toughest job in the world __PUNCT__
fair enough __PUNCT__
undoubtedli true __PUNCT__

the presid who took offic on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __NUM__ should have had on central mission __PUNCT__ put american back to work __PUNCT__ fight for everi job __PUNCT__ becaus everi job is a paycheck and paycheck fuel american dream __PUNCT__
without a paycheck __PUNCT__ you can't take care of your famili __PUNCT__
without a paycheck you can't bui school book for your kid __PUNCT__ keep a car on the road or help an ag parent make end meet __PUNCT__
presid barack obama ha stood watch over the greatest job loss in modern american histori __PUNCT__
and that __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ is on inconveni truth that will haunt thi presid throughout histori __PUNCT__

todai miseri is real unemploy __PUNCT__ home foreclosur and bankruptci __PUNCT__
thi is the obama miseri index __PUNCT__ and it at a record high __PUNCT__
it go to take more than new rhetor to put american back to work __PUNCT__ it go to take a new presid __PUNCT__
