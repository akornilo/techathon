thei won __PUNCT__ we lost __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ you learn a lot about peopl when you see how thei react to lose __PUNCT__
we didn't serv up excus or blame our fellow citizen __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ we listen to the american peopl __PUNCT__ we sharpen our think and our argument __PUNCT__ we spoke with greater persuas __PUNCT__ we took our messag to more journal and airwav __PUNCT__ and in the american tradit __PUNCT__ some even brought attent to our caus with ralli and tea parti __PUNCT__
i know that most of you have watch intent as the conserv comeback began in virginia and explod onto the scene in new jersei __PUNCT__
but as a massachusett man __PUNCT__ who __PUNCT__ like my fellow bai __PUNCT__ stater __PUNCT__ ha over the year __PUNCT__ been understand regard somewhat suspici in gather like thi __PUNCT__ let me take just a moment to exalt in a scott brown victori __PUNCT__
for that victori that stop obama __PUNCT__ care and turn back the reid __PUNCT__ pelosi liber tide __PUNCT__ we have someth to that you never think you hear at cpac __PUNCT__ thank you massachusett __PUNCT__
__NUM__ wa the presid turn to suffer loss __PUNCT__ and not just at the ballot box __PUNCT__ but also in bill after bill in congress __PUNCT__ and most importantli __PUNCT__ in hi failur to reignit the economi __PUNCT__
in how he ha respond to these defeat __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__ we have learn a great about him and about hi team __PUNCT__
he began by claim that he had not fail at all __PUNCT__
rememb the b __SYMBOL__ grade he gave himself for hi first year __PUNCT__ tell that to the __NUM__ million american who lost their job last year __PUNCT__ and to the million more who stop look __PUNCT__
explain that to the world financi market who gape at trillion dollar deficit as far as the ey can see __PUNCT__
squar that with the absenc of ani meaning sanction against iran even as it fund terror and race to becom a nuclear nation __PUNCT__
presid obama self __PUNCT__ proclaim b __SYMBOL__ will go down in histori as the biggest exagger sinc al gore invent of the internet __PUNCT__
unabl to convinc us that hi failur wa a success __PUNCT__ he turn to the second dodg of lose team __PUNCT__ try to pin the blame on someon els __PUNCT__
did you see hi state of the union address __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ he took on the on group in the room that wa restrain from respond __PUNCT__ the suprem court __PUNCT__
the presid found it inexplic that the first amend right of free speech should be guarante not just to labor union corpor and media corpor __PUNCT__ but equal to all corpor __PUNCT__ big and small __PUNCT__
when it wa all over __PUNCT__ i think most american felt as i did __PUNCT__ hi noisi critiqu and bombast did not regist as clear and convincingli as justic alito silent lip form these word __PUNCT__ not true __PUNCT__
next he blame the republican in the room __PUNCT__ condescend to lectur them on the work of the budget process __PUNCT__ a process mani of them had in fact master while he wa still at harvard law school __PUNCT__
he blame republican for the gridlock that ha block hi favorit legisl __PUNCT__ but he know as well as we do that he did not need on singl solitari republican vote in either hous to pass hi legisl __PUNCT__
it wa democrat who block him __PUNCT__ democrat who said __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ to hi liber agenda after thei had been home to their district and heard from the american peopl __PUNCT__
as everett dirksen us to sai __PUNCT__ when thei felt the heat __PUNCT__ thei saw the light __PUNCT__ god bless everi american who said no __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ the presid accus us of be the parti of __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ it as if he think that sai __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ is by definit a bad thing __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ it is right and praiseworthi to sai no to bad thing __PUNCT__
it is right to sai no to cap and trade __PUNCT__ no to card check __PUNCT__ no to govern healthcar __PUNCT__ and no to higher tax __PUNCT__
my parti should never be a rubber stamp for rubber check spend __PUNCT__
but befor we move awai from thi __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ epithet the democrat ar fond of appli to us __PUNCT__ let ask the obama folk why thei sai __PUNCT__ no __PUNCT__ no to a balanc budget __PUNCT__ no to reform entitl __PUNCT__ no to malpractic reform __PUNCT__ no to missil defens in eastern europ __PUNCT__ no to prosecut khalid sheikh moham in a militari tribun __PUNCT__ and no to tax cut that creat new job __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ we conserv don't have a corner on sai no __PUNCT__ we just the on who sai it when that the right thing to do __PUNCT__
and that lead us to who he ha most recent charg with culpabl for hi failur __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__
it seem that we have fail to understand hi wise plan for us __PUNCT__
if he just slow down __PUNCT__ he reason __PUNCT__ and make a concert effort to explain obama __PUNCT__ care in a wai even we can understand __PUNCT__ if we just listen better __PUNCT__ then we will get it __PUNCT__
actual __PUNCT__ american have been listen quit attent __PUNCT__
and thei have been watch __PUNCT__
when he bar cspan from cover the healthcar deliber __PUNCT__ thei saw presid obama break hi promis of transpar __PUNCT__
when the democrat leadership wa empow to bribe nebraska senat nelson __PUNCT__ thei saw presid obama break hi promis of a new kind of polit in washington __PUNCT__
and when he cut a special and certainli unconstitut healthcar deal with the union __PUNCT__ thei saw him not just break hi promis __PUNCT__ thei saw the most blatant and reprehens manifest of polit payoff in modern memori __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ the american peopl didn't hear and see too littl __PUNCT__ thei saw too much __PUNCT__
here again __PUNCT__ with all due respect __PUNCT__ presid obama fail to understand america __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ with all the lobbi and hors __PUNCT__ trade __PUNCT__ the process left most american wonder __PUNCT__ what in it for me __PUNCT__ that not at all what thei were ask __PUNCT__
thei were ask __PUNCT__ what in it for america __PUNCT__
america will not endur govern run healthcar __PUNCT__ a new and expans entitl __PUNCT__ an inexplic and sure vanish cut in medicar and an even greater burden of tax __PUNCT__
american said no becaus obama __PUNCT__ care is bad care for america __PUNCT__
when it come to shift respons for failur __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ no on is a more frequent object of presid obama reproach than presid bush __PUNCT__
it wear so thin that even the late night show make fun of it __PUNCT__
i am convinc that histori will judg presid bush far more kindli __PUNCT__ he pull us from a deepen recess follow the attack of __NUM__ __PUNCT__ he overcam teacher union to test school children and evalu school __PUNCT__ he took down the taliban __PUNCT__ wage a war against the jihadist and wa not afraid to call it what it is __PUNCT__ a war __PUNCT__ and he kept us safe __PUNCT__
i respect hi silenc even in the face of the assault on hi record that come from thi administr __PUNCT__
but at the same time __PUNCT__ i also respect the loyalti and indefatig defens of truth that come from our __PUNCT__ i don't give a damn __PUNCT__ vice presid dick chenei __PUNCT__
i afraid that after all the finger point is finish __PUNCT__ it ha becom clear who is respons for presid obama lost year __PUNCT__ the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ unemploy year __PUNCT__ presid obama and hi fellow democrat __PUNCT__
so when it come to pin blame __PUNCT__ pin the tail on the donkei __PUNCT__
there a good deal of conjectur about the caus of presid obama failur __PUNCT__
as he frequent remind us __PUNCT__ he assum the presid at a difficult time __PUNCT__
that the reason we argu dure the campaign that these were not the time for on the job train __PUNCT__
had he or hi advisor spent even a few year in the real economi __PUNCT__ thei would have learn that the number on caus of failur in the privat sector is lack of focu __PUNCT__ and that the first rule of turn around ani troubl enterpris is focu __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__ focu __PUNCT__
and so __PUNCT__ when he assum the presid __PUNCT__ hi energi should have been focus on fix the economi and creat job __PUNCT__ and to succeed in our fight against radic violent jihad in iraq and afghanistan __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ he appli hi time and polit capit to hi ill __PUNCT__ conceiv healthcar takeov and to build hi person popular in foreign countri __PUNCT__
he fail to focu __PUNCT__ and so he fail __PUNCT__
but there wa an even bigger problem than lack of focu __PUNCT__
ronald reagan us to sai thi about liber __PUNCT__ it not that thei ignor __PUNCT__ it that what thei know is wrong __PUNCT__ too often __PUNCT__ when it came to what presid obama knew __PUNCT__ he wa wrong __PUNCT__
he correctli acknowledg that the govern doesn't creat job __PUNCT__ that onli the privat sector can do that __PUNCT__
he said that the govern can creat the condit __PUNCT__ the environ __PUNCT__ which lead the privat sector to add employ __PUNCT__
but consid not what he said __PUNCT__ but what he did last year __PUNCT__ and ask whether it help or hurt the environ for invest __PUNCT__ growth __PUNCT__ and new job __PUNCT__
announc __NUM__ tax increas for individu and busi and for capit gain __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
pass cap and trade __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
give trial lawyer a free pass __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
propos card check to elimin secret ballot in union elect __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
hold on to gm stock and insist on call the shot there __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
make a grab for healthcar __PUNCT__ almost 1/5th of our economi __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
budget govern deficit in the trillion __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
and scapego and demon businesspeopl __PUNCT__ hurt __PUNCT__
presid obama institut the most anti __PUNCT__ growth __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ invest __PUNCT__ anti __PUNCT__ job measur we seen in our lifetim __PUNCT__
he call hi agenda ambiti __PUNCT__
i call it reckless __PUNCT__
he scare employ __PUNCT__ so job were scarc __PUNCT__
hi nearli trillion dollar stimulu creat not on net new job in the privat sector __PUNCT__ but it save and grew job in the govern sector __PUNCT__ the on place we should have shed job __PUNCT__
and even todai __PUNCT__ becaus he ha been unwil or unabl to defin the road ahead __PUNCT__ uncertainti and lack of predict permeat the privat economi __PUNCT__ and prolong it stall __PUNCT__
america is not better off than it wa __NUM__ trillion dollar ago __PUNCT__
will the economi and unemploy recov __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__
thank to a vibrant and innov citizenri __PUNCT__ thei alwai do __PUNCT__
but thi presid will not deserv the credit he will undoubtedli claim __PUNCT__
he ha prolong the recess __PUNCT__ expand the pain of unemploy __PUNCT__ and ad to the burden of debt we will leav futur gener __PUNCT__
presid obama __PUNCT__ nanci pelosi __PUNCT__ harri reid and their team have fail the american peopl __PUNCT__ and that is why their major will be out the door __PUNCT__
isn't it fit that so mani of those who have contempt for the privat sector will soon find themselv back in it __PUNCT__
the peopl of america ar look to conserv for leadership __PUNCT__ and we must not fail them __PUNCT__
conservat ha had from it incept a vigor posit __PUNCT__ intellectu rigor agenda __PUNCT__
that agenda should have three pillar __PUNCT__ strengthen the economi __PUNCT__ strengthen our secur __PUNCT__ and strengthen our famili __PUNCT__
we will strengthen the economi by simplifi and lower tax __PUNCT__ by replac outmod regul with modern __PUNCT__ dynam regul __PUNCT__ by open market to american good __PUNCT__ by strengthen our currenc and our capit market __PUNCT__ and by invest in research and basic scienc __PUNCT__
instead of lead the world in how much we borrow __PUNCT__ we will make sure that we lead the world in how much we build and creat and invest __PUNCT__
we will strengthen our secur by build missil defens __PUNCT__ restor our militari might __PUNCT__ and stand __PUNCT__ by and strengthen our intellig offic __PUNCT__
and conserv believ in provid constitut right to our citizen __PUNCT__ not to enemi combat like khalid sheikh moham __PUNCT__
on our watch __PUNCT__ the convers with a would __PUNCT__ be suicid bomber will not begin with the word __PUNCT__ you have the right to remain silent __PUNCT__
our conserv agenda strengthen our famili in part by put our school on track to be the best in the world __PUNCT__
becaus great school start with great teacher __PUNCT__ we will insist on hire teacher from the top third of colleg graduat __PUNCT__ and we will give better teacher better pai __PUNCT__
school account __PUNCT__ school choic and cyber school will be prioriti __PUNCT__
we will put parent and teacher back in charg of educ __PUNCT__ not the fat cat ceo of the teacher union __PUNCT__
strong famili will have excel healthcar __PUNCT__
get healthcar coverag for the uninsur should be accomplish at the state level __PUNCT__ not a on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit all pelosi plan __PUNCT__
the right wai to rein __PUNCT__ in healthcar cost is not by make it more like the post offic __PUNCT__ it by make it more like a consum __PUNCT__ driven market __PUNCT__
the answer for healthcar is market incent not healthcar by a godzilla __PUNCT__ size govern bureaucraci __PUNCT__
when it come to our role in the world __PUNCT__ our conserv agenda hew to the principl that have defin our nation foreign polici for over six decad __PUNCT__ we will promot and defend the american ideal of polit freedom __PUNCT__ free enterpris __PUNCT__ and human right __PUNCT__

there much more on our posit __PUNCT__ intellectu rigor conserv agenda __PUNCT__
not all of it is popular __PUNCT__
but the american peopl have shown that thei ar readi for truth to trump hope __PUNCT__
the truth is that govern is not the solut to all our problem __PUNCT__
