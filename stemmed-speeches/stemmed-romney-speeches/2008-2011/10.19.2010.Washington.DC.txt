it is for that reason that i flew here todai to speak with you __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
i have been to israel twice __PUNCT__ mostli recent in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i came awai encourag by what i saw __PUNCT__
on that last trip __PUNCT__ i travel __PUNCT__ with some of the peopl in thi room __PUNCT__ by helicopt to al __PUNCT__ fai menasha __PUNCT__
it wa to tour a strateg span in the secur fenc __PUNCT__ stand between the center of israel and the west bank __PUNCT__
it is at that point that on can see just how narrow the waist of israel actual is __PUNCT__
i wa struck dure that tour by the idf offic that wa brief us __PUNCT__
he bent over backward to explain how low and how unobtrus the fenc wa __PUNCT__ how much effort had been expend to keep it from be too impos __PUNCT__
at on point __PUNCT__ i respectfulli interrupt him to explain that he didn't need to apolog __PUNCT__ at least not to thi american __PUNCT__
becaus if america live in a neighborhood like israel __PUNCT__ with suicid bomber cross into our countri to kill children in school buse __PUNCT__ we be build a fenc that wa higher __PUNCT__ thicker and hard as concret __PUNCT__
israel should be proud that it valu the blood of it countrymen __PUNCT__ of it children __PUNCT__ abov the approb of foreign bureaucrat __PUNCT__
dure my last trip __PUNCT__ i wa impress with the busi commun __PUNCT__
as you know __PUNCT__ my career wa in busi __PUNCT__ as a manag consult __PUNCT__ a ventur capitalist and as a privat equiti investor __PUNCT__
while in israel __PUNCT__ we met with entrepreneur and busi peopl __PUNCT__
their ingenu demonstr why it is that israel ha the highest densiti of start __PUNCT__ up in the world __PUNCT__ and more compani on nasdaq than all of india __PUNCT__ china __PUNCT__ korea __PUNCT__ japan __PUNCT__ and europ combin __PUNCT__
i understand that there is talk among some european organ about boycot isra product and bar isra academ __PUNCT__
if thei do __PUNCT__ thei will be punish themselv more than thei hurt israel __PUNCT__
brilliant innov and technolog have alwai been abl to penetr the wall built by the uninform __PUNCT__ protectionist and prejud __PUNCT__ and thei alwai will __PUNCT__
most of all __PUNCT__ i wa impress with the peopl of israel __PUNCT__
that peopl actual immigr to israel __PUNCT__ rather than flee from the threaten and violent neighborhood of the middl east __PUNCT__ is a testament to their courag __PUNCT__ faith and charact __PUNCT__
it is an inspir to an often self __PUNCT__ indulg world __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
america and israel ar bound togeth by common commit and share valu __PUNCT__
we believ in repres democraci and human right __PUNCT__
we believ in the rule of law __PUNCT__ in learn __PUNCT__ scholarship __PUNCT__ and free inquiri __PUNCT__
we believ in the digniti of the human soul and in it god __PUNCT__ given right to ascend abov govern domin __PUNCT__ with freedom to speak __PUNCT__ worship __PUNCT__ associ and think as on desir __PUNCT__
and becaus we share the same valu __PUNCT__ we also share mani of the same adversari __PUNCT__
we reject oppress __PUNCT__ terror __PUNCT__ authoritarian __PUNCT__
violent jihadist have refer to america as the __PUNCT__ great satan __PUNCT__ and to israel as the __PUNCT__ littl satan __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ thei don't recogn the ironi __PUNCT__ commit as thei ar to the imposit of power over other __PUNCT__ to violenc __PUNCT__ to brutal __PUNCT__ to the subjug of women and girl and to bigotri and racism __PUNCT__
israel ha been fight all of these thing from the moment it wa born __PUNCT__
as the unit state carri on that fight in countri scatter across the globe __PUNCT__ we know that israel is america most ardent alli in the middl east __PUNCT__
the world is fast becom a more danger place __PUNCT__
liberti and peac ar threaten in new and fright wai __PUNCT__
russia is return to it authoritarian wai __PUNCT__ fuel by it energi stranglehold on europ __PUNCT__
china ha marri the power of free enterpris with the oppress of communist rule __PUNCT__
violent jihadist ar fight to crush peopl and nation across the globe __PUNCT__
and rogu nation with maniac autocrat ar recklessli pursu nuclear capabl that put the world in jeopardi __PUNCT__
left uncheck __PUNCT__ a nuclear race will be join by mani __PUNCT__ mani other __PUNCT__
for all these reason __PUNCT__ america need strong alli __PUNCT__
thi is on reason why i am so veri concern by the current drift in our govern relationship with israel __PUNCT__
in pursuit of a peac process __PUNCT__ the unit state todai ha exert substanti pressur on israel while put almost no pressur on the palestinian and the arab world __PUNCT__
consid how littl we ask of the arab world __PUNCT__
why is it that onli egypt and jordan have peac agreement with israel __PUNCT__ what about saudi arabia __PUNCT__ the saudi govern will not even sit in the same room as the isra __PUNCT__ let alon normal relat or work toward a realist peac agreement __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ at the height of the olmert __PUNCT__ abba peac track __PUNCT__ the saudi were demand that more u. __PUNCT__ compani compli with their boycott of israel __PUNCT__
israel __PUNCT__ on the other hand __PUNCT__ ha repeatedli demonstr it commit to a last and realist peac __PUNCT__
as you know well __PUNCT__ in __NUM__ for exampl __PUNCT__ israel hand over the gaza strip to the palestinian __PUNCT__
thi gener __PUNCT__ unilater act wa met in return with rocket fire into israel __PUNCT__ with a coup by hama in gaza __PUNCT__ and with two war __PUNCT__ on on the lebanes border and anoth in gaza __PUNCT__
inexplic __PUNCT__ the unit state now place the burden on israel to make still more unilater concess __PUNCT__
at the unit nation __PUNCT__ we decri the build of new isra settlement but ignor the launch of palestinian rocket __PUNCT__
how is thi possibl __PUNCT__ have we not yet learn from the concess in gaza __PUNCT__ as well as from all record histori __PUNCT__ that give in to the demand of oppressor alwai and onli lead to more demand __PUNCT__ not to peac __PUNCT__
we can encourag both parti in the conflict __PUNCT__ but we must never forget which on is our alli __PUNCT__
nor must we forget that hama __PUNCT__ like other violent jihadist __PUNCT__ doe not have a two __PUNCT__ state solut as it object __PUNCT__ it ha the conquest and annihil of israel as it object __PUNCT__
the notion that hama and violent jihadist ar motiv by __PUNCT__ share interest __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ common goal __PUNCT__ is na√Øv in the extrem and danger to the entir free world __PUNCT__
thi is on reason why america must never cede to the unit nation our commit to israel __PUNCT__ our leadership of the free world and our defens of liberti __PUNCT__
i will happili agre that the un ha done some good in it histori __PUNCT__
but i will also insist that it ha also done terribl damag to the caus it claim to uphold __PUNCT__
and on no issu ha it been more irrespons and moral reckless than when consid the fate of israel __PUNCT__
time and time again __PUNCT__ the un ha becom a forum for invect against the jewish state __PUNCT__
we saw it in __NUM__ when the un pass an anti __PUNCT__ semit resolut that condemn israel as racist __PUNCT__
and we have seen it in just the last few week __PUNCT__ when the un gave a platform to a holocaust __PUNCT__ denier who ha pledg over and over again that he will wipe out israel __PUNCT__
it wa a grotesqu moment and anoth stain on the reput of the unit nation __PUNCT__
and congratul to prime minist netanyahu for have the moral courag to sai what need to be said to those member of the unit nation who stai to listen to mahmoud achmadinejad __PUNCT__ have you no shame __PUNCT__
but the outrag did not stop there __PUNCT__
a report __PUNCT__ titl __PUNCT__ unit nation fact find mission on the gaza conflict __PUNCT__ wa the latest in a long line of infam act __PUNCT__
the so __PUNCT__ call goldston report took israel to task for defend itself after be pummel by more than __NUM__ missil fire on israel by hama __PUNCT__
hama not onli wa target innoc civilian __PUNCT__ it wa also us innoc palestinian as human shield __PUNCT__
israel took extraordinari measur to prevent civilian casualti __PUNCT__
yet who did the un human right council see fit to condemn __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__
again __PUNCT__ the word of prime minist netanyahu __PUNCT__ a democraci legitim defend itself against terror is moral hang __PUNCT__ drawn and quarter __PUNCT__ and given an unfair trial to boot __PUNCT__
a world in which america is more attun to the approb of the unit nation than to it alli israel is a world in peril __PUNCT__
mai thi never be so __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
my concern extend to our entir foreign polici __PUNCT__
if the u. __PUNCT__ govern engag tyranni and autocraci __PUNCT__ countri like iran and north korea __PUNCT__ syria and russia __PUNCT__ sudan and zimbabw __PUNCT__ base on the convict that we ar deal with common interest more than compet interest __PUNCT__ it will not end well __PUNCT__
dean acheson __PUNCT__ presid truman secretari of state __PUNCT__ offer wise and time counsel __PUNCT__
follow the __NUM__ world war __PUNCT__ america had recogn that not everi power on thi planet share our goal and valu __PUNCT__
and thi realiz is what shape the foreign polici that ha guid us for __NUM__ or so year __PUNCT__
truman __PUNCT__ he said __PUNCT__ had been __PUNCT__ releas from the accept of a dogma that builder and wrecker of a new world order could and should work happili and successfulli togeth __PUNCT__ truman __PUNCT__ wa free to combin our power and coordin our action with those who did have a common purpos __PUNCT__
our approach to intern relat must continu to adher to the vision of truman and acheson __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we should treat our alli like the alli thei ar __PUNCT__
that mean __PUNCT__ for starter __PUNCT__ not be harder on them __PUNCT__ or demand more from them __PUNCT__ than we do from our adversari __PUNCT__
it mean treat them with respect rather than offens __PUNCT__
it mean strive to make their live easier rather than harder __PUNCT__
in short __PUNCT__ we should honor the basic rule that govern state __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ state affair __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ foreign polici commit ar not to be made and unmad at will __PUNCT__ margaret thatcher onc said __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ we cannot expect other to keep their word to us __PUNCT__ unless we keep our word to them __PUNCT__
keep our word to our alli is a matter of honor __PUNCT__ but it is also a matter of self __PUNCT__ interest __PUNCT__
the unit state need alli for econom __PUNCT__ polit __PUNCT__ and nation secur reason __PUNCT__
good alli and strong allianc allow us to share the burden we carri __PUNCT__ complement and supplement our effort __PUNCT__ and present a unit front against those who wish us harm __PUNCT__
when we treat ani alli in a desultori manner __PUNCT__ and especi if we act in a wai that caus them to question our reliabl __PUNCT__ our resolv __PUNCT__ our commit and stai power __PUNCT__ then thei as well as our other alli __PUNCT__ all of whom ar watch veri close __PUNCT__ will turn to other for their secur __PUNCT__
when poland and the czech republ ar humili by us __PUNCT__ thei lose confid in america support for them __PUNCT__ and thei mai decid that thei must inclin more toward russia __PUNCT__
if our friend in latin america like colombia becom convinc that we ar turn our back on them __PUNCT__ thei mai feel compel to becom more accommod to hugo chavez __PUNCT__
if japan believ the unit state is weaken it commit in the pacif __PUNCT__ it mai distanc itself from america and draw closer to china __PUNCT__
when defend of democraci and the rule of constitut and law in hondura find that we have side with their pro __PUNCT__ chavez illeg opposit __PUNCT__ freedom fighter across the world __PUNCT__ re __PUNCT__ calcul their chanc for success __PUNCT__
and if arab nation believ that we will accommod iran ambit to domin the middl east with nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ thei will move closer to that veri nation __PUNCT__
whenev or wherev america step awai from on of it friend and alli __PUNCT__ or shrink in the face of belliger tyrant __PUNCT__ those who ar alli with us mai understand or inevit step closer to our foe __PUNCT__
the advanc of human right and the defens of liberti demand that america stand firm with it alli __PUNCT__ all of them __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ i now want to sai more about iran __PUNCT__
the iranian leadership is the greatest immedi threat to the world sinc the fall of the soviet union __PUNCT__ and befor that __PUNCT__ nazi germani __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ ahmadinejad __PUNCT__ ha gone well beyond the boundari of outrag __PUNCT__ begin with hi calcul desecr of histori __PUNCT__
when he deni the holocaust __PUNCT__ he could care less about histori __PUNCT__
hi point is about the present and the futur __PUNCT__
hi purpos is not mere to deni the holocaust __PUNCT__ but also to deni israel __PUNCT__
he is test the water __PUNCT__
he want to know who will object __PUNCT__
and how thei will regist their object __PUNCT__
the iranian regim threaten not onli israel __PUNCT__ but also everi other nation in the region __PUNCT__ and ultim the world __PUNCT__
it is a repress regim __PUNCT__ an intract enemi of liberti and human right __PUNCT__ the world lead sponsor of terror and subvers war __PUNCT__
the threat it pose to the world would take on an entir new dimens if iran were allow to becom a nuclear power __PUNCT__
earlier thi month __PUNCT__ senior staff member of the u.n __PUNCT__ nuclear agenc conclud in a confidenti analysi that iran ha acquir __PUNCT__ suffici inform to be abl to design and produc a workabl __PUNCT__ atom bomb __PUNCT__
we also learn of a previous secret __PUNCT__ illeg uranium enrich facil that the iranian had been hide near qom __PUNCT__
a nuclear iran would be a tip point in the prolifer of nuclear regim __PUNCT__
it is beyond the scope of thi address to provid a detail tactic and strateg approach to iran __PUNCT__ as i endeavor to do at the herzylia confer two year ago __PUNCT__
in that address __PUNCT__ i detail the six critic step that would have to immedi be taken to dissuad iran from nuclear folli __PUNCT__
not a singl on of them ha been taken by america __PUNCT__
at thi late stage i would simpli sai that it is long past time for america to recogn the natur of the regim we ar deal with __PUNCT__
the iranian regim is unalloi evil __PUNCT__ run by peopl who ar at onc ruthless and fanat __PUNCT__
stop think that a charm offens will talk the iranian out of their pursuit of nuclear weapon __PUNCT__
it will not __PUNCT__
and agreement __PUNCT__ unenforc and unverifi __PUNCT__ will have no greater impact here than thei did in north korea __PUNCT__
onc an outstretch hand is met with a clench fist __PUNCT__ it becom a symbol of weak and impot __PUNCT__
presid eisenhow said it well __PUNCT__ the care of freedom is not long entrust to the weak and timid __PUNCT__
the presid of the unit state can emploi hi admir and good will to actual accomplish someth meaning and real in iran __PUNCT__ comprehens __PUNCT__ wither sanction __PUNCT__ diplomat isol __PUNCT__ and intern support for the forc of freedom within iran __PUNCT__
the peopl of iran repres a major sourc of strength __PUNCT__
by and larg __PUNCT__ thei have not been radic by their govern and cleric __PUNCT__ in fact __PUNCT__ the regim effort to crush the upris against it ha onli alien the peopl of iran __PUNCT__
thei fear econom stagnat and thei hate polit repress __PUNCT__
most ar not seek a militari confront with the west __PUNCT__
inde __PUNCT__ most want greater engag with the west __PUNCT__
and the militari option must remain on the tabl __PUNCT__ and that threat need to be credibl __PUNCT__
unfortun __PUNCT__ for reason that ar unfathom to me __PUNCT__ our govern ha signal that the militari option is effect off the tabl __PUNCT__
how can that be countenanc when an alli of the unit state face an existenti threat __PUNCT__
i don't pretend for a moment that the cours of action to take with iran is easi or obviou __PUNCT__ there ar cost to anyth we do __PUNCT__ but there ar even greater cost if we do noth at all __PUNCT__
if we allow iran under the rule of the mullah to get a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ it will make the problem america face todai look like a walk in the park __PUNCT__
the clock is tick __PUNCT__ with no real progress to show for the preciou time that ha alreadi laps __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
earlier i mention presid truman __PUNCT__
i like to end my remark by recount a remark dai in the histori of our two nation __PUNCT__ as told by michael oren __PUNCT__ israel ambassador to the unit state __PUNCT__
he tell how word of israel birth reach washington on __DATE__ __PUNCT__
at that moment __PUNCT__ the armi of egypt __PUNCT__ lebanon __PUNCT__ syria __PUNCT__ and iraq were mobil for war against the nascent state __PUNCT__
the question on everyon mind wa whether the unit state would recogn thi new nation of israel and it self __PUNCT__ proclaim govern __PUNCT__
alon in the white hous __PUNCT__ with much of the world and mani in hi own administr against recogn israel __PUNCT__ truman ponder the ramif of hi decis __PUNCT__
at eleven minut past six in the even __PUNCT__ an administr spokesman appear befor report at the white hous __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ thi govern ha been inform that a jewish state ha been proclaim in palestin and that recognit ha been request by the provision govern thereof __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ read from a print text __PUNCT__ underst the moment of hi messag __PUNCT__ the spokesman said __PUNCT__ the unit state recogn the provision govern as the de facto author of the state of israel __PUNCT__
truman never regret hi decis or the kei role he plai in mid __PUNCT__ wife the birth of the jewish state __PUNCT__
he understood how on everi level __PUNCT__ moral and geopolit __PUNCT__ cultur and histor __PUNCT__ it wa right for america to stand with israel __PUNCT__
harri s __PUNCT__ truman wa a wise and courag presid __PUNCT__ a person of unshak principl __PUNCT__ and a man who help bend histori in the direct of justic __PUNCT__
truman wa a great presid __PUNCT__ in part becaus he wa deepli commit to our friend __PUNCT__ to our nation charact __PUNCT__ and to the state of israel __PUNCT__
as it wa __PUNCT__ let us hope it shall be again __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
