and i don't know whether to admir you for your stamina or compliment you on your be such a glutton for punish __PUNCT__ but i glad you includ me in the mix __PUNCT__
my relationship with you folk can be sum up veri shortli __PUNCT__
check the record __PUNCT__
that about all i probabl need to sai __PUNCT__
but have rejoin the rank of the politician again __PUNCT__ obvious that not all i go to sai __PUNCT__
but i do rememb a relationship from wai back __PUNCT__ from the time that charlton heston came to tennesse in __NUM__ and i form a friendship with that great american and watch him hobbl across the state with me on a bad hip and go through pain to help me win my first elect in the unit state senat __PUNCT__
i think back to the time that i had __PUNCT__ for a while i had a skeet shoot there in nashvil __PUNCT__ mani of you know of __PUNCT__
i met some of you there for the first time __PUNCT__
we rais a littl monei for juvenil diabet __PUNCT__ and then __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ your support for me for unit state senat and my support for the second amend __PUNCT__ as i said i would do when i went to the unit state senat __PUNCT__
i never subscrib to the notion that it made our countri safer by infring on the second amend right of law __PUNCT__ abid citizen __PUNCT__
i think back to the a rate i got from thi organ and the endors that i wa proud to receiv __PUNCT__
so it not just a matter of promis made __PUNCT__ as far as i concern __PUNCT__
it a matter of commit that have been kept __PUNCT__
but you know __PUNCT__ sometim when the stage get a littl larger __PUNCT__ the voic get a littl weaker __PUNCT__
my first trip to new hampshir after i announc my candidaci __PUNCT__ i went to a gun store __PUNCT__
when i wa in florida just last week __PUNCT__ i went to a gun show right befor the ut __PUNCT__ florida footbal game __PUNCT__
i should have stai at the gun show __PUNCT__
but it not becaus i hang out there everi dai __PUNCT__
it becaus i want to demonstr someth that i think is import __PUNCT__ that i will sai the same thing that i been sai sinc __NUM__ and that what i sai in new hampshir __PUNCT__ i will sai in florida and all part in between __PUNCT__
my philosophi doe not depend on my geographi __PUNCT__ and i thought it wa time i laid down that marker earli on __PUNCT__
but we here todai not just becaus of our support of the second amend __PUNCT__
we here todai for our support for the rest of the constitut and what i call the first principl that thi countri wa found upon __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ these first principl have to do with human natur __PUNCT__
thei have to do with the wisdom of the ag and thei have to do with the notion that there some thing that don't chang in thi chang world that we live in __PUNCT__
it given us the declar of independ __PUNCT__ which remind us __PUNCT__ if we need remind __PUNCT__ that our basic right come from god and not from govern __PUNCT__
it given us the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
it given us the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__ which divid power __PUNCT__ base on the notion that it not good to put too much power in too few hand __PUNCT__
and it divid it not onli at the feder level but between the feder and the state level __PUNCT__ base on the notion that all solut to all problem ar not found in washington __PUNCT__ dc __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ in turn __PUNCT__ is base upon the idea of the etern truth that thi countri wa found upon __PUNCT__ and that the idea of freedom __PUNCT__ individu freedom __PUNCT__ polit freedom __PUNCT__ econom freedom __PUNCT__ and the fact that all those thing ar ti togeth __PUNCT__
and it also base upon the knowledg that we have that if a govern big and power enough to give you anyth __PUNCT__ it is big and power enough to take anyth awai from you __PUNCT__
and we reject that kind of govern in thi countri __PUNCT__
and there were those first principl that allow a fellow like me to get in hi truck and go from on end of the state to the other __PUNCT__
start __NUM__ point down __PUNCT__ wound up __NUM__ point ahead on elect night __PUNCT__
won a state by __NUM__ point two differ elect __PUNCT__ __NUM__ point each __PUNCT__ in a state that bill clinton carri twice __PUNCT__
talk about lower tax __PUNCT__ talk about less regul __PUNCT__ talk about the import of the sanctiti of life __PUNCT__ talk about competit among free peopl in that free marketplac __PUNCT__ talk about the import of trade __PUNCT__ and how if we adher to those principl __PUNCT__ we remain the most prosper countri in the histori of the world __PUNCT__ and not onli for us __PUNCT__ but to set an exampl for everybodi els in the world __PUNCT__ or ani other countri that appli those principl and a littl dose of rule of law __PUNCT__ and it almost guarante econom success for ani nation that ever tri it __PUNCT__ anywher in the world __PUNCT__
and obvious __PUNCT__ a part of that is strong defens and appreci consist for the second amend __PUNCT__
it wa not becaus back in those dai i wa think about run for presid __PUNCT__
i think my histori show that i not stand here befor you as somebodi who ha crave that offic ever sinc i wa a junior in high school __PUNCT__
that not been the case __PUNCT__
i simpli anoth american in anoth american stori __PUNCT__ like mani of you out here __PUNCT__ who look down the road a littl bit __PUNCT__ is concern about hi countri in the futur __PUNCT__ realiz there go to be some decis on the next presid plate go to determin our futur and the futur of our children and grandchildren for mani year to come __PUNCT__
that hit home more to me than ever in the last few year __PUNCT__

what do you think __PUNCT__ but we have been success as a nation __PUNCT__ and we ought to be proud of that fact __PUNCT__
we shouldn't be asham of it __PUNCT__
we taken a lot of critic around the world __PUNCT__ but i alwai think of the proposit that i live in a countri that shed more blood for other peopl liberti than all the other countri in the world __PUNCT__ and there no reason to apolog to the unit state of america __PUNCT__
we ar steep in the tradit of honor and sacrific for the greater good in thi nation __PUNCT__
we ar proud of that heritag __PUNCT__
and our countri and these challeng that ar go to be face us in the near futur need a leader who stand by the principl that ha made us a great nation __PUNCT__ that understand thi nation __PUNCT__ understand her peopl __PUNCT__ understand the great of america past __PUNCT__ but more importantli understand the great of america futur __PUNCT__

go ahead __PUNCT__
moder __PUNCT__ we submit some question from the member __PUNCT__
some have argu that the second amend mean differ thing in differ place __PUNCT__ that it okai for new york citi or chicago to impos more restrict on gun owner __PUNCT__ right than it is in tennesse or montana __PUNCT__
do you agre with that view __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
thompson __PUNCT__ nope __PUNCT__
i would onli point out that it more than coincident that so mani place that have such high crime rate have the toughest gun restrict in america __PUNCT__
that more than a coincid __PUNCT__
moder __PUNCT__ what is your posit on gun show __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
thompson __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ just have come from on __PUNCT__
no __PUNCT__ i __PUNCT__ i enjoi gun show __PUNCT__
i think that thei a part of americana __PUNCT__
i don't know that anybodi would be against gun show __PUNCT__
there ar variou kind of regul and propos that would restrict privat citizen who ar not profession dealer or anyth like that and place rule on them as thei go there __PUNCT__
i alwai been against that __PUNCT__
we have had __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ over my year in the senat all kind and ani kind __PUNCT__ as you well know __PUNCT__ over the eight year i wa there restrict on second amend right of on kind or anoth __PUNCT__ and the __PUNCT__ those who would do that try to pick the most vulner area __PUNCT__ try to pick the high __PUNCT__ profil area __PUNCT__ try to singl out some littl someth and embarrass somebodi with it __PUNCT__
and gun show have been the easi target for that __PUNCT__ but i alwai resist that and would continu to do so __PUNCT__
moder __PUNCT__ if elect presid __PUNCT__ will you support posit of the bush administr that the second amend protect an individu right to keep and bear arm and appoint an attornei gener who doe as well __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__
thompson __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ i think __PUNCT__ i think we win on the interpret of the second amend __PUNCT__
i alwai taken the posit that __PUNCT__ kind of a complic posit that i work out __PUNCT__
the constitut mean what it sai __PUNCT__ and the __PUNCT__ seem to me that the old militia debat that been go on some time is not onli be reject in the court but it be reject by scholar __PUNCT__ who ar not necessarili tradit friend of second amend right __PUNCT__
but the constitut doe mean what it sai __PUNCT__ and it not restrict to protect of militia __PUNCT__
thank you veri much __PUNCT__
