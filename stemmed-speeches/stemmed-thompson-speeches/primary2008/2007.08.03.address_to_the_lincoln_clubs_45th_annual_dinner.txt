he went out there and gave a stir speech to those peopl __PUNCT__ and includ almost the veri word that i had given to him __PUNCT__

and later on he had me for a lot more import reason than that __PUNCT__
we gone through a lot togeth __PUNCT__
you mention the waterg dai __PUNCT__ and my find myself ask a man name alexand butterfield __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ butterfield __PUNCT__ is there a tape system in the white hous __PUNCT__ we live through the aftermath of that __PUNCT__
we live through the sweep of __NUM__ which i got to be a part of __PUNCT__
we came in befor long and were abl to balanc the budget __PUNCT__ pass welfar reform __PUNCT__ and do some other good thing __PUNCT__
i never forget my first senat speech when i got there __PUNCT__
it wa about have congress abid by the law that everyon els must abid by __PUNCT__
it wa a novel concept at the time but we were abl to eventu pass that legisl __PUNCT__
but i made my maiden speech __PUNCT__ of cours the chamber wa just about empti as alwai __PUNCT__ but there wa on old timer there who __PUNCT__ i won't call hi name __PUNCT__ but he been there for mani year __PUNCT__ and he listen to the speech and i wa quit taken with that __PUNCT__
and he came up to me afterward and said __PUNCT__ fred __PUNCT__ good speech __PUNCT__
and i said __PUNCT__ thank you __PUNCT__ and he said __PUNCT__ can i ask you a question __PUNCT__
wa that a real submarin thei us in hunt for red __DATE__ __PUNCT__ i learn right off what peopl prioriti were as far as i wa concern __PUNCT__
of cours my forai into the movi busi brought me out to california from time to time __PUNCT__
i try to tell peopl that i actual shot more movi in north carolina than in california __PUNCT__ but nobodi will believ that so i gave up on that __PUNCT__
i wa a fan of arnold schwarzenegg from the veri begin __PUNCT__
i gave a speech in tennesse where i said some good thing about him when he wa first run __PUNCT__
and the next dai i got a call from arnold in my home thank me for the comment i made __PUNCT__ and i said to myself __PUNCT__ thi fella is go to do alright in polit __PUNCT__
and sure enough he did __PUNCT__
my onli beef wa all those movi he made garner hundr of million of dollar __PUNCT__ it look like he could had some work for me somewher in there __PUNCT__
but arnold alwai plai the hero so it probabl just as well __PUNCT__ i can't imagin what role i would wound up with in on of hi movi __PUNCT__
on of my biggest regret from that busi is that i never met john wayn __PUNCT__
but i understand mani of you did __PUNCT__ right in the next room there __PUNCT__
so we had our up and our down togeth __PUNCT__ and i bet you agre with me that as we look back on those up time __PUNCT__ we probabl were never as up as we thought we were __PUNCT__
and certainli as we look at those down time we never were quit as down as we thought we were __PUNCT__
and that probabl a good thing for us to rememb tonight __PUNCT__
becaus american ar express a lot of concern these dai about the direct their countri is go __PUNCT__ there is some concern that mayb we slip awai like all the great power have __PUNCT__
we hear a bit of that old malais talk we us to hear all about __PUNCT__
part of it is iraq __PUNCT__ certainli __PUNCT__
part of it is the economi __PUNCT__ believ it or not __PUNCT__
the wonder economi and econom new you continu to hear __PUNCT__ the greatest stori never told as some peopl call it __PUNCT__ yet peopl ar talk about the threat of global and the dispar of incom __PUNCT__
and my friend i realli believ that some peopl propos as to how we should react to these thing ar much more danger than the problem that ar perceiv in and of themselv __PUNCT__
some peopl ar sai that in effect after thi war in iraq is over we need to come back home and close the door and lock them and pull down the shade and build up wall of protect and trade protect and rais tax and redistribut the incom __PUNCT__
that their solut __PUNCT__
thei wrong then __PUNCT__ thei been wrong throughout histori __PUNCT__ and that will not happen __PUNCT__
and we have to defend the sound polici that have work for us so often and so effect throughout histori __PUNCT__
you wouldn't think you have to make the lower tax case again __PUNCT__ but you have to make it everi dai in washington dc __PUNCT__
it look like we would come to the conclus a long time ago that thing that promot save __PUNCT__ invest and risk ar good thing __PUNCT__
and when you read the histori book and you see the boom that happen after kennedi lower tax in the __NUM__ __PUNCT__ and you see in __NUM__ when ronald reagan lower tax and turn malais into prosper __PUNCT__ and you see the same thing when georg bush in __NUM__ did the same thing again took a declin economi which he inherit and turn it around into a good thing __PUNCT__ into a posit economi despit 9/11 __PUNCT__ despit what wa go on on wall street __PUNCT__ and the burst of the nasdaq bubbl and all the scandal that were there __PUNCT__
overcam all of that and gave us a situat todai where the govern is collect more revenu than at ani time in histori __PUNCT__
we live in a countri where __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the peopl pai over half the tax and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ of the peopl pai no tax at all and yet that seem to be the focu and the solut for the liber in washington __PUNCT__ just adjust that a littl bit and everyth will be alright __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ we talk about onc again __PUNCT__ target the rich __PUNCT__
my advic for anybodi in the middl class __PUNCT__ don't stand anywher near the target __PUNCT__
wouldn't it be nice instead of argu again about how to divid the pie up again in thi countri that we could talk about how to make the pie a littl bit larger __PUNCT__ wouldn't that be a wonder thing to do __PUNCT__ on global we aren't afraid of america __PUNCT__ it a good thing for america __PUNCT__
we do more thing better than anybodi els __PUNCT__
we have more innov __PUNCT__ we invest more in innov in thi countri and in our servic economi than anybodi in the world __PUNCT__
free trade and free prosper have done more thing and caus more prosper in the world than anyth ani central planner ever could have come up with and america is the best exampl of that __PUNCT__
if we want to help our friend in south america and africa for exampl and other place __PUNCT__ we need to lower our trade barrier __PUNCT__ we need to have more trade __PUNCT__
democraci is a good thing __PUNCT__ sometim though we need to focu on the basic on which democraci can oper __PUNCT__
democraci sometim mean on vote __PUNCT__ on time and it over with __PUNCT__
we need to promot thing like the rule of law __PUNCT__ open market __PUNCT__ and free trade __PUNCT__
ani countri that ha ever tri that ha prosper __PUNCT__ ani countri that hasn't __PUNCT__ ha not __PUNCT__
so we do some thing right in thi countri __PUNCT__ we need to think about that and be proud of that fact and proud of our countri __PUNCT__
we also need to be big enough to acknowledg that some thing ar go wrong in thi countri __PUNCT__
back in __NUM__ i wa chairman of the government affair committe and i wa watch someth that develop in thi countri for a long time __PUNCT__
we were get to a place where some veri import function in thi govern were becom almost inoper __PUNCT__
get fraught with mismanag and lack of account __PUNCT__
i wrote about a __NUM__ page report call govern at the brink __PUNCT__ document the wast __PUNCT__ fraud __PUNCT__ abus __PUNCT__ mismanag __PUNCT__ and lack of account that wa affect govern at that time __PUNCT__
i hand that off to mitch daniel who wa head of omb at that time and later becam governor of indiana and we start discuss what we were go to do about that __PUNCT__
shortli after that 9/11 happen __PUNCT__ refocus everyon attent for a period of time __PUNCT__ with a pretti good result i might add __PUNCT__
the fact that we haven't been attack again in thi countri is no accid __PUNCT__
but we have to get back to refocu on the realiti that is now present problem for us in term of nation secur __PUNCT__
and a lot of it ha onc again to do with the growth of govern __PUNCT__
everi bureaucraci that stai long enough grow __PUNCT__
and everi new bureaucraci that creat __PUNCT__ on is creat beneath it __PUNCT__
good peopl __PUNCT__ come into washington to head an agenc __PUNCT__ head a depart for awhil __PUNCT__ thei usual from around the countri __PUNCT__
bring them in for a confirm process that cost them a fortun in account fee __PUNCT__ in lawyer fee __PUNCT__ and __NUM__ month befor some committe argu about them __PUNCT__
and final when thei get there to serv __PUNCT__ thei want to do someth import for their countri __PUNCT__ thei want to oper and engag in broad polici issu that thei came to washington to address __PUNCT__ not to fight their own bureaucraci __PUNCT__ not to spend all their time in civil servic proceed on somebodi that thei thought need to be fire __PUNCT__
and so it goe on and on __PUNCT__ and after awhil we end up with depart that can't pass an audit __PUNCT__ comput system that can't talk to each other after spend hundr of million of dollar __PUNCT__ intellig system that ar fail __PUNCT__ and peopl in over their head __PUNCT__
and yet throughout all of thi __PUNCT__ we have a lot of peopl still in washington todai __PUNCT__ sad to sai not all of on parti __PUNCT__ that when thei get a good idea thei want to feder thing that have been under the state purview for year and year __PUNCT__
depriv the nation of the experiment and divers that out there in the state __PUNCT__
that how we got welfar reform __PUNCT__ becaus of state activ that work so it wa pick up and us __PUNCT__
i think out attitud ought to be in the feder govern to do what you suppos to do and do it compet __PUNCT__ and then mayb we give you someth els to do __PUNCT__
on of those thing is border secur __PUNCT__
the immigr problem ha to do with immigr __PUNCT__ but it in larg part ha to do with nation secur __PUNCT__
we live in a world now __PUNCT__ we have inherit a world that is watch the attempt marriag between radic islam fundament and nuclear technolog __PUNCT__
we live in a world where __NUM__ countri have fissil materi suffici to make a nuclear weapon __PUNCT__ and the bad gui ar try their best to get their hand on it __PUNCT__
and we live in a countri with porou border and porou port __PUNCT__ and it doesn't take a geniu to put all that togeth and see the problem that we got in thi countri __PUNCT__
and i think peopl ar go to demand that we address that first __PUNCT__
i don't think the __NUM__ million illeg alien that ar here ar as much a concern as the next __NUM__ million and the next __NUM__ million on infinitum __PUNCT__
we were told befor that there wa a solut to thi if we would onli pass a bill __PUNCT__ but we did that in __NUM__ and now we come back with the same old stuff __PUNCT__ so i don't think that peopl ar go to respond to it until that border situat is address __PUNCT__
then i think peopl of goodwil ought to sit down and work out the rest of it togeth __PUNCT__
we have a good problem in thi countri __PUNCT__ and that is we have the best medic system in the world __PUNCT__
it too expens __PUNCT__ we need to do someth about it __PUNCT__
there need to be a lot of convers about it __PUNCT__
but in the meantim __PUNCT__ we need to ensur we don't destroi the best of someth that man ha ever creat that is keep so mani peopl aliv so much longer __PUNCT__
we grow older as a societi __PUNCT__ thank good __PUNCT__ thank god __PUNCT__
but we not produc enough young peopl in the workforc to pai for the retir plan that we have in thi countri __PUNCT__ to pai for our social secur and medicar oblig __PUNCT__
it simpli a matter of demograph __PUNCT__
and if we continu on the present pace befor too long __PUNCT__ it will sap all the revenu of the govern __PUNCT__ and our govern will be noth more than a transfer agent __PUNCT__ transfer wealth from on gener to the next __PUNCT__
and the tax necessari to fill that gap ar go to be so backbreak and astronom that young peopl try to start out __PUNCT__ bui that first home and pai their mortgag __PUNCT__ that it will absolut ruin our economi __PUNCT__
now __PUNCT__ most of the folk in washington __PUNCT__ all of the folk know about it __PUNCT__ it not a matter of lack of expertis __PUNCT__ lack of knowledg __PUNCT__ it a matter of lack of will __PUNCT__
and for the profession politician there is noth more danger than uncertainti and possibl do someth that somebodi doesn't like __PUNCT__
and it never occur to ani of them to explain to peopl the necess to do someth for the countri might work __PUNCT__
thei oper on the basi that thi gener is too greedi to do anyth for the next gener __PUNCT__ and the next gener after that __PUNCT__
i think that the exact opposit of the truth __PUNCT__
i think if a credibl case is made to the american peopl that mom and dad and grandmom and granddad will be more than happi to make the adjust necessari to protect their kid and their grandkid in the next gener __PUNCT__ if thei just given a chanc __PUNCT__
why in the world would you want be in polit if you can't make a differ __PUNCT__ everyon sai thei want to do that __PUNCT__
here you can make a differ not onli with thi gener but the next on after that and the next on after that __PUNCT__
what kind of legaci peopl could leav __PUNCT__
thei within our control __PUNCT__
the problem we have should not depress us __PUNCT__ thei ar in our control __PUNCT__
obvious when you got close number you go to need a certain amount of bipartisanship to get thing done __PUNCT__
you need that anywai __PUNCT__
it is sore lack __PUNCT__
we do have some good peopl who ar will to do that __PUNCT__ not enough __PUNCT__ but will to do that __PUNCT__
but we need to understand the basi for bipartisanship __PUNCT__
it doesn't come with addit photo __PUNCT__ op or addit nice statement that alwai happen with a new congress and a new presid befor thei can get in mutual corner and pull out the knive __PUNCT__ it happen with the american peopl __PUNCT__
that the onli thing that will deriv the polit leader in congress to do the right thing __PUNCT__ becaus thei be afraid not to becaus the peopl will be on the other side __PUNCT__
i am hope that after thi next elect __PUNCT__ the good peopl __PUNCT__ the peopl who ar reform __PUNCT__ mind and chang __PUNCT__ mind in the good wai __PUNCT__ and the next presid of the unit state can go to the american peopl and just sai thi __PUNCT__ in effect __PUNCT__ we got a new situat on our hand now __PUNCT__ and we live in a new era __PUNCT__
we go to be test in mani wai __PUNCT__ mai even be under attack __PUNCT__ mayb for a long time __PUNCT__
but it time to be honest with ourselv __PUNCT__ we need to do some thing better __PUNCT__ and we need to do some thing differ __PUNCT__
here what we need to do __PUNCT__ and here why we need to do it __PUNCT__
now that you been call upon __PUNCT__ and you understand i know that you respond for the sake of your nation and the next gener __PUNCT__ becaus you alwai have __PUNCT__
and when we get the respons that i think we get from the american peopl from that it shake the capit and you have your bipartisanship __PUNCT__
i don't think there an question that if we leav iraq befor there is some semblanc of stabil in that nation __PUNCT__ so those brave peopl there have a chanc to make their govern and democraci work __PUNCT__ that the world is go to be a more danger place __PUNCT__
and as long as we have ani chanc there __PUNCT__ as long as those brave peopl on the front line who ar make our sacrific for us __PUNCT__ and do so much as long as thei have a chanc and thei sai thei have a chanc __PUNCT__ we need to give them the opportun to make that work there __PUNCT__
my own feel is that under the worst circumst there that we go to leav a new haven for terrorist and we go to leav an area of the world that becom more and more nuclear __PUNCT__
that those civilian nation surround iraq will respond to what iran is do to their nuclear program and that the whole place will be nuclear and that will be bad for us in mani respect __PUNCT__
there is someth els that we need to start think about with all of thi attent and all of the headlin __PUNCT__ that there is go to be a dai after __PUNCT__
even if we leav in the best of circumst __PUNCT__ even if we abl to assist in restor stabil there and give that govern a chanc to work __PUNCT__ we go to be out of there eventu __PUNCT__
and when we do __PUNCT__ we go to find ourselv in a world that is still veri danger __PUNCT__
we go to find iran do what it do __PUNCT__ north korea do what it do in prove itself to be a danger to the world __PUNCT__
al qaeda is not go to go anyplac good __PUNCT__ it still go to be there try to get the unit state __PUNCT__
georg tenet just came out with a book __PUNCT__ and a lot of peopl ar of cours concentr on the who shot john and who did what to whom __PUNCT__ and thei probabl right __PUNCT__ i haven't read it __PUNCT__ it probabl just anoth attempt to answer critic and place blame on somebodi els __PUNCT__ but i did see thi __PUNCT__
it someth we need to pai attent to __PUNCT__ he been there __PUNCT__
it sai there no question on my mind that al qaeda is alreadi here __PUNCT__ thei intent __PUNCT__ patient __PUNCT__ and intend to put a mushroom cloud over an american citi no matter how long it take __PUNCT__
that the kind of world we go to wake up to after iraq is wai in our rear view mirror __PUNCT__
we go to find a china and a russia both with militari build up __PUNCT__
we go to see a china with hundr of missil point toward taiwan __PUNCT__ a countri we pledg to defend __PUNCT__
we see both of those countri plai danger __PUNCT__ aggress intern energi polit all over the world __PUNCT__
in turn we see our alli and nato spend less and less on their own militari to even defend themselv __PUNCT__
unabl appar to keep their commit to afghanistan despit it be what thei call __PUNCT__ the good war __PUNCT__
so i ask you __PUNCT__ even though we won't be go around in the wood try to find ani bear to kill __PUNCT__ sometim the bear visit you whether you look for it or not __PUNCT__
and when that time come __PUNCT__ and hopefulli the peopl on the forc of civil __PUNCT__ realiz thei fight the forc of destruct and dark __PUNCT__ who is go to need to stand firm and stand strong and stand unit __PUNCT__ if it not the unit state of america __PUNCT__ we been there befor though my friend __PUNCT__ thi is not our first rodeo __PUNCT__
we went through a great depress in thi countri befor and came out the most prosper countri in the world __PUNCT__
we went through a bloodi civil war and __NUM__ world war and came out the most power nation in the world and for the world __PUNCT__
and we join hand on a bipartisan basi and went through a sever year period of time in our histori togeth dure the cold war and saw the end of the soviet union __PUNCT__
so what do we do now __PUNCT__ not wring our hand __PUNCT__
we do what we alwai done befor __PUNCT__
there a model for what we do __PUNCT__ we creat it __PUNCT__
we had strong bipartisan leadership dure that time __PUNCT__
do you ever wonder why when our problem seem to be get larger __PUNCT__ our politician seem to be get smaller __PUNCT__ i pull out an old clip __PUNCT__ i a clipper __PUNCT__ i see thing i like i alwai tear it out of the newspap __PUNCT__ can't figur out why it more difficult horizont than it is vertic __PUNCT__ but thi i came across the other dai from about a year ago __PUNCT__
thoma sowel __PUNCT__ who mani of you have come to read on a regular basi __PUNCT__ in a coupl of instanc he said when wendel wilk got defeat against franklin roosevelt __PUNCT__ he didn't go around critic him __PUNCT__ he went to work for him __PUNCT__
becam an ambassador to winston churchil for him __PUNCT__
nevil chamberlain __PUNCT__ a lot of historian said he wa an appeas and brought on world war __NUM__ faster than otherwis would happen __PUNCT__ while all the time ignor the pain plead of winston churchil __PUNCT__ but when chamberlain di __PUNCT__ churchil spoke hi eulogi __PUNCT__
said he wa a good man __PUNCT__
and he said __PUNCT__ no matter how the fate mai plai __PUNCT__ those who do their best for their countri alwai march in the rank of honor __PUNCT__ and nevil chamberlain march in the rank of honor __PUNCT__
compar that magnanim with what we see todai __PUNCT__
you would hope that in thi time of difficulti in our countri and uncertainti in mani wai __PUNCT__ that we could have an adult discuss about our futur and that we could spend a littl more time think about the thing that unit us and bring us togeth __PUNCT__ such as our common heritag __PUNCT__
i leav you with thi on more littl stori __PUNCT__
on mondai of thi week __PUNCT__ becaus i gotten a call from a friend of mine __PUNCT__ i drove into washington and met with a __NUM__ th grade class from the oakwood school __PUNCT__ north hollywood __PUNCT__
the father of on of those littl girl there __PUNCT__ hi name is roger love __PUNCT__ is a friend of mine and ask me to come down and talk to the kid __PUNCT__ and so i did __PUNCT__
and we talk about variou thing and i told them some of my stori and some of the thing that thei might take awai in term of door open and be prepar and thing of that natur __PUNCT__
and a littl boi ask me when it wa time to wrap up __PUNCT__ why ar you interest in polit __PUNCT__ why ar you interest in govern __PUNCT__ and of cours i could talk for hour __PUNCT__ as i have prove here tonight __PUNCT__ but i know i had to put it in a veri few word __PUNCT__ and send them on their wai __PUNCT__
so i heard myself sai thi __PUNCT__ that when i wa a young man i wa interest in polit becaus i wa interest in the debat __PUNCT__ and the win and the lose __PUNCT__
but as i becam older i becam interest in what polit wa suppos to do such as protect our liberti __PUNCT__
and even then in read world histori and look at other govern and watch the new __PUNCT__ i began to appreci how veri uniqu thi place wa __PUNCT__ that i had been lucki to be born here __PUNCT__
and how a hand of intellectu and a group of peopl that were far from intellectu __PUNCT__ averag peopl some with run __PUNCT__ in with the law and servant and whatnot __PUNCT__ came over here and carv out a countri __PUNCT__ eventu write a constitut that wa the enemi of the world and still is todai __PUNCT__ elect a presid who could have been king but instead after __NUM__ year of servic got on hi hors and rode out of town and as far as can be told never came back to washington to even visit __PUNCT__
and how __NUM__ or __NUM__ year later __PUNCT__ anoth great presid who we honor here tonight __PUNCT__ spoke at gettysburg __PUNCT__ and he wonder aloud whether or not averag peopl could come togeth and form a govern and endur when the go realli got tough __PUNCT__
and he knew that it could __PUNCT__
and it did __PUNCT__
and befor and sinc that time __PUNCT__ everi gener ha done it part to ensur that it did endur with the sacrific thei made __PUNCT__
and now it our turn __PUNCT__
it took those kid to draw me back in and think about that common heritag __PUNCT__
mayb we ought to talk to the kid more often __PUNCT__
