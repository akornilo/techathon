i alwai look forward to visit the unit kingdom __PUNCT__ and thi time around i couldn't ask for a better host than the polici exchang __PUNCT__
we have a few polici back home that we like to exchang __PUNCT__ and think tank like thi ar the place to come __PUNCT__
after just five year __PUNCT__ the polici exchang rank among the best __PUNCT__ and the fine reput of your work ha reach washington as well __PUNCT__
i congratul all of you __PUNCT__ and i thank you for the hospit __PUNCT__
your kind invit bring me here just as great britain prepar to greet an incom prime minist __PUNCT__
back in the u. __PUNCT__ we abl to watch the hous of common __PUNCT__ prime minist question time __PUNCT__ which mr __PUNCT__ brown will now endur __PUNCT__
i thought that america need a weekli question and answer period between the presid and congress __PUNCT__
but in the past few month i decid it isn't such a good idea __PUNCT__
your system also allow a chang in the head of govern at a moment notic __PUNCT__
even your gener elect campaign ar mercifulli brief __PUNCT__
of cours we believ in long presidenti campaign in the u. __PUNCT__
most american politician ar afraid thei won't be consid seriou candid until thei made a promis a hundr time and spent a hundr million dollar __PUNCT__
though everi now and then you still get some slow __PUNCT__ poke who take hi time befor announc __PUNCT__
i congratul mr __PUNCT__ brown __PUNCT__ and i wish him well as the __NUM__ prime minist of the unit kingdom __PUNCT__
and if you allow me a word about the __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we miss him __PUNCT__
there ar disput of parti here that ar strictli british affair __PUNCT__
but sometim the better point of statesmen possibl ar seen more clearli at a distanc __PUNCT__
we ar profoundli grate for the friendship of the british peopl __PUNCT__ and in america we alwai rememb mr __PUNCT__ blair as a gallant friend __PUNCT__ even when it did him no good polit __PUNCT__
when we in the state take the measur of your leader __PUNCT__ their parti affili doesn't realli count for a whole lot __PUNCT__
it been thi wai for a while now __PUNCT__ at everi moment when it matter __PUNCT__
it wa true in the dai of churchil and roosevelt __PUNCT__ of thatcher and reagan __PUNCT__ and blair and bush __PUNCT__
differ of parti and domest polici ar incident __PUNCT__ compar to the bigger consider that defin britain and america as alli __PUNCT__
on both side of the atlant __PUNCT__ what matter most ar the commit we share __PUNCT__ and the work we ar call to do in common __PUNCT__
thi work is base upon the principl we hold __PUNCT__ primarili __PUNCT__ the right of free peopl to govern themselv __PUNCT__
we also believ that the rule of law __PUNCT__ market economi __PUNCT__ properti right __PUNCT__ and trade with other nation ar the underpin of a free societi __PUNCT__
when historian of the modern era speak of the great democraci __PUNCT__ of civil and it defend __PUNCT__ that us thei talk about __PUNCT__ we and our democrat friend across europ and beyond __PUNCT__
in the long progress of the world toward liberti __PUNCT__ it wa not by chanc that thi lowli provinc of the roman empir becam a great teacher of democraci and the model of self __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__
and it wasn't just luck that turn a troublesom british coloni into the inspir for all those who seek freedom __PUNCT__
there is a reason why britain and america were thrown togeth as partner in thi world __PUNCT__
the thing that unit the american and british peopl __PUNCT__ thei don't chang with the name of leader or with the pass of year __PUNCT__
it wa harold macmillan who best sum up the share experi of british and american leader in the last centuri __PUNCT__
in hi later year __PUNCT__ lord stockton wa ask what he consid the greatest challeng in all hi year as a statesman __PUNCT__
and in that english wai __PUNCT__ he put it in a word __PUNCT__ event __PUNCT__ my dear boi __PUNCT__ event __PUNCT__
event often have a wai of intrud upon the plan of free peopl __PUNCT__
as a rule __PUNCT__ peopl in democrat societi prefer to take care of the busi of life __PUNCT__
thei rais famili __PUNCT__
thei work and thei trade __PUNCT__
thei creat wealth and thei share it __PUNCT__
abov all in free societi __PUNCT__ we live by the law __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ at our best __PUNCT__ we look after on anoth __PUNCT__ too __PUNCT__
yet in everi gener __PUNCT__ event __PUNCT__ can be count on to chang the plan __PUNCT__ sometim in tragic wai __PUNCT__
often the caus of our grief is a misplac trust in the good intent of other __PUNCT__
in our deal with other nation __PUNCT__ peopl in free countri ar not the type to go look for troubl __PUNCT__
we tend to extend our good will to other nation __PUNCT__ assum that it will be return in kind __PUNCT__
no matter how clear the signal __PUNCT__ sometim in histori even the best of men fail to act in time to prevent the worst from happen __PUNCT__
the unit state and the unit kingdom have learn thi lesson both wai __PUNCT__ in great evil ignor __PUNCT__ and in great evil avert __PUNCT__
we learn it from a world war that happen and __PUNCT__ in the decad afterward __PUNCT__ from the world war that didn't happen __PUNCT__
we must conclud that the greatest test of leadership __PUNCT__ in your countri or mine __PUNCT__ in thi time or ani other __PUNCT__ can be simpli state __PUNCT__
we must shape event __PUNCT__ and not be left at their merci __PUNCT__
and in all thing __PUNCT__ to protect ourselv and to assur the peac __PUNCT__ the great democraci of the world must stick togeth __PUNCT__
we must be will to make tough decis todai in order to avert bigger problem tomorrow __PUNCT__
we must be prepar to meet threat befor threat becom tragedi __PUNCT__
these ar not consider relev onli to the peopl of great britain and the unit state __PUNCT__
the relationship between the unit state and all of europ is valu by both side and ha benefit the world __PUNCT__
nato ha not onli been an effect tool for our effort __PUNCT__ it symbol our common __PUNCT__
chang in leadership on both side of the atlant will give us new opportun __PUNCT__
often in the histori of nation __PUNCT__ leader rise to meet the time __PUNCT__
these time requir those with the wisdom and courag to see past the next elect cycl __PUNCT__
the unit state and our european alli must begin to forg a new understand that match the time we live in __PUNCT__
thi must be an understand base upon candor if we ar to come closer to agreement as to the natur of the challeng we face __PUNCT__
i have great hope for such a new understand among nato alli __PUNCT__
we would never want to look back on a campaign we undertaken to realiz we fallen short for lack of commit or materi support __PUNCT__
todai our enemi do not doubt our militari strength __PUNCT__
thei do question our determin __PUNCT__
our effort will requir ongo dialogu base upon mutual respect and mutual interest __PUNCT__
for mani american __PUNCT__ there is a concern that even among our friend __PUNCT__ some peopl ar instinct uncomfort with u. __PUNCT__ power __PUNCT__
some on the contin speak of the need for europ to balanc u. __PUNCT__ influenc __PUNCT__
american worri that thi sentiment could __PUNCT__ over time __PUNCT__ lead to an uncoupl of the allianc __PUNCT__
and if constrain u. __PUNCT__ power is that import __PUNCT__ would our european friend be comfort with other power serv as a counterweight to the unit state __PUNCT__ some who seek to check u. __PUNCT__ power believ that legitimaci mai onli be confer by intern consensu as repres by the un secur council __PUNCT__
thei ask __PUNCT__ if a countri can invad anoth nation for it own good reason __PUNCT__ what is the logic stop point __PUNCT__ the american respons is to ask how __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ doe on justifi non __PUNCT__ secur __PUNCT__ council __PUNCT__ sanction action __PUNCT__ such as kosovo __PUNCT__ what ar nation allow to do when the un cannot muster the polit will to act __PUNCT__ how mani countri must be involv in an action befor legitimaci is confer __PUNCT__ is it just european countri that count __PUNCT__ and __PUNCT__ how do we deal with problem in concert when mani of us don't agre on the extent or natur of the problem __PUNCT__ for our part __PUNCT__ we in the unit state must make a better case for our view and our action __PUNCT__
it is possibl that thing that ar perfectli obviou to us mai not be so obviou even to those who wish us well __PUNCT__
we must be will to listen and we must be will to share our intellig to the maximum extent appropri __PUNCT__
we must be prepar to make our case not just privat __PUNCT__ but to the peopl of europ and the world in order to build polit support for cooper __PUNCT__
the world is not stronger if america is weaker __PUNCT__ or is perceiv to be weaker __PUNCT__
the same is true of britain and truer still of our nato allianc __PUNCT__
and we must be capabl of make that case __PUNCT__
in return __PUNCT__ it is fair to expect that our alli will not put their trade and commerci interest abov world secur __PUNCT__
it is also fair to ask that european consid the consequ if thei ar wrong about the threat to the western world __PUNCT__
mani in europ simpli have a differ view from that of the unit state as to the threat of radic islam fundament __PUNCT__
thei think that the threat is overblown __PUNCT__
that despit __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and __DATE__ and other attack in europ and elsewher __PUNCT__ america is the main target and therefor the problem is basic an american on __PUNCT__
the fact that no weapon of mass destruct were found in iraq at a particular point in time resolv the matter for them __PUNCT__
also __PUNCT__ thei see no meaning connect between terrorist group and countri like iran __PUNCT__
admittedli __PUNCT__ even some in america think that the threat is overblown __PUNCT__ and that if we had not gone into iraq __PUNCT__ we have no terror problem __PUNCT__
howev __PUNCT__ most american feel differ __PUNCT__
we understand that the western world is in an intern struggl with jihadist who see thi struggl as part of a conflict that ha gone on for centuri __PUNCT__ and who won't give up until western countri ar brought to their knee __PUNCT__
i agre with thi view __PUNCT__
i believ that the forc of civil must work togeth with common purpos to defeat the terrorist who for their own twist purpos have murder thousand __PUNCT__ and who ar try to acquir technolog to murder million more __PUNCT__
when terrorist in their video perform pledg more and bigger attack to come __PUNCT__ against target in both europ and america __PUNCT__ these ar not to be shrug off as idl boast __PUNCT__
thei must be taken at their word __PUNCT__
when the presid of iran share hi nightmar vision befor cheer crowd __PUNCT__ those ar not just the fanat version of an empti applaus line __PUNCT__
the onli safe assumpt is that he mean it __PUNCT__
if we know anyth from modern histori __PUNCT__ it is that when fanat tyrant pledg to __PUNCT__ wipe out __PUNCT__ an entir nation __PUNCT__ we should listen __PUNCT__
we must gather our allianc __PUNCT__ and do all in our power to make sure that such men do not gain the capabl to carri out their evil ambit __PUNCT__
of cours __PUNCT__ diplomaci is alwai to be prefer in our deal with danger regim __PUNCT__
but i believ diplomaci __PUNCT__ as franklin roosevelt put it __PUNCT__ is more than __PUNCT__ note write __PUNCT__
the word of our leader command much closer attent from adversari when it is understood that we and our alli ar prepar to us forc when forc is necessari __PUNCT__
the campaign in afghanistan is a prime exampl of thi __PUNCT__ both as a larg success effort against a terrorist state and as a logic extens of the mission of nato __PUNCT__ which now reach far beyond the boundari of europ __PUNCT__
as in iraq __PUNCT__ the effort ha involv great sacrific from the brave son and daughter of britain __PUNCT__
by their valor __PUNCT__ and by the sustain action of nato in afghanistan __PUNCT__ we have shown our serious of purpos against terror __PUNCT__
an abil to move beyond the militari model of cold war dai __PUNCT__ and a capac to shift tactic and technolog to fight an enemi who defend no state and observ no code __PUNCT__
even in the midst of all the divis with regard to our action in iraq __PUNCT__ the unit state __PUNCT__ great britain and our coalit should be proud of what we have avert __PUNCT__
imagin saddam hussein and hi murder son in power todai successfulli defi the intern commun and free to pursu weapon program __PUNCT__
of cours polit realism is back in the ascend sinc the difficulti in iraq __PUNCT__
it true that we have learn that geographi __PUNCT__ histori __PUNCT__ and ethnic ar import factor to consid in make decis regard todai enemi __PUNCT__
we also been remind of the import of prepar __PUNCT__ of allianc __PUNCT__ and the continu support of our peopl __PUNCT__
but that doe not chang the fact that we sometim must address event in far __PUNCT__ awai place that endang our peopl __PUNCT__
or that we believ in univers valu that do not allow us to ignor wholesal human suffer __PUNCT__
realism __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__
but also ideal __PUNCT__ which is what make us differ from our enemi __PUNCT__
we should also rememb that beyond the war on terror __PUNCT__ there ar other threat we must meet togeth that extend well into the futur __PUNCT__
on wai or anoth __PUNCT__ the challeng we face todai will reced __PUNCT__
other challeng to our share interest and secur have not been wait patient in line for our attent __PUNCT__
some cannot yet be seen __PUNCT__ but it is obviou that our energi need for exampl ar not go awai __PUNCT__
disrupt in energi suppli __PUNCT__ sharp price increas and thuggish behavior by energi supplier ar threat to all democraci with grow economi __PUNCT__
also __PUNCT__ rapid militari build __PUNCT__ up by non __PUNCT__ democrat nation should be of concern __PUNCT__
more and more __PUNCT__ if thing go wrong in disput that were onc consid just region problem __PUNCT__ there will be no __PUNCT__ over there __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ over here __PUNCT__
we all be affect __PUNCT__
global is not limit to econom matter __PUNCT__
as we go through these peril time __PUNCT__ we must keep firmli in mind the thing that bind us togeth __PUNCT__ not disagr __PUNCT__
we been through a lot togeth __PUNCT__ our two nation __PUNCT__ and not just in the stori exploit of our parent __PUNCT__ gener __PUNCT__
though there ar mani moment in british polit histori from which leader todai can take instruct __PUNCT__ there is on in particular that i alwai admir in the career of sir winston churchil __PUNCT__
it wa when nevil chamberlain di in __DATE__ __PUNCT__
in memori in the hous of common hi longtim adversari __PUNCT__ churchil pronounc the bitter controversi put to rest __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ quot __PUNCT__ histori with it flicker lamp stumbl along the trail of the past __PUNCT__ try to reconstruct it scene __PUNCT__ to reviv it echo __PUNCT__ and kindl with pale gleam the passion of former dai __PUNCT__
in the end __PUNCT__ he reflect __PUNCT__ the onli guid to a man is hi conscienc __PUNCT__ the onli shield to hi memori is the rectitud and sincer of hi action __PUNCT__
we ar __PUNCT__ so often mock by the failur of our hope and the upset of our calcul __PUNCT__ but with thi shield __PUNCT__ howev the fate mai plai __PUNCT__ we march alwai in the rank of honour __PUNCT__
mayb it the actor in me that admir thi scene so much __PUNCT__
it a moment that no script __PUNCT__ writer could improv upon __PUNCT__
i am struck by it spirit __PUNCT__ the magnanim and generos of the man __PUNCT__ the willing to let old argument go __PUNCT__ and move on to great object held in common __PUNCT__
we in thi allianc have had our own share of hope mock and plan upset __PUNCT__
and now it is time to shake off the disappoint __PUNCT__ to let go of controversi past __PUNCT__ and to press on togeth toward the great object __PUNCT__
to ensur secur for our peopl __PUNCT__
to be a forc for stabil in the world __PUNCT__
to remain the stalwart friend of freedom __PUNCT__
for our part __PUNCT__ we in the unit state have never had occas to doubt the fortitud and faith of the british peopl __PUNCT__
as much as ever __PUNCT__ we count ourselv lucki to call the unit kingdom our closest alli __PUNCT__ and we ar proud to call you our finest friend __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__
