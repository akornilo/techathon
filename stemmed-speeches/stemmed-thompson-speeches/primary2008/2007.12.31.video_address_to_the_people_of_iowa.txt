by ani measur __PUNCT__ we live in the greatest countri in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
everi gener of american ha an oblig to keep it that wai __PUNCT__
and to do that we must rememb how we got to where we ar __PUNCT__ and why we ar so bless __PUNCT__
that mean rememb the fundament __PUNCT__ conserv principl that have unifi us for over two centuri __PUNCT__
what ar those principl __PUNCT__ first __PUNCT__ the role of the feder govern is limit to the power given to it in the constitut __PUNCT__ second __PUNCT__ a dollar belong in the pocket of the person who earn it __PUNCT__ unless the govern ha a compel reason why it can us it better __PUNCT__ third __PUNCT__ we don't spend monei we don't have __PUNCT__ or borrow monei that our children and grandchildren will have to pai back __PUNCT__ and the best wai to avoid war is to be stronger than our enemi __PUNCT__
but if we caught in a fight __PUNCT__ we need to win it becaus not do so make us much more like to be attack in the futur __PUNCT__ also the feder judiciari is suppos to decid case __PUNCT__ not set social polici __PUNCT__ and bad social polici at that __PUNCT__ and the bigger the govern get __PUNCT__ the less compet it is to run our live __PUNCT__
now these ar ideal and principl that made our countri free __PUNCT__ prosper and strong __PUNCT__
and these principl ar the foundat of a conserv movement that i been faith to throughout my adult life __PUNCT__
these ar not principl i decid on a few year ago __PUNCT__
thei ar not concept that i learn from a focu group __PUNCT__
and thei ar not idea i came up with to curri favor or to win an elect __PUNCT__
these principl ar part of who i am and __PUNCT__ i suspect __PUNCT__ thei ar view and instinct i share with most of you __PUNCT__
and everi singl on of these principl is under assault todai __PUNCT__ under assault from a left wing __PUNCT__ big __PUNCT__ govern __PUNCT__ high __PUNCT__ tax __PUNCT__ weak __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ defens democrat parti __PUNCT__
a parti whose leadership is lick it chop just wait to take over the rein of govern __PUNCT__ wait to bring to the unit state presid the same reckless power __PUNCT__ seek and incompet it brought thi year to the unit state congress __PUNCT__
that why the upcom caucus ar so import __PUNCT__
on __DATE__ __PUNCT__ the peopl of iowa ar go to answer an import question __PUNCT__
who the man you want to repres us __PUNCT__ to stand against thi assault and protect our principl and valu __PUNCT__ it a littl late in the process to be coi __PUNCT__
i believ i that man __PUNCT__
i can stand up to those who would trifl with our great found principl __PUNCT__
i done it befor __PUNCT__
i blow the whistl on their scheme __PUNCT__
and i know how to beat them in the war of idea __PUNCT__
and in demonstr that __PUNCT__ i have laid out plan for __PUNCT__ a simplifi __PUNCT__ flatter incom tax to take awai power from the ir a wai to save a social secur system that is go bankrupt a stronger militari readi to face the threat of a danger world __PUNCT__ and a solut to our illeg immigr mess __PUNCT__
ani number of public and comment __PUNCT__ the wall street journal __PUNCT__ the washington post __PUNCT__ nation review __PUNCT__ investor busi daili and other __PUNCT__ have prais these plan __PUNCT__
and mani have point out that i the onli republican in the race for the presid who ha step up to offer such bold __PUNCT__ conserv idea __PUNCT__
i invit you to check the polici detail on my websit __URL__
but you not elect a set of posit paper __PUNCT__
you elect a leader __PUNCT__ at a time when strong leadership is go to be need __PUNCT__
now if you watch or heard about the most recent debat between the republican candid you probabl know that i declin when call upon by the moder to do ani hand __PUNCT__ rais __PUNCT__ i just thought that there should be some thing that ar below even the digniti of presidenti candid __PUNCT__
but the point thi __PUNCT__ i don't think it wa difficult to pick the leader out of that line __PUNCT__ up __PUNCT__
if those other fella can't stand up to an overbear moder in a debat __PUNCT__ i not sure how thei would fare against the leader of iran or north korea __PUNCT__
now there ar mani good men run for our parti nomin __PUNCT__
each of them love our countri __PUNCT__
each of them ha someth interest and us to offer __PUNCT__
but the fact of the matter is that the republican parti is a conserv parti __PUNCT__
that __PUNCT__ s the philosophi that shape us __PUNCT__
that the philosophi that ha won us elect __PUNCT__
and that the philosophi we must champion if we ar to win again in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and on that score __PUNCT__ among each of the men seek our parti nomin __PUNCT__ my record stand out __PUNCT__
i enter public life as a conserv __PUNCT__
i serv in the senat as a strong __PUNCT__ consist conserv with a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ pro life vote record __PUNCT__
and i have the same philosophi todai that i had back then __PUNCT__
what you see is what you get __PUNCT__
i danc to no man tune __PUNCT__
and no on ha ever accus me of chang my posit on anyth for the sake of polit expedi __PUNCT__
that why when someon here in iowa said conserv were look for a hors to ride in __NUM__ i respond __PUNCT__ saddl me up __PUNCT__
and in the battl of idea __PUNCT__ we can't afford a republican leader who doesn't have a core philosophi that ground him __PUNCT__
i know who i am __PUNCT__
i know what i believ __PUNCT__
and i am readi to lead __PUNCT__
when i wa in the feder govern __PUNCT__ i concentr on nation secur __PUNCT__
i serv on the intellig committe __PUNCT__ met with foreign leader around the world __PUNCT__
and i manag for the republican side the passag of the homeland secur bill which i believ ha help us prevent anoth __PUNCT__ 9/11 __PUNCT__
i continu public servic after i left govern __PUNCT__
although my role on tv __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ order __PUNCT__ got consider more public __PUNCT__ i took on other role from time to time as well __PUNCT__
when condoleeza rice need someon to advis her on matter of intern secur __PUNCT__ she call on me __PUNCT__
when the presid need help to get a good conserv judg confirm as chief justic of the unit state suprem court __PUNCT__ he call on me __PUNCT__
what it all come down to is thi __PUNCT__ the most import issu face us is the nation secur of our nation and the safeti of our peopl __PUNCT__
i spent a lot of time both in and out of govern work to make the american peopl safer __PUNCT__
i know the world we live in __PUNCT__ i know what we need to do __PUNCT__ and i know it go to requir strong leadership __PUNCT__
and i would ask peopl to think on thing befor thei caucu __PUNCT__ when our worst enemi is sit across from us at the negoti tabl __PUNCT__ and thei think about what thei can do to harm the unit state of america __PUNCT__ and what thei might could get awai with __PUNCT__ who do you want sit on our side of the tabl repres you __PUNCT__ work to keep you safe __PUNCT__ that probabl the person you ought to elect as presid __PUNCT__
i been test __PUNCT__
and i believ our countri best dai ar ahead of us if we take on the respons of leadership __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar wait for us to step up __PUNCT__ protect our valu __PUNCT__ our principl and our countri __PUNCT__
togeth we can do someth great for america __PUNCT__
i welcom that challeng __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ i need your help __PUNCT__
becaus right now in thi final weekend anoth issu is befor us __PUNCT__ that of elect __PUNCT__
i believ i am the onli candid in thi race who can bring our parti to victori in the fall __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ becaus of the firm of my principl and the trust that that engend __PUNCT__
secondli __PUNCT__ becaus of the detail program i put befor the peopl __PUNCT__
third __PUNCT__ becaus i been tri and test __PUNCT__ and i a known quantiti in public life __PUNCT__
but __PUNCT__ most of all __PUNCT__ i think i know how to talk to the american peopl about the opposit and the danger their victori would pose to the principl we hold dear __PUNCT__
you know in the last debat __PUNCT__ when i wa ask the biggest problem with american educ __PUNCT__ i had a readi answer __PUNCT__ the nea __PUNCT__
by which i meant the nation educ associ __PUNCT__ that highli politic __PUNCT__ washington __PUNCT__ base union that is a hindranc to student as well as to the teacher it claim to repres __PUNCT__
but you know the nea is not the onli problem __PUNCT__
just like it educ polici __PUNCT__ the democrat parti foreign polici is heavili influenc by anoth left __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ center pressur group __PUNCT__ move __URL__ which impli that our lead gener in iraq betrai us __PUNCT__ that tell our men and women in uniform that the war thei ar fight is lost __PUNCT__ and then tri to cut off fund for our troop in the field __PUNCT__
and it social polici is heavili determin by the radic secularist aclu __PUNCT__ which tri to take god out of the public squar and leap to the legal defens of our nation enemi __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ when i ask which of the current group of democrat candid i prefer to run against __PUNCT__ i alwai sai it realli doesn't matter __PUNCT__
becaus these dai all those candid __PUNCT__ all the democrat leader __PUNCT__ ar on and the same __PUNCT__
thei all nea __PUNCT__ move __URL__ aclu __PUNCT__ michael moor democrat __PUNCT__
thei allow these radic to take control of their parti and dictat their cours __PUNCT__
so thi elect is import not just to enact our conserv principl __PUNCT__
thi elect is import to salvag the onc __PUNCT__ great polit parti from the grip of extrem and shake it back to it sens __PUNCT__
it time to give not just republican but independ and __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ good democrat a chanc to call a halt to the leftward lurch of the onc proud parti of work peopl __PUNCT__
so in seek the nomin of my own parti __PUNCT__ i want to sai someth a littl unusu __PUNCT__
i am ask my fellow republican to vote for me not onli for what i have to sai to them __PUNCT__ but for what i have to sai to the member of the other parti __PUNCT__ the million of democrat who haven't left the democrat parti so much as their parti nation leadership ha left them __PUNCT__
in thi campaign i will be seek the support of million of democrat who no longer believ that thei can trust their own parti leadership on the issu of nation secur __PUNCT__
i will be seek the support of million of democrat with young famili who ar begin to see the econom burden thei mai face becaus of their parti leadership tast for high tax and polit motiv refus to fix social secur and remov the threat of a shortfal in feder benefit plan that could be a catastroph for younger taxpay __PUNCT__
and __PUNCT__ final __PUNCT__ i be seek the support of democrat who ar weari of spin polit and the perman campaign and endless attempt to control the media dynam __PUNCT__ who think polici stanc ought to be judg on a higher criteria than what work better in a sound bite or fit thi week campaign __PUNCT__ messag guidanc __PUNCT__
so i be ask good democrat as well as independ to give us anoth chanc __PUNCT__ to see if a republican presid and congress that dedic to conserv principl can move forward with an agenda that goe beyond narrow partisanship and polit expedi and actual deal with the long __PUNCT__ term foreign and domest crise we face __PUNCT__
i know we can do better than a __NUM__ __PUNCT__ approv rate the current congress had __PUNCT__
and i know we learn our lesson from last year elect __PUNCT__
we the parti of smaller __PUNCT__ smarter govern __PUNCT__ lower tax __PUNCT__ and less washington spend __PUNCT__
and the onli wai we win is if we understand that __PUNCT__ remain true to it __PUNCT__ and refus to yield to those who would have us abandon it __PUNCT__
all of thi __PUNCT__ then __PUNCT__ and more is why i run for presid __PUNCT__
i believ __PUNCT__ that __PUNCT__ ye __PUNCT__ we can deal with the danger and threat befor our nation and the world __PUNCT__
and we can begin now by rememb who we ar __PUNCT__ where we came from __PUNCT__ and what we done befor as a peopl __PUNCT__
thi isn't the first time our nation ha been in grave danger __PUNCT__ even in our own lifetim __PUNCT__
not long ago our wa an east __PUNCT__ west world where the democraci were beleagu and small in number __PUNCT__
now so much that wa onc unimagin is happen befor our ey __PUNCT__
we see a world where repres govern is flourish __PUNCT__
a world where the global econom boom is take million out of poverti everi year __PUNCT__
a world where there even talk of a perman end to poverti __PUNCT__
well __PUNCT__ we got to thi place becaus of leader who saw someth more than polit expedi __PUNCT__ leader like a ronald reagan __PUNCT__
a ronald reagan who would us hi time in offic wise precis becaus he thought polit had higher us than just the pursuit of power __PUNCT__
he spoke often of the abus of govern power that our found father fear and warn against __PUNCT__
you know __PUNCT__ i alwai thought on of the most impress thing about on of those founder __PUNCT__ georg washington __PUNCT__ wa hi willing to walk awai from power __PUNCT__
have spent eight imposs difficult year in a militari struggl against the greatest militari power on earth __PUNCT__ he wa fill with an aw and wonder not at the work of mere mortal but at the work and power of provid __PUNCT__ an aw and wonder that wa never to leav him __PUNCT__
to hi dy dai he wa to remind american that the on condit of a prosper and free peopl wa a belief in a will higher than our own __PUNCT__ a trust in provid __PUNCT__
lincoln had it too __PUNCT__ the convict that no free peopl and certainli no presid can long endur without a belief in a wisdom far exceed ani human understand __PUNCT__
i know the peopl of iowa think that wai __PUNCT__
i recogn it when i see it __PUNCT__
that on of the great advantag that come from grow up in anoth part of the heartland __PUNCT__ lawrenceburg tennesse __PUNCT__
on sundai morn __PUNCT__ my hometown wa a pretti busi place __PUNCT__ peopl on the wai to hear the good new __PUNCT__ the good new that the futur is in better hand than our own __PUNCT__
so __PUNCT__ thank to what i learn in those earli dai i alwai known no matter how much we want it otherwis __PUNCT__ we human aren't in charg __PUNCT__
life is sometim harsh though in teach us that truth __PUNCT__
and all thi wa much on my mind last summer when i decid to run for the presid __PUNCT__
especi as i look around my home at anoth gener __PUNCT__ a three __PUNCT__ year old and a five __PUNCT__ month old __PUNCT__ and thought __PUNCT__ as have so mani of you over the past few year __PUNCT__ about the safe futur i had and how much i want to make that futur a certainti for my children and your __PUNCT__
so for thi reason and all the other i mention __PUNCT__ i hope that you support me in the dai ahead __PUNCT__
i am hope too that you join me in someth that come pretti easi here in __PUNCT__ the heartland __PUNCT__ a prayer of thank for the great thing that have happen in our time __PUNCT__
and a prayer of hope too __PUNCT__
hope that when the histori of our own ag is written it will be said of us what wa said of those befor us __PUNCT__
that we were unswerv in our dedic to the caus of human freedom and digniti __PUNCT__
and that we kept our trust in the will of him who made us __PUNCT__ and who enjoin us to now go forth and make a newer world __PUNCT__ thank you all __PUNCT__
