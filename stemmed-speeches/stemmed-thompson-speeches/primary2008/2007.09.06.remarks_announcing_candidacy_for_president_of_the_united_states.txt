my friend __PUNCT__ i come to you todai to tell you that i intend to run for presid __PUNCT__
i feel deepli that i am do it for the right reason __PUNCT__
i love my countri and i am concern about it futur __PUNCT__
just within the next few year __PUNCT__ some veri seriou challeng ar move toward us that will present a difficult and danger time in the life of our nation __PUNCT__
there ar grave issu affect the safeti and secur of the american peopl and our econom well be __PUNCT__
i go to do my level best in thi campaign to address these problem __PUNCT__
i go to give thi campaign all that i have to give __PUNCT__ and i hope that you will join me __PUNCT__
my stori is an american stori __PUNCT__ like on of mani our countri ha produc __PUNCT__ where a small town kid of modest mean and modest goal grow up to realiz that he ha been a veri lucki person __PUNCT__
lucki to have been born in america __PUNCT__ lucki to have had the parent i had and lucki to have had a few peopl in my life who sometim saw more in me than i saw in myself __PUNCT__
i have seen my countri from a lot of differ vantag point __PUNCT__
i wa a teenag husband and had three wonder children earli __PUNCT__
i have work for minimum wage __PUNCT__ for salari more than i ever thought i would make __PUNCT__ and for everyth in between __PUNCT__
i have had dinner on the factori floor __PUNCT__ while work the graveyard shift __PUNCT__ and i have dine with world leader in foreign capit __PUNCT__
as a lawyer __PUNCT__ i have been a feder prosecutor and a counsel for the waterg committe __PUNCT__
in privat practic a courag woman and the juri trial that we had against a corrupt state administr result in a movi __PUNCT__
i wa ask to plai myself __PUNCT__ which start a most unlik part time film career __PUNCT__
then a senat seat open up in tennesse __PUNCT__
for me it repres an opportun for public servic __PUNCT__ not for a new career as a politician __PUNCT__
so i set asid my law practic and the movi __PUNCT__ place term limit on myself __PUNCT__ and won two elect by __NUM__ point margin in a state that presid clinton carri twice __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ when i first ran __PUNCT__ i advoc the same common sens conserv posit that i hold todai __PUNCT__
thei ar base upon what i believ to be sound conserv first principl __PUNCT__ reflect the natur of man and the wisdom of the ag __PUNCT__
thei ar base upon the convict that our declar of independ and our constitut ar not outdat document that have outliv their us __PUNCT__
it is a recognit that our basic right come from god and not from govern __PUNCT__
that govern should have it power divid __PUNCT__ not onli at the feder level but between the feder govern and the state __PUNCT__
feder is the belief that not everi problem should have a feder solut __PUNCT__
essenti it about freedom __PUNCT__
a govern that is big enough to do everyth for us is power enough to do anyth to us __PUNCT__
these principl lead me to believ in lower tax __PUNCT__ which foster growth and leav more power in the hand of the peopl __PUNCT__
thei also respect free market __PUNCT__ privat properti __PUNCT__ and fair competit __PUNCT__
thei honor the sanctiti of life __PUNCT__ the great truth everi life matter __PUNCT__ and no person is beneath the protect of the law __PUNCT__
these principl made our countri great and we should reded ourselv to them __PUNCT__ not abandon them __PUNCT__
now to my republican friend __PUNCT__ i point out that in __NUM__ we were down after a clinton victori __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ our conserv principl led us to a comeback and major control of the congress __PUNCT__
now you don't want to have to come back from anoth clinton victori __PUNCT__
our countri need us to win next year __PUNCT__ and i am readi to lead that effort __PUNCT__
when i went to the senat __PUNCT__ i want to help accomplish certain thing that i thought were necessari and achiev __PUNCT__
i want to balanc the budget __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ reform welfar __PUNCT__ requir congress to live under the law that thei had impos on other and i want to begin modern of our militari __PUNCT__
we were abl to get those thing done __PUNCT__
i also took a leadership role in the passag of the homeland secur bill __PUNCT__ and block export control legisl that would have allow the sale of our sensit technolog to unreli countri __PUNCT__
as chairman of the government affair committe __PUNCT__ i led an investig and held hear on the failur and shortcom of our govern __PUNCT__
thi result in a two volum work that i publish in __NUM__ entitl __PUNCT__ govern at the brink __PUNCT__ and still avail on the internet __PUNCT__
it outlin these defici and made recommend to cut wast and save billion __PUNCT__
now these problem have onli grown wors sinc that time __PUNCT__
i serv on the intellig committe and saw close up the import of improv our intellig capabl in our fight against terror and got a good sens of other troubl over the horizon __PUNCT__
in __NUM__ i announc that i would not run for re __PUNCT__ elect and i re __PUNCT__ enter privat life __PUNCT__
while my televis work on __PUNCT__ law __PUNCT__ order __PUNCT__ got more attent __PUNCT__ i stai involv in nation secur issu includ servic as chairman of the intern secur advisori board at the state depart __PUNCT__
on of the most reward experi i had wa when presid bush ask me to assist now chief justic john robert through the senat confirm process __PUNCT__
it is veri import that the next presid appoint feder judg who interpret the constitut __PUNCT__ not try to make it fit their own person or polit view __PUNCT__
i have seen both kind of judg __PUNCT__ and i know the differ __PUNCT__
a gui can do a lot of thing and travel the world but find that the most import thing in life occur under hi own roof __PUNCT__
i marri a wonder ladi dure my last year in the senat and the follow year we found out that we were go to be parent __PUNCT__
i knew from the moment i heard the new that we had been bless __PUNCT__
how true it wa __PUNCT__
our littl girl __PUNCT__ hayden __PUNCT__ who will tell you she is three and three __PUNCT__ quarter year old __PUNCT__ now ha a littl brother __PUNCT__
hi name is sammi and he is __NUM__ month old __PUNCT__
earlier thi year when i thought about whether i should enter thi race __PUNCT__ i kept come back to __NUM__ question __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ what kind of countri ar our children and grandchildren go to grow up in and second __PUNCT__ how mani peopl have the opportun to do someth about it __PUNCT__ that lead me here and why i talk to you todai __PUNCT__
on the next presid watch __PUNCT__ our countri will be make decis that will affect our live and our famili far into the futur __PUNCT__
we cannot allow ourselv to becom a weaker __PUNCT__ less prosper and more divid nation __PUNCT__
todai as in past gener __PUNCT__ the fate of million across the world depend on the uniti and resolv of the american peopl __PUNCT__
the specter of weapon of mass destruct in the hand of our worst enemi continu to grow __PUNCT__ and still we have yet to realli come to term with the natur and extent of the threat we ar face from radic islam terror __PUNCT__
these extremist look at thi war as a long struggl that ha been go on for centuri __PUNCT__ thei ar will to take as long as necessari to bring the unit state and our alli to our knee __PUNCT__ while kill hundr of thousand of innoc peopl __PUNCT__ if possibl __PUNCT__
iraq and afghanistan ar current front in thi war and the world watch as our will is test __PUNCT__
our courag as a peopl must match that of the brave men and women in uniform fight for us __PUNCT__
we must do everyth in our power to achiev success and make sure that thei and their famili __PUNCT__ sacrific ar not made in vain __PUNCT__
thei know that if we abandon our effort or appear weak and divid __PUNCT__ we will pai a heavi price for it in the futur __PUNCT__
some of our leader in congress need to understand thi as well __PUNCT__
in thi broader war with thi differ kind of enemi __PUNCT__ our success cannot alwai be measur by battlefield victori __PUNCT__
success will depend upon the determin of the american peopl and that why we win __PUNCT__
there is a courag that come in uniti __PUNCT__
now is the time to show that america unit can overcom ani danger __PUNCT__ and america unit can complet ani mission __PUNCT__
befor the end of my senat servic __PUNCT__ in the year after 9/11 __PUNCT__ i saw the congress of the unit state at it best __PUNCT__ alert to danger and focus on duti __PUNCT__
we need to recov that clariti and convict in matter of nation secur __PUNCT__
the threat of catastroph violenc in america is real and the terrorist aren't go awai of their own accord __PUNCT__
we must deploi everi resourc includ diplomaci __PUNCT__ intellig __PUNCT__ and econom power to defend thi nation and our nation interest __PUNCT__
if i am command in chief __PUNCT__ thi countri will never be left to the merci of terror regim or terror state __PUNCT__
we have challeng on the home front as well __PUNCT__
befor long we will have spent the social secur surplu and will see the __PUNCT__ babi boomer __PUNCT__ begin to retir __PUNCT__
on our present cours __PUNCT__ deficit financ will saddl futur gener with enorm tax __PUNCT__ jeopard our economi and endang our retir program __PUNCT__
the govern account offic __PUNCT__ the comptrol of the unit state __PUNCT__ and conserv and liber economist alik __PUNCT__ tell us that thi path is econom unsustain __PUNCT__
bipartisan leadership must address thi issu as part of a nation convers __PUNCT__ rememb that those yet to be born also have a seat at the tabl __PUNCT__
after all __PUNCT__ it their monei that we ar spend __PUNCT__ and it is econom secur that in the balanc __PUNCT__
other import issu face our countri __PUNCT__
our depend upon foreign oil __PUNCT__ especi from troubl spot in the middl east and elsewher __PUNCT__ endang our nation secur as well as our economi __PUNCT__
for __NUM__ year nearli everi recess ha been associ with a spike in oil price __PUNCT__
what we need is anoth spike in american creativ and innov __PUNCT__
over the past sever year we have had revolut in our commun __PUNCT__ scienc __PUNCT__ and medic field __PUNCT__
we need to reviv that same american know __PUNCT__ how for our energi secur __PUNCT__ along with a willing to avail ourselv of the energi sourc we alreadi have right here at home __PUNCT__
in educ __PUNCT__ school continu to fail our children and endang america futur competit __PUNCT__
increas amount of feder fund and govern mandat have not result in real improv __PUNCT__
the feder govern can assist state and local through grant with fewer string and less bureaucraci but should not take school out of the hand of parent and local offici __PUNCT__
we should encourag the right of parent to choos the school and what best for their child educ __PUNCT__
rise health care cost ar anoth major problem __PUNCT__
we have the best health care in the world but we ar pai more than we should for it __PUNCT__
we have a massiv bureaucraci in both the privat and public health care sector that control cost by dictat what servic we ar allow to get and when __PUNCT__
someon ha to decid what cost ar worth the monei __PUNCT__
it can be the govern __PUNCT__ the insur compani or it can be you __PUNCT__
i think it is best if you __PUNCT__ yourself decid what is best for you and your famili __PUNCT__ with insur that doesn't have to depend on your employ __PUNCT__ coverag that you can take with you if you chang job __PUNCT__ insur that you mai purchas from anywher in the nation for the best valu __PUNCT__
thi would be market driven and would make health insur afford for more american __PUNCT__
when we look to washington __PUNCT__ we see a bureaucrat govern that is increasingli unabl or unwil to carri out basic government function __PUNCT__ includ the fundament respons of secur our border against illeg immigr and enforc our law __PUNCT__
a nation that can't protect it border will no longer be a sovereign nation __PUNCT__
we see a congress more politic and divid than ever and disconnect from the american peopl __PUNCT__
is thi the govern that some would have plai an even greater role in run our live __PUNCT__ we must do better __PUNCT__
i know that reform is possibl in washington becaus i have seen it done __PUNCT__
i do not accept it as a fact of life beyond our power to chang that the feder govern must go on expand more __PUNCT__ tax more __PUNCT__ and spend more forev __PUNCT__
we __PUNCT__ the american peopl __PUNCT__ must assert ourselv __PUNCT__
in time of stress and peril in thi countri histori __PUNCT__ includ world war __PUNCT__ a great depress __PUNCT__ assassin and attack __PUNCT__ other gener have put their differ asid __PUNCT__ rememb their common belief and overcam great obstacl __PUNCT__
and we have come out stronger and wiser for it __PUNCT__
now it our turn __PUNCT__
no on person __PUNCT__ includ the presid __PUNCT__ ha the abil or wisdom to singlehandedli solv these problem __PUNCT__
nor doe on parti __PUNCT__
but togeth the american peopl do __PUNCT__
these problem will be dealt with when our leader come togeth __PUNCT__ as adult __PUNCT__ and honestli seek solut that extend past the next elect cycl __PUNCT__
that will happen when __PUNCT__ and onli when __PUNCT__ the american peopl demand it __PUNCT__
you can do that at the ballot box and no elect is more import than the on for presid __PUNCT__
it demand a leader who understand thi countri __PUNCT__ our peopl and what america prioriti ought to be __PUNCT__
recent __PUNCT__ i talk to a young marin at walter reed hospit __PUNCT__
he had lost both leg in iraq but wa look to the futur __PUNCT__
i ask him what he plan to do __PUNCT__ he said he want to work with a nonprofit organ that wa do a lot to help peopl __PUNCT__
then he look at me and said __PUNCT__ i just thought it wa time i gave someth back __PUNCT__
that young man __PUNCT__ who ha given so much for america and yet still ask to give more __PUNCT__ is typic of the men and women of the unit state arm forc __PUNCT__
our countri ha shed more blood for the freedom of other peopl than all the other countri in the world combin __PUNCT__
we ar steep in the tradit of honor and sacrific for the greater good __PUNCT__
we ar proud of thi heritag __PUNCT__
i believ that american ar onc again readi to achiev thi greater good __PUNCT__ which is noth less than the secur __PUNCT__ prosper __PUNCT__ and uniti of our countri __PUNCT__
that the belief that thi campaign is base upon __PUNCT__
i appreci your support of thi caus and ani contribut you abl to give __PUNCT__
