that is our nation safeti __PUNCT__
that is the men __PUNCT__ women __PUNCT__ and children of thi countri and where it go to be a few year from now __PUNCT__
we live in the era of the suitcas bomb __PUNCT__
we live in an era of the prolifer of weapon of mass destruct __PUNCT__ where a small amount of materi get into the wrong hand can do destruct that we never thought possibl befor __PUNCT__
and thei more like than ever to fall into the hand of our wors enemi __PUNCT__
radic islam ha declar war upon us __PUNCT__
some year ago peopl didn't pai much attent to it __PUNCT__
we didn't even recogn the fact that it happen __PUNCT__ but we know it now __PUNCT__
thei look upon it as someth that been go on for hundr of year and as far as thei concern thei will to take it anoth hundr year as thei method move forward massacr innoc peopl __PUNCT__
bring the soviet union to it knee __PUNCT__ who thei consid the tougher oppon __PUNCT__ and now thei upon us and all those who would befriend us around the world __PUNCT__
iraq is a part of that conflict but iraq is not that conflict __PUNCT__
that conflict will be with us unfortun long after iraq is in our rear view mirror __PUNCT__ and the whole world watch and wait as the determin of the american peopl is test __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ if we show weak and divis we will pai a heavi price for it in the futur __PUNCT__
we must show the determin that we ar go to be unit as an american peopl and do whatev is necessari to prevail not onli in iraq but in the worldwid conflict that li beyond iraq __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we have the bravest young peopl in the world fight for us __PUNCT__ and we have to match their commit and determin here at home __PUNCT__
you talk to them in these hospit __PUNCT__ the on who have been grievous wound __PUNCT__ their biggest concern is get back to the folk that thei left back and concern that their wound ar so great that thei might not be allow to do that __PUNCT__
it magnific __PUNCT__ and everi wake moment of a command __PUNCT__ in __PUNCT__ chief should be to make sure that peopl like that effort ar and their famili sacrific ar not made in vain __PUNCT__
and i don't intend that to be __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ meanwhil __PUNCT__ back at home the politician have been quit busi __PUNCT__ quit busi spend the next gener monei __PUNCT__
pretti soon we will have spent the social secur surplu and the babi boomer will start retir just in a few year from now on the next presid watch __PUNCT__
and of cours it sky __PUNCT__ rocket from there __PUNCT__ and it will result in astronom __PUNCT__ high deficit __PUNCT__ a tax burden on the next gener and gener to come __PUNCT__ and a ruinat of our economi __PUNCT__
everi economist who look at thi includ our own govern offici who ar the watchdog agenc such as the govern account offic sai that thi path is unsustain __PUNCT__
everybodi in washington know it __PUNCT__
you know on of the argument against term limit __PUNCT__ you know i put term limit on myself when i went to the unit state senat and i still think it a pretti good idea to tell you the truth __PUNCT__ but on of the argument against that is look at all the expertis you lose if you had term limit __PUNCT__
is it expertis that we lack or is it lack of will to do the right thing __PUNCT__ i think it is the latter __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ yet the politician kick the can down the road until presum their own retir __PUNCT__ somebodi els problem __PUNCT__
i wonder if our littl kid and our grandchildren and those yet to be born had a seat at the tabl what thei sai about it __PUNCT__ wonder what thei sai to us __PUNCT__
i wonder what thei think about us __PUNCT__
my friend __PUNCT__ we need to deliv a messag to washington that we better than that __PUNCT__
and you can start deliv that messag by elect a presid who will blow the whistl on thi lack of respons __PUNCT__ and i the gui who will do that __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ go fred go __PUNCT__ now there ar a lot of issu that we have a chanc to talk about all across iowa in larg group and small __PUNCT__ i hope __PUNCT__
no wai in on speech to touch on all of them __PUNCT__
i think on thing is import to point out though in my estim __PUNCT__
that is there ar go to be issu regardless of what we come up with in term of an issu list that the next presid cannot forese __PUNCT__ that we can't forese __PUNCT__
some we know about will still be with us __PUNCT__ but there will be new on __PUNCT__
i think it veri import the peopl understand a man principl __PUNCT__ what he measur thing by __PUNCT__ what will be the standard that he appli as issu come befor him __PUNCT__
as far as i concern i still have the same commonsens conserv belief i did when i ran in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
we were abl to win that elect go from on end of that state to the other __PUNCT__ talk about the sanctiti of life __PUNCT__ talk about lower tax __PUNCT__ talk about less regul __PUNCT__ talk about the market economi __PUNCT__ talk about free competit __PUNCT__ talk about respect for privat properti right in thi countri __PUNCT__ talk about free and fair trade and all those thing that make america great __PUNCT__ and if i said then if we just stick with that __PUNCT__ the american peopl agre with these thing __PUNCT__ we just stick with that __PUNCT__ not onli will we be success __PUNCT__ but we continu to be prosper in thi countri __PUNCT__ we been a beacon for all those countri out there who appli those same principl thei all been success __PUNCT__
the american peopl said ye __PUNCT__ __NUM__ wa success __PUNCT__ and surpris a lot of peopl rememb __PUNCT__ clinton kind of clean our clock there for a littl __PUNCT__ we came back strong and got a mandat __PUNCT__ cut tax __PUNCT__ balanc the budget __PUNCT__ pass welfar reform __PUNCT__ and made congress live under the same law as everyon els __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ it __PUNCT__ wa the first thing i did with chuck grasslei wa get that bill pass __PUNCT__ under hi tutelag __PUNCT__ not a bad gui to learn from __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ so i that same gui __PUNCT__ i haven't chang from those principl anywher along the wai __PUNCT__
i the same gui with the same principl that i had when i went back to lawrenceburg and start the first republican club when i got out of law school in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
i the same gui i wa when i came out over the year here campaign for republican candid becaus i thought it wa a good thing for my parti and a good thing for my countri __PUNCT__ and i still think that wai __PUNCT__
but these posit ar base upon certain principl __PUNCT__
i call them first principl __PUNCT__ i call them the principl that our countri wa found upon __PUNCT__ mani year ago __PUNCT__
thei base upon the notion that some thing in thi chang world just don't chang __PUNCT__
it base upon an appreci of human natur __PUNCT__
it base upon the wisdom of the ag __PUNCT__
it base upon the believ that the declar of independ and the constitut of the unit state ar not outmod document that can be cast asid __PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we still get our basic right from god and not from govern __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ we still have a govern where power is divid __PUNCT__ not just at the feder level but between feder and state level __PUNCT__ feder is about freedom __PUNCT__ it about individu freedom __PUNCT__ it about polit freedom __PUNCT__ it about econom freedom __PUNCT__
it about an understand that a govern power enough to give you everyth __PUNCT__ can take awai from you __PUNCT__ anyth __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ it base upon the notion that we want a govern that is limit to the power deleg to it in the constitut __PUNCT__ but a govern that is strong enough to protect our peopl and a govern that is compet enough to do the thing a govern is suppos to be do __PUNCT__ yet more and more we see that is not true __PUNCT__
when i wa chairman of the govern affair committe in __NUM__ i put out a report call __PUNCT__ govern at the brink __PUNCT__ a two volum report __PUNCT__ and i point out just how hopelessli mess up the bureaucraci in our feder govern wa __PUNCT__ and how mani billion of dollar we were wast __PUNCT__
the fact wa that we couldn't get comput to talk to each other __PUNCT__ we couldn't get govern agenc or the govern itself to realli pass an audit __PUNCT__ couldn't live up to the standard we put on privat busi at all __PUNCT__
an outmod civil servic system __PUNCT__ we weren't get enough peopl in that we need with the high tech requir that the futur wa go to bring us __PUNCT__
we made it virtual imposs to get rid of peopl who weren't do their job __PUNCT__ on __PUNCT__ and on __PUNCT__ and on __PUNCT__ and on __PUNCT__
that wa my opinion then and folk i haven't chang my mind a bit __PUNCT__
it even wors than it wa befor __PUNCT__
it go to requir strong leadership to do someth about it becaus now we see it affect nation secur __PUNCT__ now we see it as an excus for not even enforc our border against illeg immigr and we can't toler that in thi countri becaus we know that a countri who cannot secur it own border ultim will not remain a sovereign nation __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that battl in congress over that last immigr bill is the latest in sever piec of evid that demonstr without a shadow of a doubt that there is a major disconnect between washington dc and the american peopl __PUNCT__
becaus we look to congress we see divis __PUNCT__ acrimoni __PUNCT__ disrupt __PUNCT__ look to everyth to the next elect and not the next gener __PUNCT__ short side polit opportun __PUNCT__ here and there __PUNCT__
is thi the govern that our democrat friend sai should plai a larger role in all of our live __PUNCT__ i don't think so __PUNCT__
it kind of iron __PUNCT__ that the democrat ar move more and more toward the western european system of higher tax __PUNCT__ more regul __PUNCT__ and larger govern __PUNCT__ when countri like franc and germani ar move more our wai __PUNCT__ you know thei ought to read the newspap onc in awhil __PUNCT__ some good thing ar happen over there now base upon our tradit principl __PUNCT__
principl that understand that the rule of law underli everyth els in thi countri __PUNCT__ peopl can go in and get a fair shot __PUNCT__ and a fair hear in a fair court __PUNCT__ base upon the law of the constitut __PUNCT__
unfortun the rule of law is violat more by judg themselv more than anyon els __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ that why i wa so happi to stand by chief justic john robert __PUNCT__ side __PUNCT__ he a great chief justic __PUNCT__ but he need some help __PUNCT__
we need anoth on or two __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ if i elect presid of the unit state i will appoint judg who will follow the constitut __PUNCT__ not shape the constitut to fit their own polit or person notion about how societi ought to oper __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ i seen both kind of judg up close __PUNCT__ and i know the differ __PUNCT__ i don't need anybodi to point that out to me __PUNCT__
my friend thi is what i believ __PUNCT__ and have believ __PUNCT__ and will continu to as best for our countri __PUNCT__
i think it what you believ __PUNCT__
i think that what the american peopl believ __PUNCT__
just as when i first start out in polit __PUNCT__
i don't think their opinion about the basic have chang __PUNCT__
it might look like our side opinion everi onc and awhil ha chang __PUNCT__
but the american peopl __PUNCT__ haven't __PUNCT__
whatev the issu ar that we face __PUNCT__ whether we talk about health care __PUNCT__ or educ __PUNCT__ or energi __PUNCT__ all those import thing __PUNCT__ the applic of those first principl __PUNCT__ the applic of those common sens conserv belief will result in a stronger and stronger nation __PUNCT__
that what thi is all about __PUNCT__ that why i here todai __PUNCT__ and that why you here todai __PUNCT__
we ar citizen of the greatest nation on earth __PUNCT__ and that make us the luckiest peopl on earth __PUNCT__
that carri with it certain oblig __PUNCT__ oblig to do everyth that we can that it remain the greatest nation on earth and that we leav thi place littl better than we came into it __PUNCT__
that what it all about __PUNCT__
you know you look back over our histori __PUNCT__ and it doesn't take you long to realiz that our peopl have shed more blood for other peopl __PUNCT__ liberti than ani other combin of nation in the histori of the world __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ frankli i a littl tire of other peopl __PUNCT__ need to apolog for it __PUNCT__
i don't think we have anyth to apolog for __PUNCT__
we ar steep in the tradit of honor and sacrific for the greater good __PUNCT__
we ar proud of that heritag __PUNCT__ i think thi time in america histori american ar onc again readi to do the thing necessari to achiev that greater good __PUNCT__
that greater good is noth less than the secur __PUNCT__ prosper and uniti of the greatest nation in the world __PUNCT__
i think most american still share those ideal and principl __PUNCT__ and if we appli them and stai true __PUNCT__ it doesn't matter what the pundit sai todai __PUNCT__ we will win next year when it count __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ applaus __PUNCT__ my friend __PUNCT__ our countri need us to win __PUNCT__ our countri need us to win __PUNCT__ i am readi to lead that fight __PUNCT__ let us do it togeth __PUNCT__
