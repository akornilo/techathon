i don't think that my friend senat coburn of oklahoma will mind if i disclos a privat convers i had with him a while back __PUNCT__
he said __PUNCT__ you know __PUNCT__ on of the great moral issu of thi dai is the fact that we bankrupt the next gener __PUNCT__
our economi is go fine now __PUNCT__
we had __NUM__ success quarter of growth becaus of the tax cut and becaus of the strong economi and becaus of the free market that we oper in __PUNCT__ and we thank for that __PUNCT__
not enough credit is given for that and why it come about __PUNCT__
but if you look down the road a littl bit __PUNCT__ we understand that all of the economist from the left or the right __PUNCT__ includ the comptrol of the unit state and the head of the govern account offic __PUNCT__ everyon __PUNCT__ sai that our path with regard to entitl program is unsustain __PUNCT__ it will not work __PUNCT__
we go to run out __PUNCT__ and we ar now borrow against and we be increasingli borrow against the next gener __PUNCT__
and those who ar too small or those who ar yet to be born do not have a seat at thi tabl as we kick the can down the road and wait for somebodi els to take care of the problem __PUNCT__ when it be much wors and much more difficult to take care of __PUNCT__ when those benefit for the retir peopl start be slash or those tax ar rais substanti on young work peopl who will be fund these program __PUNCT__ just as thei go out and get marri and try to start their own famili __PUNCT__
