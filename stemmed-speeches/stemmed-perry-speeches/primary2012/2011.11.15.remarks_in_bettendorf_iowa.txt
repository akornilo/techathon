governor brownback not onli ha the perspect of a leader in america heartland __PUNCT__ but wa a unit state senat __PUNCT__ where he had an up __PUNCT__ close view of just how broken washington is __PUNCT__ and ha wit washington encroach on the __NUM__ amend from both perspect __PUNCT__
he share my desir for fundament reform in washington __PUNCT__ and i am delight to be join by him todai here in iowa __PUNCT__
the issu thi elect is not whether washington is broken __PUNCT__ but how we go about fix it __PUNCT__
there ar two approach __PUNCT__ and even my own parti is split __PUNCT__
there ar some who want to tinker with the statu quo __PUNCT__
thei want to work within the current system to achiev margin chang __PUNCT__
then there ar those who believ __PUNCT__ as i do __PUNCT__ that washington is too broken to be fix by tinker on the margin __PUNCT__
i do not believ washington need a new coat of paint __PUNCT__ it need a complet overhaul __PUNCT__
we need to uproot __PUNCT__ tear down and rebuild washington __PUNCT__ d.c __PUNCT__ and our feder institut __PUNCT__
we should appli the wisdom of solomon to washington __PUNCT__
ecclesiast __PUNCT__ chapter __NUM__ sai __PUNCT__ there is a time to plant and a time to uproot __PUNCT__ there is a time to tear down and a time to build __PUNCT__
it is time to tear down the monument to bureaucrat failur __PUNCT__ and in their place build a smaller __PUNCT__ more effici feder govern that put the american peopl first __PUNCT__
the washington insid won't address beltwai decai __PUNCT__ thei won't try a total new wai __PUNCT__ becaus thei like thing as thei ar __PUNCT__
the lobbyist make their live on protect corpor loophol __PUNCT__ and secur earmark for the special interest thei repres __PUNCT__
the statu quo is good to the washington insid __PUNCT__
it good to the overpaid bureaucrat __PUNCT__
it good for the power __PUNCT__ player who can trade favor to build fiefdom of influenc __PUNCT__
while the rest of america remain mire in the ruin caus by washington out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ touch __PUNCT__ big govern econom polici __PUNCT__ washington is do fine __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the washington metro area is now the most affluent metropolitan area in the countri __PUNCT__
that becaus all the lobbyist __PUNCT__ contractor and over __PUNCT__ paid czar and bureaucrat haven't suffer on bit in the worst economi in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
while main street window have been board up __PUNCT__ the cash continu to flow to wall street financi and beltwai profit __PUNCT__
let me ask you a question __PUNCT__ if you found out the hous you built had crumbl wall __PUNCT__ faulti wire __PUNCT__ and a leaki roof __PUNCT__ would you call in the origin incompet builder to fix it __PUNCT__ and if it wa fundament flaw __PUNCT__ would you add on to the same faulti structur __PUNCT__ or would you tear it down __PUNCT__ and re __PUNCT__ build again with a total new crew __PUNCT__ our countri foundat __PUNCT__ the american peopl and the unit state constitut __PUNCT__ is still strong __PUNCT__
it what the politician and bureaucrat have built upon that foundat __PUNCT__ on the back of american taxpay __PUNCT__ that must be replac and rebuilt __PUNCT__
those who got us into thi mess will not get us out __PUNCT__
those who increas the debt __MONEY__ trillion in three year cannot be trust to bring in a new era of fiscal auster __PUNCT__
those who made the econom crisi wors do not have the capac to make it better __PUNCT__
in recent week our presid ha taken to point the finger of blame instead of take respons __PUNCT__
he ha call us soft and lazi __PUNCT__ and he ha said american lack ambit and imagin __PUNCT__
mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ american aren't soft or lazi __PUNCT__ and american do not lack ambit of imagin __PUNCT__ washington ha fail us __PUNCT__
we need new leadership __PUNCT__
we need a new builder __PUNCT__
we need a washington outsid __PUNCT__
uniqu to the republican field __PUNCT__ i have never been an establish figur __PUNCT__ have never serv in congress or part of an administr __PUNCT__ and have never been a paid lobbyist __PUNCT__
my career ha been that of a washington outsid __PUNCT__
here is my plan to fix our three broken branch of govern __PUNCT__
part on of my plan is to reform the feder judiciari by end life term for unelect feder judg __PUNCT__
too mani feder judg rule with impun from the bench __PUNCT__ and those who legisl from the bench should not be entitl to lifetim abus of their judici author __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ futur appointe to the feder bench will not receiv a lifetim appoint __PUNCT__
part two involv deconstruct the perman polit class in the legisl branch __PUNCT__
congress is out of touch becaus congressmen ar overpaid __PUNCT__ over __PUNCT__ staf and awai from home too much __PUNCT__
american have had enough __PUNCT__
it time to creat a part __PUNCT__ time congress where their pai is cut in half __PUNCT__ their offic budget ar cut in half __PUNCT__ and their time in washington is cut in half __PUNCT__
and if thei do not submit a budget that balanc by __NUM__ as my plan call for __PUNCT__ we should cut their pai in half again __PUNCT__
and when i take offic __PUNCT__ we will work to freez congression and agenc salari until the budget is balanc __PUNCT__
we have a lot of well __PUNCT__ intent member of congress __PUNCT__
but thei have becom creatur of washington __PUNCT__
thei get paid more than three time the averag american famili __PUNCT__ and thei have doubl their own budget in the last decad __PUNCT__
thei ar complet detach from the peopl __PUNCT__ who ar struggl to get by __PUNCT__ and can't vote to rais their own pai __PUNCT__
some have even abus the public trust __PUNCT__ trade on insid inform to pad their stock portfolio __PUNCT__
congress ha proven it can't be trust to watch our monei __PUNCT__ and now it clear thei can't be trust with their __PUNCT__
ani congressman or senat that us their insid knowledg to profit in the stock market ought to be sent to jail __PUNCT__ period __PUNCT__
and my plan make that clear __PUNCT__
but in realiti __PUNCT__ thei shouldn't wait until we have a new presid __PUNCT__ thei ought to pass a law right now that crimin insid trade in congress __PUNCT__ no if __PUNCT__ and or but __PUNCT__
we send member of congress to look out for america __PUNCT__ not enrich themselv __PUNCT__
but too often __PUNCT__ thei ar taken captiv by the washington cultur __PUNCT__
that why we need a part __PUNCT__ time congress __PUNCT__
i sai send them home to live under the law thei pass among the peopl thei repres __PUNCT__
further __PUNCT__ we must chang the spend cultur in congress __PUNCT__
no more bailout of banker __PUNCT__ no more earmark for pet project __PUNCT__ and no more spend beyond our mean __PUNCT__
i will bring spend down to __NUM__ percent of gdp __PUNCT__ the averag amount of the last __NUM__ year __PUNCT__
and i will fight in everi corner of thi countri for a balanc budget amend to the us constitut __PUNCT__
and two more point on spend __PUNCT__ no longer will we prop up fail entiti like fanni mae and freddi mac __PUNCT__ which were at the heart of the econom collaps becaus of mortgag financ polici that gave fals confid to homebuy who have now default or ar under water __PUNCT__
we will privat fanni and freddi so politician can no longer politic them __PUNCT__ and taxpay will no longer be fleec by them __PUNCT__
and lastli __PUNCT__ we will put a perman stop to feder fund of plan parenthood becaus our tax dollar should never be us in take an innoc __PUNCT__ unborn life __PUNCT__
the third part of my plan involv the dismantl and rebuild of the perman bureaucraci __PUNCT__
we will elimin agenc that perform redund function __PUNCT__
i will get rid of the commerc depart __PUNCT__ the depart of educ __PUNCT__ and the depart of energi __PUNCT__
we will downsiz and re __PUNCT__ task the epa so it no longer torment job creator or give an offici stamp to phoni scienc __PUNCT__
we will end the tsa harass of law __PUNCT__ abid travel and return transport secur to the privat sector __PUNCT__
and we will restructur the behemoth that ha becom the depart of homeland secur __PUNCT__
we will perform a full audit of the feder govern __PUNCT__ and there will be no sacr cow __PUNCT__ includ wast spend at the depart of defens __PUNCT__ where everi dollar we spend should support our warfight around the world __PUNCT__
we will put a moratorium on everi pend feder regul __PUNCT__ and order a full audit of the last five year of new regul __PUNCT__ repeal those that ar not afford __PUNCT__ effect or that kill job __PUNCT__
and we will sai to everi bureaucrat except our militari and law enforc __PUNCT__ no salari increas until the feder budget is balanc __PUNCT__
and becaus a presid must lead by exampl __PUNCT__ we should cut hi salari in half until the budget is balanc __PUNCT__
washington is so broken __PUNCT__ american will accept noth less than a complet overhaul of the wai busi is done in america __PUNCT__
american know there is a season for everyth under the sun __PUNCT__
and thi is the season for tear down and rebuild again __PUNCT__ for uproot the broken branch of govern in washington __PUNCT__ and build a new govern that is smaller and more humbl __PUNCT__ so america can be stronger and freer again __PUNCT__
