but it wasn't until i graduat from texa a&m univers and join the unit state air forc __PUNCT__ fly c __PUNCT__ __NUM__ all around the globe __PUNCT__ that i truli appreci the bless of freedom __PUNCT__
to paraphras abraham lincoln and ronald reagan __PUNCT__ i realiz that the unit state of america realli is the last great hope of mankind __PUNCT__
what i saw wa system of govern that elev ruler at the expens of the peopl __PUNCT__
socialist system cloak mayb in good intent but were deliv miseri and stagnat __PUNCT__
and i learn that not everyon valu life like we do in america __PUNCT__ or the right that ar endow to everi human be by a love god __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ as american we not defin by class __PUNCT__ and we will never be told our place __PUNCT__
what make our nation except is that anyon __PUNCT__ from ani background __PUNCT__ can climb the highest of height __PUNCT__
as american __PUNCT__ we don't see the role of govern as guarante outcom __PUNCT__ but allow free men and women to flourish base on their own vision __PUNCT__ their hard work and their person respons __PUNCT__
and as american __PUNCT__ we realiz there is no taxpay monei that wasn't first earn by the sweat and toil of on of our citizen __PUNCT__
that why we reject thi presid unbridl fixat on take more monei out of the wallet and pocketbook of american famili and employ and give it to a central govern __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__ spread the wealth __PUNCT__ punish success while set america on cours to greater depend on govern __PUNCT__
washington insati desir to spend our children inherit on fail __PUNCT__ stimulu __PUNCT__ plan and other misguid econom theori have given us record debt and left us with far too mani unemploi __PUNCT__
but of cours __PUNCT__ now we told we ar in recoveri __PUNCT__
yeah __PUNCT__
but thi sure doesn't feel like a recoveri to more than nine percent of american out there who ar unemploi __PUNCT__ or the sixteen percent of african american and __NUM__ percent of hispan in the same posit __PUNCT__ or the million more who can onli find part __PUNCT__ time work __PUNCT__ or those who have stop even look for a job __PUNCT__
on in six work __PUNCT__ elig american cannot find a full __PUNCT__ time job __PUNCT__
that is not a recoveri __PUNCT__
that is an econom disast __PUNCT__
if you think about it __PUNCT__ for those american who do have full __PUNCT__ time job __PUNCT__ thei aren't experienc econom recoveri with the rise fuel cost and the food price that ar go up __PUNCT__
recoveri is a meaningless word if the bank ha foreclos on your home __PUNCT__ if you ar under water on your mortgag __PUNCT__ or if you ar up to the max on your credit card debt __PUNCT__
those american know that thi presid and hi big __PUNCT__ spend __PUNCT__ big __PUNCT__ govern polici have prolong our nation miseri __PUNCT__ not allevi it __PUNCT__
and what do we sai to our children __PUNCT__ y'all figur it out __PUNCT__ don't worri __PUNCT__ washington creat __NUM__ debt and entitl commiss in __NUM__ year __PUNCT__ but the fact of the matter is thei just didn't have the courag to make the decis to allow you to have the futur that you actual deserv __PUNCT__ that washington wouldn't even make modest entitl program reform in thi last debat __PUNCT__ and the presid even refus to lai out a plan __PUNCT__ for fear of the next elect __PUNCT__ how can the wealthiest nation in the histori of civil fail so miser to pai it bill __PUNCT__ how doe that happen __PUNCT__ well __PUNCT__ mr __PUNCT__ presid __PUNCT__ let us tell you someth __PUNCT__ you can't win the futur by sell america off to foreign creditor __PUNCT__
we cannot afford four more year of thi rudderless leadership __PUNCT__
last week __PUNCT__ that leadership fail __PUNCT__ and the tax and spend and borrow agenda of thi presid led to the first ever downgrad of the credit rate of the unit state of america __PUNCT__
in realiti though __PUNCT__ thi is just the most recent downgrad __PUNCT__
the fact is for nearli three year presid obama ha been downgrad american job __PUNCT__
he been downgrad our stand in the world __PUNCT__
he been downgrad our financi stabil __PUNCT__
he been downgrad our confid __PUNCT__ and downgrad the hope for a better futur for our children __PUNCT__
that a fact __PUNCT__
hi polici ar not onli a threat to thi economi __PUNCT__ so ar hi appointe __PUNCT__ a threat __PUNCT__
you see he stack the nation labor relat board with anti __PUNCT__ busi croni who want to dictat to a privat compani __PUNCT__ boe __PUNCT__ where thei can build a plant __PUNCT__
no presid __PUNCT__ no presid should kill job in south carolina __PUNCT__ or ani other state for that matter __PUNCT__ simpli becaus thei choos to go to a right __PUNCT__ to __PUNCT__ work state __PUNCT__
you see __PUNCT__ when the obama administr is not stifl econom growth with over __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__ thei ar achiev the same through their reckless spend __PUNCT__
debt is not onli a threat to our economi __PUNCT__ but also to our secur __PUNCT__
america stand in the world is in peril __PUNCT__ not onli becaus of disastr econom polici __PUNCT__ but from the incoher muddl that thei call foreign polici __PUNCT__
our presid ha insult our friend and he encourag our enemi __PUNCT__ thumb hi nose at tradit alli like israel __PUNCT__
he seek to dictat new border for the middl east and the oldest democraci there __PUNCT__ israel __PUNCT__ while he is an abject failur in hi constitut duti to protect our border in the unit state __PUNCT__
hi foreign polici seem to be base on alien our tradit alli __PUNCT__ while base our domest agenda on import those fail western european social valu __PUNCT__
we don't need a presid who apolog for america __PUNCT__
we need a presid who protect and project those valu __PUNCT__
look __PUNCT__ it pretti simpl __PUNCT__ we go to stand with those who stand with us __PUNCT__ and we will vigor defend our interest __PUNCT__
and those who threaten our interest __PUNCT__ harm our citizen __PUNCT__ we will simpli not be scold you __PUNCT__ we will defeat you __PUNCT__
