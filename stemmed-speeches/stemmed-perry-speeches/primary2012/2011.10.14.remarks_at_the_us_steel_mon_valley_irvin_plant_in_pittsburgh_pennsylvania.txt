and __NUM__ percent of american household have at least on resid receiv govern benefit __PUNCT__
though our presid ha label american as soft __PUNCT__ i believ our peopl have tough it out the best thei can __PUNCT__
but thei ar look for leadership and optim __PUNCT__ which ar all too rare in washington todai __PUNCT__

through a seri of execut order __PUNCT__ and other execut action __PUNCT__ we will begin the process of creat job soon after the inaugur of a new presid __PUNCT__

and in a matter of dai i will offer to the american peopl a broader packag of econom reform that i will take to congress when i am elect presid __PUNCT__
my complet econom growth packag will tackl tax reform __PUNCT__ entitl reform and real spend reduct in order to address our grow debt crisi __PUNCT__
but todai i offer a plan that will creat more than a million good __PUNCT__ american job across everi sector of the economi and enhanc our nation secur __PUNCT__ and the best new is it can be set in motion in my first __NUM__ dai __PUNCT__
my plan is base on thi simpl premis __PUNCT__ make what american bui __PUNCT__ bui what american make __PUNCT__ and sell it to the world __PUNCT__
we ar stand atop the next american econom __URL__
the quickest wai to give our economi a shot in the arm is to deploi american ingenu to tap american energi __PUNCT__
but we can onli do that if environment bureaucrat ar told to stand down __PUNCT__
my plan will break the grip of depend we have todai on foreign oil from hostil nation like venezuela and unstabl nation in the middl east to grow job and our economi at home __PUNCT__
america ha proven but untap suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__ oil and coal __PUNCT__
america is the saudi arabia of coal with __NUM__ percent of the world suppli __PUNCT__
our countri contain up to __NUM__ billion barrel of oil and nearli __NUM__ quadrillion cubic feet of natur ga __PUNCT__
we have the resourc we need to fuel our car __PUNCT__ our home and our power plant __PUNCT__
thei can be found in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ west virginia __PUNCT__ ohio __PUNCT__ texa __PUNCT__ oklahoma __PUNCT__ north dakota __PUNCT__ new mexico __PUNCT__ alabama __PUNCT__ kentucki throughout the american west and __PUNCT__ of cours __PUNCT__ alaska __PUNCT__
but presid obama and hi over __PUNCT__ reach environment protect agenc won't allow american busi and american labor to draw on even a fraction of thi domest energi from reserv on govern __PUNCT__ own land __PUNCT__
on on hand __PUNCT__ the obama administr oppos fossil fuel develop at home __PUNCT__ and then on the other hand encourag countri like brazil to drill offshor and sell it to american consum __PUNCT__ creat foreign job and foreign profit that wrong __PUNCT__
that hypocrit __PUNCT__
that unfair __PUNCT__
america should not be __PUNCT__ and when i am presid will not be __PUNCT__ held hostag by foreign oil and feder bureaucrat __PUNCT__
the american economi should not be beaten into the ground when greater energi independ and lower energi cost lie right under american soil __PUNCT__
my plan will creat job in everi sector __PUNCT__ revit manufactur __PUNCT__ and contain the cost of electr and fuel through four concret action __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ we will open sever american oil and ga field for explor that ar current off limit becaus of polit consider __PUNCT__
the current administr ha restrict explor in the gulf of mexico __PUNCT__ alaska __PUNCT__ and the mid __PUNCT__ atlant __PUNCT__
in the gulf of mexico __PUNCT__ the median time for review of permit for combin deepwat explor and develop ha increas __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__ while deepwat explor and develop plan approv have drop by nearli __NUM__ percent __PUNCT__
the depart of interior ha stop off __PUNCT__ shore explor off the coast of virginia over the object of the virginia congression deleg __PUNCT__ which ha pass a bill in the hous to achiev the will of their peopl __PUNCT__
that bill is also support by their democrat senat __PUNCT__ webb and warner __PUNCT__
with a seri of execut order and other execut action __PUNCT__ i will author the follow __PUNCT__ i will work to open up alaska abund resourc to oil and ga explor __PUNCT__ includ the anwr coastal plain and the nation petroleum reserv of alaska __PUNCT__
in thi on instanc __PUNCT__ we will need congression author __PUNCT__
but it is worth it when you consid we will creat __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
we will initi off __PUNCT__ shore explor in the beaufort and chukchi sea off the northern and western coast of alaska __PUNCT__
thi will creat __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
we will resum pre __PUNCT__ obama level of explor in the gulf of mexico and creat anoth __NUM__ job __PUNCT__
i will support the construct of the keyston xl pipelin to take canadian crude to coastal refineri __PUNCT__ which would creat __NUM__ direct job for american worker __PUNCT__
we will begin tap the energi potenti of the american west __PUNCT__ open up feder and privat land for explor in state like wyom __PUNCT__ montana __PUNCT__ new mexico __PUNCT__ north dakota __PUNCT__ colorado and utah __PUNCT__
collect __PUNCT__ our western state have the potenti to produc __NUM__ million barrel of oil per dai by __NUM__ and contain __NUM__ trillion cubic feet of natur ga __PUNCT__
thei can produc more energi than what we import from saudi arabia __PUNCT__ iraq __PUNCT__ kuwait __PUNCT__ venezuela and russia combin __PUNCT__ and right here in pennsylvania __PUNCT__ and across the state line in west virginia and ohio __PUNCT__ we will tap the full potenti of the marcellu shale and creat anoth __NUM__ job by get the epa out of the wai __PUNCT__
while marcellu shale is todai opportun __PUNCT__ the deeper utica shale format offer equal vast potenti with more job over the horizon for pennsylvania and it neighbor __PUNCT__
the benefit of the boom in american natur ga product ar also demonstr in manufactur and product __PUNCT__
we see that right here at u. __PUNCT__ steel mon vallei work plant that emploi more than three thousand worker __PUNCT__ mani of whom make the steel product other compani us to develop the marcellu shale todai __PUNCT__
the face of manufactur in industri state ha chang rapidli __PUNCT__
natur ga explor is a game __PUNCT__ changer that can bring new opportun to replac the on that have been lost __PUNCT__
develop of natur ga will creat job in the suppli chain and lead to lower energi cost for manufactur __PUNCT__
western pennsylvania is known for produc great quarterback i want western pennsylvania to quarterback a new energi revolut that creat job all across america __PUNCT__
not onli will we creat job by expand energi explor __PUNCT__ we will us the revenu gener to pai down the deficit __PUNCT__
at the same time __PUNCT__ where america ha ecolog treasur __PUNCT__ like the everglad or yellowston nation park __PUNCT__ we will not explor for energi __PUNCT__
as we roll back feder control __PUNCT__ we seek greater cooper with the state __PUNCT__
and if state oppos energi explor __PUNCT__ we will respect that decis __PUNCT__
but these instanc repres the except __PUNCT__ not the rule __PUNCT__
it is equal import that we take a second step __PUNCT__ elimin activist regul alreadi on the book and under consider by the obama administr __PUNCT__
while presid obama ha been veri public about hi newest job propos __PUNCT__ behind the scene the perman bureaucraci is work to grind the economi to a halt in pursuit of activist regul __PUNCT__
a raft of new rule and foot __PUNCT__ drag by the epa and interior depart ar kill job creation __PUNCT__
exampl includ the util maximum avail control technolog rule __PUNCT__ the boiler mact rule __PUNCT__ the cross state air pollut rule __PUNCT__ the propos coal combust residu regul and section __NUM__ __PUNCT__ b __PUNCT__ of the clean water act __PUNCT__
these new rule alon could destroi up to __NUM__ million american job by __NUM__ and add __MONEY__ billion in cost to electr provid and consum __PUNCT__
under my plan __PUNCT__ each of these rule would be subject to an immedi review with a cost __PUNCT__ benefit analysi to determin the impact on american employ and the environ __PUNCT__
if we face the fact __PUNCT__ we know that none of these rule were need to reduc emiss of the six princip pollut by __NUM__ percent sinc __NUM__ __PUNCT__
and thei ar not need now __PUNCT__ especi as our economi hang in a fragil balanc between recoveri and recess __PUNCT__
i will take anoth step import to econom growth __PUNCT__ i will stop the epa draconian measur relat to the regul of greenhous gase __PUNCT__
when you consid that ani carbon reduct will be offset by the increas of carbon emiss by develop nation like china and india __PUNCT__ the epa would tie our economi in knot and advantag our global competitor while realiz no global environment benefit in the process __PUNCT__
the third part of my plan is to reform the bureaucraci __PUNCT__ in particular the epa __PUNCT__ so that it focus on region and cross __PUNCT__ state issu __PUNCT__ provid scientif research __PUNCT__ as well as environment analysi and cost __PUNCT__ comparison studi to support state environment organ __PUNCT__
we will return greater regulatori author to the state to manag air and water qualiti rather than impos on __PUNCT__ size __PUNCT__ fit __PUNCT__ all feder rule __PUNCT__
i reject the notion that washington is more commit to environment stewardship than state and local offici who must live with the consequ of their own environment polici __PUNCT__
the fourth compon of my plan is to level the competit plai field among all energi produc __PUNCT__
as the governor of the nation lead produc of wind energi __PUNCT__ i clearli believ there is an import role for green sourc of energi as a part of our gener mix __PUNCT__
the fact is __PUNCT__ everi energi produc receiv incent and subsidi that cost taxpay and distort the marketplac __PUNCT__
my plan will stop the practic of washington write subsidi check to ani and all sector of the energi industri __PUNCT__
it will also stop industri __PUNCT__ specif tax credit __PUNCT__ phase out both over a period of time __PUNCT__ allow the market time to adjust __PUNCT__
we will __PUNCT__ howev __PUNCT__ preserv tax incent for research and develop __PUNCT__
we believ the best wai to invest in emerg technolog is to allow privat industri the freedom to develop it __PUNCT__
the shock realiti concern obama energi polici is high energi price ar not an accid __PUNCT__ but intent __PUNCT__
from an energi secretari who said he want european price for fuel __PUNCT__ to a presid who said it wa necessari to rais the price of electr __PUNCT__ thi administr ha intention sought to make convent gener from coal and natur ga more costli __PUNCT__ take more out of the pocket of american famili __PUNCT__
and the reason why is thei want to drive consum to green energi __PUNCT__
but we don't produc enough green energi to fill the void __PUNCT__ so the result is greater relianc on foreign sourc of energi __PUNCT__
increas the us of green energi is a laudabl goal __PUNCT__
we have done it successfulli in my state __PUNCT__
but we have us renew sourc to expand the energi suppli not replac convent gener __PUNCT__
natur ga and coal ar respons for roughli two __PUNCT__ third of the electr gener in thi countri __PUNCT__
how can we have stabl and afford electr when feder agenc target america top two fuel gener sourc for electr __PUNCT__ hostil to coal is not confin to thi administr __PUNCT__ it ha wrongli been target by some member of my own parti __PUNCT__
i take a differ view __PUNCT__ i welcom the continu develop of coal as an import part of job creation in america __PUNCT__
allow industri to invest in research and develop is the best wai to pursu clean coal technolog __PUNCT__
i do not accept the fals choic that we must pick between energi and the environ __PUNCT__
it is time for a balanc __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ american __PUNCT__ pro __PUNCT__ job energi polici __PUNCT__
technolog in place todai __PUNCT__ and under develop __PUNCT__ can ensur cleaner develop of convent sourc __PUNCT__
the epa war on american fossil fuel product come despit the fact thei can't point to a singl incid of unsaf hydraul fractur of natur ga __PUNCT__
if thei have their wai in shut down ga and coal product __PUNCT__ the obama legaci will be more than __NUM__ million energi job lost in oil __PUNCT__ ga and coal __PUNCT__
the choic thi elect is between two veri differ vision for our countri __PUNCT__
when it come to energi __PUNCT__ the presid would kill domest job through aggress regul __PUNCT__ while i would creat __NUM__ million american job through safe and aggress energi explor at home __PUNCT__
presid obama would keep us more depend on hostil sourc of foreign energi __PUNCT__ while my plan would make us more secur by tap america true energi potenti __PUNCT__
hi energi polici ar driven by the concern of activist in hi parti __PUNCT__ my polici ar driven by the concern of american worker without job __PUNCT__
we must get america work again __PUNCT__
a big part of the solut is under our feet and off our coast __PUNCT__
it can be done without be mire in washington gridlock __PUNCT__ becaus a presid ha all the author he need to rollback intrus regul __PUNCT__ creat energi job __PUNCT__ and make our nation more secur __PUNCT__
creat job in america is as simpl as chang presid __PUNCT__
that is the choic face american __PUNCT__
america need job __PUNCT__
america need energi __PUNCT__
america need a __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ energi revolut __PUNCT__
i have the long __PUNCT__ time experi and track record of success in thi critic area for american job and econom growth to creat a new wave of american independ __PUNCT__ energi independ __PUNCT__
end the over __PUNCT__ regul __PUNCT__
end the excess litig __PUNCT__
end the bureaucrat intimid __PUNCT__
let get back to what work to get america work again __PUNCT__
make what american bui __PUNCT__ bui what american make __PUNCT__ and sell it to the world __PUNCT__
__PUNCT__
