the first pillar of my plan is a __PUNCT__ made in america __PUNCT__ energi polici that make our nation more secur and creat american job by reduc our relianc on foreign oil __PUNCT__
america ha proven but untap suppli of natur ga __PUNCT__ oil and coal __PUNCT__
america is the saudi arabia of coal __PUNCT__ with __NUM__ percent of the world suppli __PUNCT__
our countri contain up to __NUM__ billion barrel of oil __PUNCT__ and nearli __NUM__ quadrillion cubic feet of natur ga __PUNCT__
we have the resourc we need to fuel our car __PUNCT__ our home and our power plant __PUNCT__

but presid obama and hi over __PUNCT__ reach environment protect agenc won't allow american busi and american labor to draw on even a fraction of thi domest energi from reserv on govern __PUNCT__ own land __PUNCT__
on on hand __PUNCT__ the obama administr oppos fossil fuel develop at home __PUNCT__ and then on the other hand encourag countri like brazil to drill offshor and sell it to american consum __PUNCT__ creat foreign job and foreign profit __PUNCT__
that wrong __PUNCT__
that hypocrit __PUNCT__
that unfair __PUNCT__
in my first dai in offic __PUNCT__ i will revers depart of interior polici that prohibit explor on feder land and in feder water __PUNCT__
we will work with congress to open up anwr __PUNCT__ we will resum pre __PUNCT__ obama level of explor in the gulf __PUNCT__ and we will allow our western state to tap into the massiv suppli of energi thei possess so the west coast isn't so depend on hostil sourc of foreign energi __PUNCT__
we will review and put a halt to job __PUNCT__ kill epa rule that ar grind our economi to a halt __PUNCT__
we will remak the epa __PUNCT__ focus that agenc on region issu while return state environment issu to state polici __PUNCT__ maker __PUNCT__
and we will stop the subsidi and stop the tax credit for specif industri so we have a true energi marketplac with a level plai field __PUNCT__
america need job __PUNCT__

the fastest wai to get our economi go is to expand energi explor becaus for the most part __PUNCT__ it can be done without congression gridlock __PUNCT__
a presid can make these chang through execut order and execut action __PUNCT__
but our long __PUNCT__ term growth strategi requir fundament reform of our tax code __PUNCT__ the spend cultur __PUNCT__ and the wai busi is done in washington __PUNCT__
in six dai __PUNCT__ i will releas the detail of an econom growth packag that will creat job __PUNCT__ creat growth __PUNCT__ and creat investor confid in america again __PUNCT__
it start with scrap the three million word of the current tax code __PUNCT__ and start over with someth much simpler __PUNCT__ a flat tax __PUNCT__
i want to make the tax code so simpl that even timothi geithner can file hi tax on time __PUNCT__
the second part of my plan involv a seriou commit to spend cut __PUNCT__ realiz the altern is the path of greec and other european nation that have been sunk by sovereign debt __PUNCT__
we will reform entitl __PUNCT__ while preserv benefit for todai retire and those close to retir __PUNCT__
we will put forward a plan that balanc the budget __PUNCT__ and to keep our countri on cours to futur balanc budget __PUNCT__ i will barnstorm all fifti state to gener support for a balanc budget amend that will requir the necessari tough choic year after year __PUNCT__
lastli __PUNCT__ we will chang the wai busi is done in washington __PUNCT__ and it will start by end the __PUNCT__ do as i sai __PUNCT__ not as i do __PUNCT__ entitl mindset where congress borrow from futur gener to fund lavish pet project that ar non __PUNCT__ essenti __PUNCT__
but let me be even more clear __PUNCT__ my plan end earmark for good __PUNCT__
it time to bring tough medicin to washington __PUNCT__
no longer will polici be set by k street __PUNCT__ it will be dictat by main street __PUNCT__
as i travel across thi countri __PUNCT__ and look voter in the ey __PUNCT__ i find that the american peopl __PUNCT__ though bruis __PUNCT__ ar not broken __PUNCT__
thei remain optimist about our countri if we get washington out of their wai __PUNCT__
and if the pundit and the establish think thei choos our presid __PUNCT__ primari and caucu voter haven't gotten the memo __PUNCT__
the american peopl ar not go to trim around the edg in __NUM__ thei ar go to turn washington insid out __PUNCT__
i am not the candid of the establish __PUNCT__
you won't hear a lot of shape __PUNCT__ shift nuanc from me __PUNCT__
i am go to give the american peopl a huge help of unbridl truth __PUNCT__ that we can't continu to spend what we ar spend __PUNCT__ that we can't avoid entitl reform becaus we ar afraid of third rail polit __PUNCT__
the fact is we can't spend our wai to prosper __PUNCT__
and we can't grow the bureaucraci in order to grow the economi __PUNCT__
there is a better wai __PUNCT__
it is to restor freedom to entrepreneur __PUNCT__ to our small __URL__ limit govern in order to creat unlimit opportun __PUNCT__
we will revers cours on the heavi hand of regul __PUNCT__ discard dodd __PUNCT__ frank and ani other regul that advanc a polit agenda at the expens of job and invest on main street __PUNCT__
it is time to let america be america again __PUNCT__
to return freedom to the peopl __PUNCT__
to stand on our found principl and reject the cynic polit of the nanni state __PUNCT__
to paraphras presid reagan __PUNCT__ washington isn't the answer to our challeng __PUNCT__ it is part of the problem __PUNCT__
it is time to get washington out of the wai in order to preserv the american wai __PUNCT__
thank you __PUNCT__ and god bless you all __PUNCT__
