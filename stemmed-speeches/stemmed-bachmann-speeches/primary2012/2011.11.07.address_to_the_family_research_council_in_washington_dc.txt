i like to thank toni perkin __PUNCT__ tom mccloski and the famili research council for host thi event todai __PUNCT__
i can't think of a better place than the famili research council to discuss the core of my convict that will guid how i govern if i were to becom presid of the unit state __PUNCT__
the famili research council ha been a beacon of light in protect the famili unit __PUNCT__ and i thank them for their leadership __PUNCT__
the most import promis that ani presid make to the american peopl is thi on __PUNCT__ i do solemnli swear that i will faithfulli execut the offic of presid of the unit state __PUNCT__ and will to the best of my abil __PUNCT__ preserv __PUNCT__ protect and defend the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__
so help me god __PUNCT__
too mani action by too mani presid demonstr that thi oath ha meant littl in recent year __PUNCT__
todai __PUNCT__ presid obama appear intent on stretch __PUNCT__ bend __PUNCT__ and ignor the constitut by abus execut power and pick and choos which law he will enforc __PUNCT__
my explan of constitut govern is for someth far more import than a menu of polici detail __PUNCT__
i want you to know the principl that will govern my decis make as presid __PUNCT__
when event aris and fact chang and congress interven __PUNCT__ polici have to adapt __PUNCT__
principl howev __PUNCT__ should be unchang __PUNCT__
thei should be the core of on convict __PUNCT__
the purpos of govern is to protect life __PUNCT__ liberti __PUNCT__ and properti __PUNCT__
presid obama believ the purpos of govern is to provid for our need and some of our want __PUNCT__
and he is will to engag in massiv redistribut of wealth and the polit of envi to achiev thi purpos __PUNCT__
i will understand from dai on what the current presid doe not __PUNCT__ when the american peopl entrust someon with the awesom power of the presid __PUNCT__ thei have given that person the privileg of serv under our constitut __PUNCT__ not a licens to put themselv abov it __PUNCT__
the presid econom polici __PUNCT__ most notabl obamacar __PUNCT__ repres the most ambiti social __PUNCT__ econom engin project in the histori of thi countri __PUNCT__
and thei threaten to rewrit the fundament assumpt of the role of govern in american live sinc the new deal and the great societi __PUNCT__
the __NUM__ command teach those shall not covet thy neighbor __PUNCT__ good __PUNCT__
it time to act on thi self __PUNCT__ evid truth __PUNCT__
america need to open it ey __PUNCT__
look at europ __PUNCT__
focu your attent on greec __PUNCT__
social is unsustain __PUNCT__
there simpli isn't enough monei to pai for all the want of all the peopl __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ while greec is crash presid obama ha call for more govern welfar __PUNCT__ more govern fund student loan __PUNCT__ more govern mortgag __PUNCT__ more govern spend to creat more govern job __PUNCT__
presid obama doesn't mere have the wrong polici __PUNCT__ he ha the wrong principl __PUNCT__
but sadli far too mani republican aspir to be frugal socialist __PUNCT__
the reason presid obama and some republican can get behind social medicin is becaus thei share the same core polit philosophi about the purpos of govern __PUNCT__
we cannot preserv liberti for ourselv and our poster if the choic in next __DATE__ is between a frugal socialist and an out __PUNCT__ of __PUNCT__ control socialist __PUNCT__
the govern given to us wa a constitut republ where the elect legisl make all of the law __PUNCT__
in fact __PUNCT__ the most import question for ani organ is __PUNCT__ who make the rule __PUNCT__ thi is true of the nfl __PUNCT__ a colleg student govern __PUNCT__ and it is certainli true of the unit state __PUNCT__
when presid obama issu execut order about student loan __PUNCT__ mortgag __PUNCT__ green energi plan __PUNCT__ or anyth els that directli control privat peopl or privat properti __PUNCT__ he is make law __PUNCT__
the presid or execut agenc should not make law __PUNCT__
on of the most seriou problem with obamacar is the number of time that the legisl sai __PUNCT__ the secretari shall make rule __PUNCT__ the rule on abort fund __PUNCT__ and countless other area __PUNCT__ ar not found in the obamacar bill itself __PUNCT__ but in the ream of rule that have begun to emerg from the secretari of health and human servic __PUNCT__
that is why i have been advoc for the repeal of obamacar from almost the minut it wa pass __PUNCT__
some have naiv said thei will issu waiver or execut order to stop obamacar __PUNCT__ but onli the full __PUNCT__ scale repeal can stop the cancer of obamacar from metastas across all of healthcar and our economi __PUNCT__
we cannot afford to have a candid who doesn't understand the complex of obamacar or the urgenc of it repeal __PUNCT__
congress need to take back the respons to pass all the law for our countri __PUNCT__
if the law ar bad __PUNCT__ the voter need to be abl to fire the peopl who wrote them __PUNCT__
likewis __PUNCT__ the judiciari doe not make the law __PUNCT__
presid obama believ judg can chang the mean of the constitut by reinterpret it word and by discov new unwritten right that the founder never contempl includ the us of un treati and other intern law to interpret our constitut __PUNCT__
a suprem court truli dedic to origin intent __PUNCT__ would look to the origin mean of the constitut __PUNCT__ to the record of the constitut convent __PUNCT__ the federalist paper __PUNCT__ and other contemporan legal sourc __PUNCT__
the un ha noth to sai to us about the mean of the unit state constitut __PUNCT__
i guarante that as presid everi singl judici nomine will have demonstr to my satisfact that thei ar unwaveringli commit to the rule of law __PUNCT__ as that law wa origin written __PUNCT__
presid obama ha commit to the ratif of a number of un treati includ the un convent on the right of the child when that would bind us to legal oblig internation and domest __PUNCT__
accord to articl vi of the constitut __PUNCT__ onc ratifi __PUNCT__ a treati becom a part of the suprem law of the land __PUNCT__
moreov __PUNCT__ ani state law that conflict with a treati is void __PUNCT__
virtual all american law regard parent and children is state law __PUNCT__
and thi un treati contain score of rule that contradict exist american law regard medic care __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ religion __PUNCT__ and virtual everi area of parent decis make __PUNCT__
thi treati threaten the most basic unit of govern that the famili research council and mani of the organ repres here todai attempt to defend __PUNCT__ the famili __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i will withdraw the signatur of the unit state from thi treati and everi other unratifi un treati of thi type __PUNCT__
the un is not the onli threat to the american famili __PUNCT__
some american offici have also gone too far in invad the legitim decis of american parent like be told by their doctor and insur compani __PUNCT__ that feder hipaa regul prevent them from obtain their children medic record and even medic test result __PUNCT__
thi is ridicul __PUNCT__ i wa an earli co __PUNCT__ sponsor of the parent right amend and i will assur passag of thi as presid __PUNCT__
in troxel v __PUNCT__ granvil __PUNCT__ justic scalia recent wrote that until parent right ar written into the actual text of the constitut __PUNCT__ there is no basi for a judg to protect parent right __PUNCT__
while he is just on justic __PUNCT__ the lower feder court ar in disarrai with far too mani feder judg reject the idea that parent right ar fundament __PUNCT__
judg mai be confus about the import of parent in the life of a child __PUNCT__
i don't share their confus __PUNCT__
make no mistak __PUNCT__ while not alwai possibl __PUNCT__ children ar best serv when thei ar rais in a home with a mom and a dad __PUNCT__ i will fight to protect the right of parent __PUNCT__ the famili and the institut of marriag __PUNCT__ those ar at the core of my convict __PUNCT__
the misinterpret of the commerc claus and the gener welfar claus in the constitut ar chiefli respons for the runawai debt and regulatori chao that threaten to crush our economi and curtail our liberti __PUNCT__
for exampl __PUNCT__ congress us the commerc claus to close all of the incandesc light bulb factori in the unit state and replac them with so __PUNCT__ call environment friendli bulb __PUNCT__
in respons __PUNCT__ i introduc the light bulb freedom of choic act __PUNCT__
but thi wasn't just about the right to choos what light bulb you wish __PUNCT__ it wa about our fundament right as citizen to not have the govern tell us how we ar to live out our daili live __PUNCT__
at my core is the belief that it is the american peopl and not the govern who know what is best for their live and that govern exist to protect that right to liberti and not to diminish it __PUNCT__
i believ the constitut assign on and onli on level of govern to deal with each area of polici __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha exclus jurisdict over foreign polici __PUNCT__ militari affair __PUNCT__ the protect of our border __PUNCT__ the mint of our monei __PUNCT__ and a few other topic __PUNCT__
state have exclus jurisdict over health __PUNCT__ educ __PUNCT__ welfar __PUNCT__ famili law __PUNCT__ and the vast major of crimin law __PUNCT__
the tenth amend tell us that if the subject is not assign to congress __PUNCT__ it remain by default with the state __PUNCT__
the peopl do not get doubl or tripl the servic when multipl layer of govern address the same issu __PUNCT__ we get conflict __PUNCT__ confus __PUNCT__ and unnecessari expens __PUNCT__
as presid __PUNCT__ i guarante you two thing __PUNCT__
first __PUNCT__ i will veto everi new law from congress that seek to add yet anoth layer of unconstitut regul under the guis of the commerc claus __PUNCT__
second __PUNCT__ i will begin the process of revers the damag from decad of great societi __PUNCT__ type program __PUNCT__
i will draw a line in the sand and do onli what the constitut allow __PUNCT__
on of the kei to steve job __PUNCT__ success wa that he said no to __NUM__ thing __PUNCT__
i guess he learn that wise principl from the founder __PUNCT__
the govern should do what it doe best __PUNCT__ protect the right to life __PUNCT__ liberti and the pursuit of happi and the privat sector in what should be freest societi on the face of earth should do what it doe best __PUNCT__ nurtur the engin of econom growth that ha made us the most prosper nation on the face of the earth __PUNCT__
we ar nearli __MONEY__ trillion in debt becaus of an improp view of the gener welfar claus __PUNCT__
the current view is that congress can spend unlimit monei on ani fool thing it want __PUNCT__
congress believ that the constitut impos no limit on it spend __PUNCT__
i beg to differ __PUNCT__
and i would point out that the found father also beg to differ __PUNCT__
in butler v __PUNCT__ unit state the suprem court address the question __PUNCT__ what limit on feder spend ar impos by the constitut __PUNCT__ the court point out that there wa a disput between alexand hamilton and jame madison on thi issu __PUNCT__
madison thought the spend power wa strictli limit to enumer power __PUNCT__ while hamilton believ that there wa addit power to spend in the gener welfar claus itself __PUNCT__
but hamilton view wa not the same as the theori in vogu in washington todai __PUNCT__
hamilton believ __PUNCT__ congress can spend monei on program that ar truli in the nation interest __PUNCT__ but onli for purpos that ar beyond the jurisdict of the state __PUNCT__
here is a practic exampl from histori __PUNCT__
thoma jefferson worri that hi louisiana purchas wa unconstitut becaus there wa no enumer power to make land purchas to expand the nation __PUNCT__
but hamilton believ the louisiana purchas wa justifi by the gener welfar claus becaus it wa beyond the power of the state to make such purchas __PUNCT__
like the louisiana purchas __PUNCT__ todai space program also pass thi constitut two __PUNCT__ part test for feder spend __PUNCT__ __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it is for the gener welfar and __NUM__ __PUNCT__ it is beyond the jurisdict of the state __PUNCT__
by contrast __PUNCT__ social welfar program ar within the jurisdict of the state __PUNCT__
both hamilton and madison would agre that the feder govern couldn't spend monei on welfar program __PUNCT__
educ also belong to the state __PUNCT__
the feder govern ha no constitut jurisdict to spend monei on educ program __PUNCT__
i repeal feder educ law __PUNCT__ close the depart of educ and let the state keep the monei thei been send to the feder govern to fuel the leviathan bureaucraci of the depart of educ where it employe make nearli doubl what the averag teacher in the classroom make __PUNCT__
our found father were realli veri effici polit planner __PUNCT__
thei gave each area of govern respons to on and onli on level of govern __PUNCT__
unless we want to go the wai of greec __PUNCT__ we have to adher to the organiz structur of the constitut and stop the feder govern from spend for purpos that ar onli within the jurisdict of the state __PUNCT__
as presid i will veto all new spend for new program that properli belong to the state and i will begin the systemat process of dismantl the current duplic __PUNCT__
i want to sai on veri import thing about articl iv of the constitut __PUNCT__
thi articl sai that congress ha the duti to guarante a republican form of govern __PUNCT__
the principl of self __PUNCT__ govern that there should be no taxat without represent wa the ralli cry __PUNCT__ and that principl li at the heart of what it mean to have a republican form of govern __PUNCT__
we ar violat the constitut commit to self __PUNCT__ govern for our poster by impos a crush burden of feder debt on our children __PUNCT__ grandchildren __PUNCT__ and the gener beyond __PUNCT__
georg washington warn against the __PUNCT__ progress accumul of debt which must ultim endang all govern __PUNCT__
for everi __MONEY__ of feder spend we ar onli pai for __MONEY__ with current tax __PUNCT__
we ar send the bill for the other __MONEY__ with compound interest __PUNCT__ to the gener yet to come __PUNCT__
futur citizen will be tax tomorrow for monei that alreadi been spent to financ a welfar state lurch toward declin __PUNCT__
yet __PUNCT__ futur gener had no vote on whether to spend thi monei __PUNCT__
that is an immor act and __PUNCT__ it is an unconstitut taxat without represent __PUNCT__
it is unconscion that we continu to borrow from futur prosper to live more comfort todai __PUNCT__
much of that spend and tax occur becaus govern doe what both the constitut and decent moral prohibit __PUNCT__ that is cronyism capit __PUNCT__ or forcefulli take your monei for the purpos of pai off a politician polit friend __PUNCT__
the problem is on set of standard for individu american and anoth set of standard for those who make polit donat to candid __PUNCT__
thi practic whether at the state level or the feder level is let the interest of the few outweigh the major of american who don't have access to the system __PUNCT__
i will end thi system of polit pai for plai that is out of control in washington __PUNCT__
the solut is beyond obviou __PUNCT__
what we all know what greec must do __PUNCT__ we must do ourselv __PUNCT__ and immedi __PUNCT__
i will honor the constitut by never send congress an unbalanc budget for their consider __PUNCT__ except in time of declar war __PUNCT__
and if congress pass an unbalanc budget __PUNCT__ thei better have two __PUNCT__ third of both hous behind their extravag __PUNCT__ becaus i promis you that i will veto such spend everi time __PUNCT__
in fiscal year __NUM__ the unit state gave awai __MONEY__ billion to countri like china __PUNCT__ mexico __PUNCT__ egypt __PUNCT__ and other nation each of whom own at least __MONEY__ billion in u. __PUNCT__ treasuri bond __PUNCT__
china own over __MONEY__ trillion in these bond __PUNCT__
thi is a signific portion of our nation debt __PUNCT__
give monei awai for free to the nation that own our debt instrument is like give your banker a larg gift while he still hold your unpaid mortgag __PUNCT__
i will stop such foreign aid at onc __PUNCT__
if these nation ar rich enough to loan us monei __PUNCT__ thei don't need our aid and we can't afford it __PUNCT__
the financi gift we ar make to china and these other will come to a screech halt of the dai i am sworn into offic __PUNCT__
my concern for children is not limit to protect them from financi bondag __PUNCT__
first and foremost __PUNCT__ i believ that everi child ha the right to life becaus everi child is made in the imag and like of a holi god __PUNCT__
i am not confus by what it mean to be __NUM__ percent pro __PUNCT__ life __PUNCT__
i am both person and publicli pro __PUNCT__ life __PUNCT__
i believ it is the role of govern to protect life from concept to natur death __PUNCT__
i never be confus about that issu and you won't find you tube clip with me advoc otherwis __PUNCT__
for starter __PUNCT__ plan parenthood will be zero out if i am presid __PUNCT__
i will also work to protect the american famili from activist judg who ar try to dismantl marriag as a legal institut sole between on man and on woman __PUNCT__
some republican candid seem confus about thi issu __PUNCT__
i am not __PUNCT__ it is the core of my convict __PUNCT__
i want a feder marriag amend so the court cannot impos their will on us __PUNCT__
when on state judiciari legal same sex marriag __PUNCT__ the legal pressur on everi state to recogn such marriag is profound __PUNCT__
on feder judg ha alreadi rule that the voter in california violat the feder constitut by vote to limit marriag to on man and on woman __PUNCT__
and presid obama ha order hi justic depart not to enforc the defens of marriag act __PUNCT__
that flaw analysi will be the path of futur activist court and an exampl for futur presid to overrun the will of the peopl and the legisl branch for their own will __PUNCT__
onli a feder marriag amend can prevent the court of on state from impos same __PUNCT__ sex marriag on us all __PUNCT__
on year from yesterdai __PUNCT__ the american public will make a decis about the futur direct of our countri __PUNCT__
we will decid what kind of nation we want to be __PUNCT__
i believ thi elect is the last exit ramp to regain our constitut heritag __PUNCT__
after that obamacar will be imposs to repeal __PUNCT__
do we want to be a free nation __PUNCT__ a nation that aspir to protect life __PUNCT__ liberti __PUNCT__ and properti __PUNCT__ or __PUNCT__ do we want to be a socialist nation __PUNCT__ commit to central govern provid all need for all peopl __PUNCT__ thi elect season ha been full of surpris __PUNCT__
i can assur you there ar no surpris with me __PUNCT__
i am far from a perfect person __PUNCT__ but i know who i am and i will never deviat from the principl that i have fought for all of my life __PUNCT__
i understand the challeng thi nation face __PUNCT__ both domest and foreign and i understand who ar our enemi and our alli __PUNCT__ and i prepar to face them __PUNCT__
if we want to have a real choic next __DATE__ __PUNCT__ the bold color of differ that reagan describ __PUNCT__ then it is crucial that the republican parti choos a candid in __DATE__ __PUNCT__ __DATE__ __PUNCT__ and march who is commit as i am to liberti and who ha demonstr a life long commit to fight to protect constitut govern __PUNCT__
i am the candid you can trust in offic becaus as presid i am and will be truli commit to preserv __PUNCT__ protect __PUNCT__ and defend the constitut of the unit state __PUNCT__
that commit is the core of my convict __PUNCT__
i will be such a presid __PUNCT__
