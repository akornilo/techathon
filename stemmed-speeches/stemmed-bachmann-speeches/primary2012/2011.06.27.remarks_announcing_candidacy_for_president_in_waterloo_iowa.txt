i want to bring a voic __PUNCT__ your voic __PUNCT__ to the white hous __PUNCT__ just as i have brought your voic to the hall of congress to secur the promis of the futur for our gener and gener to come __PUNCT__
i often sai that everyth i need to know i learn in iowa __PUNCT__
it wa at hawthorn and vallei park elementari school and my home __PUNCT__ both a short distanc from here __PUNCT__ where those iowan root were firmli plant __PUNCT__
it those root and my faith in god that guid me todai __PUNCT__
i a descend of gener iowan __PUNCT__
i know what it mean to be from iowa __PUNCT__ what we valu and what import __PUNCT__
those ar the valu that help make iowa the breadbasket of the world and those ar the valu __PUNCT__ the best of all of us that we must recaptur to secur the promis of the futur __PUNCT__
waterloo wa differ five decad ago when i grew up here __PUNCT__
that elementari school build wa a lot younger and for that matter so wa i __PUNCT__
five decad ago when i went there to school the hall were teem with young children who __PUNCT__ like me __PUNCT__ had dream of their futur __PUNCT__
a futur with promis and parent who want it to be fill with more opportun than thei had __PUNCT__
five decad ago america had less debt __PUNCT__ in fact our nation debt wa less than __NUM__ billion dollar __PUNCT__
a gallon of gasolin wa __NUM__ cent __PUNCT__ and own a home wa part of live the american dream __PUNCT__
todai our debt is over __NUM__ trillion dollar __PUNCT__ a gallon of ga is still outrag high __PUNCT__ million of home ar in foreclosur __PUNCT__ and those dream ar distant for mani american __PUNCT__
time have chang here in waterloo __PUNCT__ but the peopl still have the same spirit we iowan have come to exemplifi __PUNCT__
we work hard __PUNCT__ we live within our mean and we expect to pass on a better life to our children __PUNCT__
but our govern keep get bigger make it tougher for us to pass on that life __PUNCT__ caus our job to go oversea and spend more of the monei we make __PUNCT__ while we keep less of it __PUNCT__
don't mistak my happi memori of grow up in waterloo as pine for the past __PUNCT__
i recogn it imposs to turn the clock back and go back to a differ dai __PUNCT__
instead __PUNCT__ i want thi moment to serv as a remind about the best of who we ar as a nation __PUNCT__ what our valu ar __PUNCT__ and what went in to make america great to captur it best for the promis of the futur __PUNCT__
i want my candidaci for the presid to stand for the moment when __PUNCT__ we the peopl __PUNCT__ reclaim our independ from a govern that ha gotten too big __PUNCT__ spend too much and ha taken awai too much of our liberti __PUNCT__
american have alwai confront challeng __PUNCT__
our is a histori mark by struggl as well as prosper __PUNCT__
my earli dai were difficult as thei were for mani american __PUNCT__ especi dure the time when my mother struggl to rais us after divorc __PUNCT__
but we made our own wai __PUNCT__
we depend on our neighbor and ourselv and not our govern for help __PUNCT__
we trust in god and our neighbor and not in govern __PUNCT__
american still have that same spirit __PUNCT__
but govern keep try to eras it becaus govern think it know better __PUNCT__ that govern can creat job __PUNCT__ and make a better life for all of us __PUNCT__ even make us healthier __PUNCT__ but that not the case __PUNCT__
we have to recaptur our founder __PUNCT__ vision of a constitution conserv govern if we ar to secur the promis of the futur __PUNCT__
i also here becaus waterloo laid the foundat for my own root in polit __PUNCT__
i never thought that i would end up in public life __PUNCT__
i grew up here in iowa __PUNCT__
my grandpar ar buri here __PUNCT__
i rememb how sad i wa leav iowa to go to minnesota in the sixth grade __PUNCT__ becaus thi part of iowa wa all i knew __PUNCT__ i rememb tell my parent that we couldn't move to minnesota becaus i hadn't even been to de moin to see the state capitol __PUNCT__
i grew up a democrat __PUNCT__
my first involv in polit wa work for jimmi carter elect in __NUM__ __PUNCT__
but when i saw the direct presid carter took our countri __PUNCT__ how hi big spend liber major grew govern __PUNCT__ weaken our stand in the world __PUNCT__ and how thei decreas our liberti __PUNCT__ i becam a republican __PUNCT__
i rememb stand in the kitchen of my grandma hous on lafayett street in waterloo listen to my dad __PUNCT__ a democrat debat the merit of the great societi with my grandmoth __PUNCT__ a republican __PUNCT__
i rememb her prophet admonit to my father that the great societi wouldn't work becaus it wouldn't be my father gener who paid for it __PUNCT__ but rather my brother __PUNCT__ david and me __PUNCT__
and now that predict ha come true and neither my democrat father nor my republican grandmoth would have condon thi spend and debt __PUNCT__
i hadn't plan on get into polit __PUNCT__
i love the law and went to law school __PUNCT__
i went on to william and mari to becom a tax lawyer __PUNCT__
togeth with my husband we start a success small busi __PUNCT__
when i saw the problem with our local school district and how academ excel wa be erod by feder govern interfer with the local school __PUNCT__ i decid to do more than just complain about it __PUNCT__
on of those iowa valu instil in me wa to alwai leav whatev you were involv with better than when you found it __PUNCT__ so i decid to seek public offic to make our local school district better __PUNCT__
i didn't seek public offic for fortun or power __PUNCT__ but simpli to make life better in our commun and educ better for our children __PUNCT__
and now i seek the presid not for vaniti __PUNCT__ but becaus america is at a crucial moment and i believ that we must make a bold choic if we ar to secur the promis of the futur __PUNCT__
we cannot continu to kick the can of our problem down the road __PUNCT__ becaus thei ar problem of todai and not tomorrow __PUNCT__
we cannot continu to rack up debt on the back of futur gener __PUNCT__
we can't afford an unconstitut health plan that cost too much and is worth so littl __PUNCT__
and we can't afford four more year of fail leadership at home and abroad __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of million of american out of work or in job that pai too littl to support their famili __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of a hous crisi that is devalu our home and make home ownership imposs for mani american __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of a foreign polici that lead from behind and doesn't stand up for our friend and stand up to our enemi __PUNCT__
we can't afford four more year of barack obama __PUNCT__
as a constitut conserv __PUNCT__ i believ in the found father vision of a limit govern that trust in and preserv the unlimit potenti of the american peopl __PUNCT__
i don't believ that the solut to our problem come from washington __PUNCT__ more than ever __PUNCT__ washington is the problem __PUNCT__ and the real solut will come from our busi __PUNCT__ our commun __PUNCT__ our school and the most basic and power unit of all __PUNCT__ our famili __PUNCT__

american agre that our countri is in peril todai and we must act with urgenc to save it __PUNCT__
and american aren't interest in affili __PUNCT__ thei ar interest in solut __PUNCT__ and leadership that will tell the truth __PUNCT__
and the truth is that american ar the solut and not the govern __PUNCT__ thi elect is about big issu __PUNCT__ not petti on __PUNCT__
